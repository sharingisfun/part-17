She's suicidal. A nurse sees her weeping in public and takes her home. Her mother hires the nurse, GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve, to care for CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line; GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve imposes the same work and meditation regime she herself used to recover from similar depression two years before. The film plays out the resulting dynamics: CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line has mystical success in meditation, and neighbor children discover she has healing powers. Yet life remains painful. Meanwhile, the friendship is now the center of GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve's life. When CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©line leaves, GeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve must cope anew with loss.
