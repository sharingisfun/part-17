HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found a new loveÃ¢â‚¬â€a woman his dog, Marlowe, approves ofÃ¢â‚¬â€and his best human friend is reluctantly coming to grips with how...unusual...RemyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions can be. And heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally reached a kind of peace between his true angelic nature and the human persona he created for himself so very long ago.\n\nBut that peace canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lastÃ¢â‚¬â€Heaven and the Legions of the Fallen still stand on the brink of war. Then one of HeavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest generals is murdered, and it falls to Remy to discover whoÃ¢â‚¬â€or whatÃ¢â‚¬â€might be responsible for the death, which could trigger the final conflict...a conflict in which Earth will most certainly be the beachhead.\n \nThe deeper he digs, the further he goes into a dark world of demonic assassins, secret brothels, and things that are unsettling even to a being who has lived since time began. But it is not in his natureÃ¢â‚¬â€angelic or humanÃ¢â‚¬â€to stop until he has found the killer, no matter the personal price....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfe3fb68f5fef53b8a783c28e1f4cd81d102684d","amp;dn":"Thomas+E+Sniegoski+-+%5BRemy+Chandler+06%5D+-+Walking+in+the+Midst+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfe3fb68f5fef53b8a783c28e1f4cd81d102684d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,227,251,104,245,254,245,59,138,120,60,40,225,244,205,129,209,2,104,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
