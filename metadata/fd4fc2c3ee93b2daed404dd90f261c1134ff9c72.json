H. LAWRENCE (1885-1930) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic and painter.\n\nLawrence's opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile which he called his &quot;savage pilgrimage.&quot;  At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents.  E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as &quot;the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation.&quot;  Today Lawrence is widely considered -- alongside James Joyce and Virginia Woolf -- as one of the great modernist English-language writers.  His linguistic precision, mastery of a wide range of subject matters and genres, psychological complexity and exploration of female sexuality distinguish him as one of the most refined and revolutionary English writers of the early 20th century.\n\nHis many works include SONS AND LOVERS (1913) and WOMEN IN LOVE (1920), but he is best known for his infamous LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER (1928), a graphic and highly sexual novel that was banned in the U.S. until 1959 and in England until 1960.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                                    == Novels ==\n\n* AARON'S ROD (Penguin, 1995).
