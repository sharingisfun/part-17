Every day he dreamed of being with the mercenary &quot;Light Finding Operation (LFO)&quot; aircraft pilot group &quot;Gekkostate&quot; and riding &quot;Trapar&quot; particle waves-- a sport called &quot;reffing&quot;-- with their charismatic leader Holland, especially when faced with his father's acclaimed past or his grandfather's desire to protect him. When a young girl named Eureka riding the original LFO, the &quot;Nirvash typeZERO&quot;, asks his grandfather for a tune-up, she inadvertently brings the attention of the military to the garage; as a result, the garage is destroyed and Renton is forced to deliver a new type of interface-- the &quot;Amita Drive&quot;-- to the Nirvash. After a heated fight in which the Nirvash destroys the military LFOs by unleashing an immense amount of power, Renton is invited into Gekkostate. However, he quickly realizes that behind the facade of a traveling group of mercenaries is a very bitter reality.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you are not able to open files or want to watch in better quality.\nUse KMPlayer     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4595030/The_KMPlayer_2.9.4.1434&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4595030/The_KMPlayer_2.9.4.1434&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nand use CCCP codec pack    &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3664665/CCCP_(Combined_Community_Codec_Pack)_2007.02.22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3664665/CCCP_(Combined_Community_Codec_Pack)_2007.02.22&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFor blu-rays and high quality videos     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4403094/CoreAVC_H.264_Video_Codec_Professional_v1.8.0.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4403094/CoreAVC_H.264_Video_Codec_Professional_v1.8.0.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055d1d77567d9e50011f7013ddd58bab357f9aad","amp;dn":"Eureka+Seven+1-50+%28x246%29%28subbed%29+.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055d1d77567d9e50011f7013ddd58bab357f9aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,93,29,119,86,125,158,80,1,31,112,19,221,213,139,171,53,127,154,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
