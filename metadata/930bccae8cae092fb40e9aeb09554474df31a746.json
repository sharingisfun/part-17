Freddy and Manuel had met in school and played in Los Hang Ten's. Freddy and his older brother Jose originally thought of founding &quot;Traffic Sound&quot;.\nThe name was chosen because of their penchant for a traffic light, placed as a souvenir in the attic of the Rizo-PatrÃƒÂ³ns house, where they held their practices, after a wild night in Lima.\n\n\n\nAlbums\n\n- A Bailar Go Go (1968)\n- Virgin (1969)\n- Traffic Sound, a.k.a.
