Walker, Richard M. Sibly, Steve P. Hopkin &amp; David B. Peakall.\n\nTEXTBOOK INFO: &lt;a href=&quot; https://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439862667&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439862667&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFEATURES:\n * Demonstrates the interdisciplinary character of ecotoxicology\n * Describes major classes of organic and inorganic pollutants,\n   their entry into the environment, and their movement, storage,\n   and transformation within the environment\n * Discusses the effects of pollutants on living organisms at the molecular,\n   cellular, and individual level\n * Relates mechanisms of toxicity to ecological effects at the level of\n   populations, communities, and ecosystems\n * Considers how concepts of ecotoxicology may contribute to improved methods\n   of environmental risk assessment\n * Addresses the problem of progressing from measuring concentrations of\n   environmental chemicals to establishing their effects upon individuals,\n   populations, and communities\n * Includes numerous examples, case studies, and more than 150 illustrations\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS:\n--------------\nIntroduction\nSECTION I - Pollutants and Their Fate in Ecosystems\n 1.
