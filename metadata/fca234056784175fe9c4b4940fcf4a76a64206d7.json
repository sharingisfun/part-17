With the glut of information available today, anything your organization wants to share should be easy to find, navigate, and understand. But the experience you provide has to be familiar and coherent across multiple interaction channels, from the Web to smartphones, smartwatches, and beyond.\r\n\r\nTo guide you through this broad ecosystem, this popular guideâ€”now in its fourth editionâ€”provides essential concepts, methods, and techniques for digital design that have withstood the test of time. UX designers, product managers, developers, and anyone involved in digital design will learn how to create semantic structures that will help people engage with your message.\r\n\r\nThis book includes:\r\n\r\nAn overview of IA and the problems it solves for creating effective digital products and services\r\nA deep dive into IA components, including organization, labeling, navigation, search, and metadata\r\nProcesses and methods that take you from research to strategy, design, and IA implementation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fca234056784175fe9c4b4940fcf4a76a64206d7","amp;dn":"Information+Architecture+-+4th+Ed+%282015%29+%28Pdf%2CEpub%2CMobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fca234056784175fe9c4b4940fcf4a76a64206d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,162,52,5,103,132,23,95,233,196,180,148,15,207,74,118,166,66,6,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
