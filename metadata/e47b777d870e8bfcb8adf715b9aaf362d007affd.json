By the mid 1960s, they had become an internationally famous rock-and-roll act (the Vocal Group Hall of Fame has stated that it was the most popular rock band before The Beatles). Since 1967, they have been known off and on as Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, though not identified as such on any of their records.\nIn 1960, the group known as The Four Lovers evolved into The Four Seasons, with Frankie Valli as the lead singer, Bob Gaudio (formerly of The Royal Teens) on keyboards and tenor vocals, Tommy DeVito on lead guitar and baritone vocals, and Nick Massi on bass guitar and bass vocals (Massi was replaced in 1965 by Charles Calello, who was in turn replaced later in 1965 by Joe Long on bass guitar and bass vocals).\nThe legal name of the organization is the Four Seasons Partnership, formed by Gaudio and Valli after a failed audition in 1961. While singers, producers, and musicians have come and gone, Gaudio and Valli remain the group's constant (with each owning fifty percent of the act and its assets, including virtually all of its recording catalog). Gaudio no longer plays live, leaving Valli the only member of the group from its inception that is currently touring. \nThe Four Seasons (group members 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1965) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, and it joined the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999. It is one of the best-selling musical groups of all time, having sold 175 million records worldwide. \n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks, thanks and thanks so mutch........!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47b777d870e8bfcb8adf715b9aaf362d007affd","amp;dn":"The+Four+Seasons-album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47b777d870e8bfcb8adf715b9aaf362d007affd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,123,119,125,135,14,139,252,184,173,247,21,185,170,243,98,208,7,175,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
