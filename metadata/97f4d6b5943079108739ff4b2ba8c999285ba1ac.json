How about preparing a traditional Balinese banquet? Or take a trip to the Hebrides and enjoy a Scottish feast? The Ethnomusicologists' Cookbook takes you around the world on a culinary journey that is also a cultural and social odyssey.\nMany cookbooks offer a snapshot of individual recipes from different parts of the world, but do nothing to tell the reader how different foods are presented together, or how to relate these foods to other cultural practices. For years, ethnomusicologists have visited the four corners of the earth to collect the music and culture of native peoples, from Africa to the Azores, from Zanzibar to New Zealand. Along the way, they've observed how music is an integral part of social interaction, particularly when it's time for a lavish banquet or celebration. Foodways and cultural expression are not separate; this book emphasizes this connection through offering over 35 complete meals, from appetizers to entrees to side dishes to desserts and drinks. A list of recommended CDs fills out the culinary experience, along with hints on how to present each dish and to organize the overall meal.\nThe Ethnomusicologists' Cookbook combines scholarship with a unique and fun approach to the study of the world's foods, musics, and cultures. More than just a cookbook, it is an excellent companion for anyone embarking on a cultural-culinary journey.\n\nBook Image:\nhttp://www.image-upload.net/images/o4lwf6pmkdkqzy7swmr.jpg\n\nPlZ Seed...\n\nThnXX...\n\nmAnaV...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f4d6b5943079108739ff4b2ba8c999285ba1ac","amp;dn":"The+Ethnomusicologists%5C%27s+Cookbook+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97f4d6b5943079108739ff4b2ba8c999285ba1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,244,214,181,148,48,121,16,135,57,255,75,43,168,201,153,40,91,161,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
