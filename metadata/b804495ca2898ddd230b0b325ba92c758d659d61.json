Simply right click the folder or file and select Unlocker\n\n\n\n\n2. If the folder or file is locked, a window listing of lockers will appear\n\n\n\n\n3. Simply click Unlock All and you are done!\n\n\nSimilar programs and why Unlocker is better\n\nOf course I only compare here the unlocking features. Process Explorer and Take Control are very good programs featuring much more things than just unlocking folders. The goal of this list is not really to pretend Unlocker is better but instead to provide a list of all other alternative programs in case you have some difficulties with Unlocker.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b804495ca2898ddd230b0b325ba92c758d659d61","amp;dn":"File+Unlocker+1.9.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b804495ca2898ddd230b0b325ba92c758d659d61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,4,73,92,162,137,141,221,35,11,11,50,91,169,44,117,141,101,157,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
