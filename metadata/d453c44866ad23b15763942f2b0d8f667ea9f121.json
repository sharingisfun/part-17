The very first book to be published on the subject, Combinatorics of Permutations contains a comprehensive, up to date treatment of the subject. Covering both enumerative and external combinatorics, this book can be used as either a graduate text or as a reference for professional mathematicians. The book includes many applications from computer science, molecular biology, probabilistic methods, and pattern avoidance, and the numerous exercises show readers a fairly comprehensive list of recent results from the field.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d453c44866ad23b15763942f2b0d8f667ea9f121","amp;dn":"Combinatorics+of+Permutations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d453c44866ad23b15763942f2b0d8f667ea9f121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,83,196,72,102,173,35,177,87,99,148,47,43,13,143,102,126,169,241,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
