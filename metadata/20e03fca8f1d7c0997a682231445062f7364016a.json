Muslims believe the Qur'an, in its original Arabic, to be the literal word of God that was revealed to Muhammad over a period of twenty-three years until his death. Muslims regard it as God's final revelation to humankind and view it as the closest thing to a part of God in the world.[2] Muslims also call the Qur'an the &quot;Final Testament&quot;, &quot;The Book&quot;, &quot;Book of God&quot; or &quot;The Revelation.&quot;\n\nThe Qur'anic revelations were originally memorized by Muhammad's companions as Muhammad spoke them, with some being written down by one or more companions on whatever was at hand, from stones to pieces of bark. Compilations of the Qu'ran began under the Caliph Umar, but it was Uthman who decided upon a definitive copy and destroyed all other versions. All Muslims use the same Qur'an with no differences among the sects. The Qu'ran has never changed in substance since. Muslims generally consider it to be the most beautiful book in Arabic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e03fca8f1d7c0997a682231445062f7364016a","amp;dn":"Three+Translations+of+The+Koran+%28Al-Qur%27an%29+side+by+side+by+Abdu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e03fca8f1d7c0997a682231445062f7364016a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,224,63,202,143,29,124,9,151,166,130,35,20,69,6,47,115,100,1,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
