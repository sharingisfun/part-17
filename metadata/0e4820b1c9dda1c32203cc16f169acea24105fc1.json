It is notable for the fact that McCartney, a multi-instrumentalist, performed the entire album (all instruments and voices) by himself, except for some backing vocals from his first wife, Linda McCartney. McCartney stated that he played &quot;bass, drums, acoustic guitar, lead guitar, piano, Mellotron, organ, toy xylophone, and bow and arrow&quot; on the album. Notable, also, is the use of a large number of instrumental tracks.\n\n\nThe development of McCartney was undertaken as the Beatles were falling apart. Recordings were made from late 1969 to March 1970 in London at his home, at Morgan Studios, and at Abbey Road Studios (under the pseudonym &quot;Billy Martin&quot;). McCartney had brought his instruments with him, as well as a Studer four-track tape recorder. He recorded the ad-libbed &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot; to test the equipment before the year was out. Enjoying the experience, he continued, composing and improvising new material and overdubbing his singing. In March 1970, as Phil Spector was concurrently mixing the Let It Be album, McCartney was completed.\n\nThe other Beatles realised that McCartney could conflict with the impending release of the Let It Be album and film. Ringo Starr, whose own first album was almost ready for release, was sent to ask McCartney to delay his solo debut. McCartney later commented, &quot;They eventually sent Ringo round to my house at Cavendish with a message: 'We want you to put your release date back, it's for the good of the group', and all of this sort of shit. He was giving me the party line; they just made him come round, so I did something I'd never done before or since: I told him to get out. I had to do something like that in order to assert myself because I was just sinking. I was getting pummeled about the head, in my mind anyway.&quot;\n\nOn 10 April, McCartney publicly announced his departure from the Beatles in the form of a Q &amp; A package included in advance copies of the album sent to the press, containing questions McCartney could ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and probably would ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ have been asked about the Beatles' break-up and their future. He stated that he did not know whether the group's break-up would be temporary or permanent (the complete questionnaire, as well as McCartney's own song-by-song commentary, is included in Richard DiLello's book, The Longest Cocktail Party, as an appendix).\n\nOne of the most notable songs on the album is &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;, one of McCartney's many love songs for his first wife, which later went on to reach No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 upon being released as a single on the 1976 album Wings over America. McCartney has subsequently revealed that Linda was instrumental in bolstering his spirits and confidence during the album's making, and helping him out of his depression over losing the Beatles.\n\nIn 1993, McCartney was remastered and reissued on CD as part of &quot;The Paul McCartney Collection&quot; series. There were no bonus tracks available.\n\n\n2011 Hear Music re-issue:\n\nIn 2011 the album was re-issued by Hear Music/Concord Music Group as part of, The Paul McCartney Archive Collection.\n\nThe album was released in four different versions: a standard one disc version of the remastered album, a two-disc special edition with the second disc containing bonus audio tracks, a two-disc 180-gram remastered vinyl, and a deluxe two-CD and one-DVD version that contains a 128-page hardcover book with never-before-published photos and all-new liner notes.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nSide 1\n\n01.
