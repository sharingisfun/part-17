This is true. But i am at least trying to explain one phenomenon - economic development-with another that co-existed with it - protectionism. Free trade economists have to explain how free trade can be an explanation for the economic success of today's rich countries, when it simply had not been practised very much before they became rich.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n                                                            \n                             Ha-Joon Chang\n======================================================================================================================================================================\n\nUsing irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“World Is FlatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ orthodoxy of Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economic superpowersÃ¢â‚¬â€from the US to Britain to his native KoreaÃ¢â‚¬â€all attained prosperity by shameless protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free trade andÃ¢â‚¬â€via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and World Trade OrganizationÃ¢â‚¬â€ramming policies that suit ourselves down the throat of the developing world.\n\n\nREVIEWS:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Lucid, deeply informed, and enlivened with striking illustrations, this penetrating study could be entitled Ã¢â‚¬ËœEconomics in the Real World.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Chang reveals the yawning gap between standard doctrines concerning economic development and what really has taken place from the origins of the industrial revolution until today. His incisive analysis shows how, and why, prescriptions based on reigning doctrines have caused severe harm, particularly to the most vulnerable and defenseless, and are likely to continue to do so.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Noam Chomsky\n\n&quot;A smart, lively and provocative book that offers us compelling new ways to look at globalization &quot; -- Joseph E. Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in Economics, 2001\n\n &quot;Every orthodoxy needs effective critics. Ha-Joon Chang is probably the world's most effective critic of globalization. He does not deny the benefits to developing countries of integration into the world economy. But he draws on the lessons of history to argue that they must be allowed to integrate on their own terms&quot; -- Martin Wolf, Financial Times, author of 'Why Globalization Works'\n\n &quot;This is a marvellous book. Well researched, panoramic in its scope and beautifully written, Bad Samaritans, is the perfect riposte to devotees of a one-size-fits-all model of growth and globalization. I strongly urge you to read it&quot; -- Larry Elliott, Economics Editor, Guardian \n\n&quot;In this more polemical tract, [Chang] adds the spark of personal reflection ... and some mischievous rhetorical set-pieces.&quot; The Economist \n\n\n&quot;This is an excellent book...deploys the logical discipline of economics and its engagement with quantitative evidence, but does so in jargon-free prose that sparkles with anecdotes and practical observations.&quot; International Affair\n\n\nHa-Joon Chang is one of the leading heterodox economists and institutional economists specialising in development economics. Currently a Reader in the Political Economy of Development at the University of Cambridge, Chang is the author of several widely-discussed policy books, most notably Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective (2002).He also writes regularly for the Guardian. Chang was ranked by Prospect Magazine as one of the top World Thinkers in 2013.\n\n===========================================================\nBook Details::\nISBN:978-1596915985\nPages:117(epub) in SumatraPdf\nPublisher:Bloomsbury\nYear:2007\n===========================================================\nPart of Ha Joon Chang collection","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a86387e1f7206bdd7845ab11fee9997ceb5b4781","amp;dn":"Bad+Samaritans-The+Guilty+Secrets+of+Rich+Nations+and+the+Threat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a86387e1f7206bdd7845ab11fee9997ceb5b4781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,99,135,225,247,32,107,221,120,69,171,17,254,233,153,124,235,91,71,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
