Fast handling, low cost and reliable, these rifles have been imported from China and Russia by the tens of thousands. Our cutaway close-ups will show you how this system inspired, but differs from the AK-47 and AKS. Due to current bans on importation, spare parts may be hard to get and fitting them requires special considerations which this course covers in detail. There are numerous accessories for the SKS, however, some (such as adding a folding stock) might make the rifle illegal! Find our how to keep yourself safe and legal. Improving the accuracy of your SKS is also covered.\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cba7204303db27b31f910215e5b56d177fa76b2a","amp;dn":"AGI-+The+AK+Armorer+Course","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cba7204303db27b31f910215e5b56d177fa76b2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,167,32,67,3,219,39,179,31,145,2,21,229,181,109,23,127,167,107,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
