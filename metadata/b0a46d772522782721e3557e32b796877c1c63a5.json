Almost two decades after the end of hostilities, the Vietnam War remains a dominant moral, political and military touchstone in American cultural consciousness.\nVietnam War Stories provides a comprehensive critical framework for understanding the Vietnam experience, Vietnam narratives and modern war literature. The narratives examined - personal accounts as well as novels - portray a soldier's and a country's journey from pre-war innocence, through battlefield experience and consideration, to a difficult post-war adjustment. Tobey Herzog places these narratives within the context of important cultural and literary themes, including inherent ironies of war, the &quot;John Wayne syndrome&quot; of pre-war innocence, and the &quot;heavy Heart-of-Darkness trip&quot; of the conflict itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a46d772522782721e3557e32b796877c1c63a5","amp;dn":"Vietnam+War+Stories%3A+Innocence+Lost","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0a46d772522782721e3557e32b796877c1c63a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,164,109,119,37,34,120,39,33,227,85,126,50,183,150,135,124,28,99,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
