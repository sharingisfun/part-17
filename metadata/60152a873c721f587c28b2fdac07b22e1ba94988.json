She loves hearing from her readers, and has a distinct sense of humor. \n\nRight now she's living in a home with zone heating &amp; decent plumbing, but hopes to some day put turrets and ramparts on it so that it looks like a castle.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy\n\n\nThe Tower by Jean Johnson (Guardians of Destiny #1) \n\nIn a fertile valley undisrupted by the aether-shattering death of the old Aian Empire, the Tower and its Guardians have entertained generations of wealthy mirror-scrying mages while adventurers from around the world risk their lives for fortune and fame. But on the one day the Tower stood unguarded, an intruder tried to seize the magic powering the vast structure. Now, locked out of the TowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innermost chambers, Kerric Vo Mos must brave the deadly traps keeping trespassers at bay in order to reclaim control.\n\nUnfortunately, Kerric wields a pen far better than a sword, and the way into the TowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sanctum is treacherous. Only the help of an experienced player like Myal the Mendhite can get him to where he must go. But mutual respect will not be enough. Passion must also be employed, along with armor and weapons, as they embark on a perilous quest past monsters, riddles, and other dangers that even the TowerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dedicated viewers have never seen before. \n\nThe Grove by Jean Johnson (Guardians of Destiny #2)\n\nCalm the magics caught in thrall:\nPut your faith in strangersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pleas,\nWatcher, Witch, and treasure trove;\nRide the wave to calm the trees,\nServant saves the sacred grove.\n\nAt the behest of their leader, the Witches of Darkhana are mobilized. Their mission: gather the most honest, true servants of each deity so that they may respectfully represent their land at the reopening of the Convocation of Gods and Man. For Witch-Priest Aradin Teral, his part in the quest has taken him across the length and breadth of Katan, searching for the best possible representative of an empire bent on preventing that very task.\n\nEver since the destruction of the last Convocation, the magics of the Grove have been warped, endangering pilgrims and residents alike and requiring the guardianship of the strongest mage the priesthood can spare. Priestess Saleria is now the Keeper of the Grove, and Guardian of the Divine Garden. The arrival of a black-robed stranger bearing the faces of two men brings the promise of change, even peace, to the isolated valley. But it also ushers in an irresistible passion and a threat to SaleriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s control of the wildest magics in the woodsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Guild by Jean Johnson (Guardians of Destiny #3)\n\nFor centuries, the mages of Mekhana have done their best to hide themselves and their powers from the rapacious needs of their so-called Patron Deity, Mekha. Greatest of their secrets is the Vortex, a Fountain hidden in the heart of the Hydraulics Guild. But even after the dissolution of Mekha and the freeing of his people, Alonnen isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ready to reveal his guardianship to outsiders. Particularly when the remnants of MekhaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s priesthood start looking for a new monstrosity to worship.\n\nRexei has hidden more than her powers for most of her life; she has also hidden her gender, wary of the hungers of the old priesthood. Only in the safety of the Hydraulics GuildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innermost secrets can she be herself. While the rest of her people struggle to reinvent themselves and find a deity they can trust, Rexei struggles to trust just one man, the Guardian of the Vortex. Events are moving fast, though; the priesthood is desperate for any new source of power, even a demonic one that requires certain sacrifices to access.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60152a873c721f587c28b2fdac07b22e1ba94988","amp;dn":"Guardians+of+Destiny+Series+by+Jean+Johnson+%2801-03%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60152a873c721f587c28b2fdac07b22e1ba94988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,21,42,135,60,114,31,88,124,40,178,253,172,7,178,46,27,169,73,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
