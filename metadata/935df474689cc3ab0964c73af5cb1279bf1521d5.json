It uses the Windows ASPI Interface, so both SCSI and ATAPI CD-ROM drives are supported.\n\nIt supports hidden sector synchronization and has a secure, fast and burst extraction method selectable. Fast extraction should get the same speed as other grabbers, but is probably not exact anymore. Burst mode just grabs the audio data without any synchronization.\n\nIt allows you to output of time positions of all non-exact corrections and listen to these positions. You can also copy of ranges of music data, not only tracks. Automatic Speed reduction on errors and fallback afterwards ensures that your music will still sound decent. It uses the Windows Audio Compression Manager for direct compression to MP3 or WAV.\n\nIt also supports external MP3, VQF, RA and AAC encoders for automatic compression after extraction. Filename editing is easy with local and remote CDDB database and CDPLAYER.INI support and more features like ID3 tagging.\n\nExact Audio Copy also uses LAME enconding engine. If you do not have LAME already installed, download it here.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:935df474689cc3ab0964c73af5cb1279bf1521d5","amp;dn":"Exact+Audio+Copy+v0.99+prebeta+2+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"935df474689cc3ab0964c73af5cb1279bf1521d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,93,244,116,104,156,195,171,9,100,199,58,245,203,18,121,191,21,33,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
