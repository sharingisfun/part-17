The series was the first to introduce the step-by-step protocols approach that has become the standard in all biomedical protocol publishing. Each protocol is provided in readily-reproducible step-by-step fashion, opening with an introductory overview, a list of the materials and reagents needed to complete the experiment, and followed by a detailed procedure that is supported with a helpful notes section offering tips and tricks of the trade as well as troubleshooting advice.&quot;\n\nVolumes - 1-301","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:427c30b51e104499a14ff9a6b0072540313d2f05","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Molecular+Biology+%281-301%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"427c30b51e104499a14ff9a6b0072540313d2f05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,124,48,181,30,16,68,153,161,79,249,166,176,7,37,64,49,61,47,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
