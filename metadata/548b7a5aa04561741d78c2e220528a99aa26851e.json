The song was written primarily by Paul McCartney and is credited to the Lennon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ McCartney duo.\n\nThe song continued the transformation of the Beatles from a mainly pop-oriented act to a more experimental, studio-based band. With a double string quartet arrangement by George Martin and striking lyrics about loneliness, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; broke sharply with popular music conventions, both musically and lyrically. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic cites the band's &quot;singing about the neglected concerns and fates of the elderly&quot; on the song as &quot;just one example of why the Beatles' appeal reached so far beyond the traditional rock audience.&quot;\n\nPaul McCartney came up with the melody of &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; as he experimented with his piano. However, the original name of the protagonist that he chose was not Eleanor Rigby but Miss Daisy Hawkins. The singer-composer Donovan reported that he heard McCartney play it to him before it was finished, with completely different lyrics.\n\nIn 1966, McCartney recalled how he got the idea for his song:\n\nI was sitting at the piano when I thought of it. The first few bars just came to me, and I got this name in my head... 'Daisy Hawkins picks up the rice in the church'. I don't know why. I couldn't think of much more so I put it away for a day. Then the name Father McCartney came to me, and all the lonely people. But I thought that people would think it was supposed to be about my Dad sitting knitting his socks. Dad's a happy lad. So I went through the telephone book and I got the name 'McKenzie'.\n\n&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; was important in the Beatles' evolution from a pop, live-performance band to a more experimental, studio-oriented band, though the track contains little studio trickery. In a 1967 interview, Pete Townshend of The Who commented, &quot;I think 'Eleanor Rigby' was a very important musical move forward. It certainly inspired me to write and listen to things in that vein.&quot;\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rigby&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rigby&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KApIiAaeH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KApIiAaeH&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:01\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
