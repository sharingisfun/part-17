My motivation in making this torrent available is not to promote Nazism itself or racism but instead to make available to conspiracy researchers and others source material that has largely been inaccessible in the U.S. and the UK. There's a reason that it's been inaccessible: it's all in German. All of the texts in the torrent are in German with one exception: an English translation of Lanz von Liebenfel's &quot;Theozoologie&quot;, which is unavailable elsewhere. &quot;The Secret of the Runes&quot; by Guido von List has not been included because an English edition is widely available through Inner Traditions Publications. My hope is that there are a few people within the world of Anglo=American research on these subjects who speak enough German to be able to either translate the texts into English or else to meaningfully use them in preparation of further works on the subject. \n\nI should also mention that just because an author has written about Germanic subjects doesn't mean that they are automatically racist, or anti-semitic. While some authors such as Liebenfels clearly were, others such as List were less so, even though they may have supported vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶lkisch ideas.\n\n\nIf it is illegal for you to download these files in the country that you live in please do not do so.\n\nThe files included, with brief descriptions, are these:\n\nTheodor Fritsch--Handbook on the Jewish Question, Hanbuch fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼r Judenfrage, 1907\nNot an occult book but a representative book by a member of the Germanenorden\n\nGorsleben--The Prose Edda [analysis],  Die Erzaehlende Edda, 1924\nFounder of the Edda Society, a Listian rune researcher, briefly associated with the Thule Society.\n\nGorsleben--Heydey of Humanity, Hoch-Zeit der Menschheit, 1930\n\n\nHaushoffer, Karl-- World Politics Today, Weltpolitik von heute, 1935\nBook by geo-politics author widely rumored to have been a participant in occult organizations\n\nHelsing, Jan van--Secret Societies and their power in the 20th Century, Geheimgesellschaften und ihre Macht im 20.
