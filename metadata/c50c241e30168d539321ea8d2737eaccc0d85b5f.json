Yet, in some ways, this is less about the girls and more about their mother, Alexandra, whose despair at producing four girls before giving birth to a hemophiliac son, is palpable. Rappaport uses the sisters? letters and diaries to illuminate their lives, but they rarely jump off the pages as real people, even though they are each described with specific personality traits. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is when their relationships with the magnetic Rasputin are introduced that the girls seem the most alive. What also comes through quite clearly is the great love and devotion each of the Romanov family members felt for each other, despite living through the harshest of circumstances. The haunting cover photograph of the Romanov sisters will draw readers, and the extensive bibliography will aid those who want to learn more. --Ilene Cooper \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c50c241e30168d539321ea8d2737eaccc0d85b5f","amp;dn":"The+Romanov+Sisters+-+Helen+Rappaport++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c50c241e30168d539321ea8d2737eaccc0d85b5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,12,36,30,48,22,141,83,147,33,234,141,39,55,234,204,192,216,91,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
