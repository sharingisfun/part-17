Chronicling the sacrifices made by otherwise average people, this keepsake features profiles and interviews with the men and women who responded to the call to action by putting their lives on hold to fight for their country at home and abroad. \n\n\nFrom soldiers and spies to factory workers and nurses, the heroes profiled in this history include Dick Hamada, a Japanese-American who became a spy with the Office of Strategic Services; Edith McClure, an army nurse stationed in England; Bobby Hite, one of the famed Doolittle Raiders, who was captured by the Japanese and endured years of torture and solitary confinement; and pilot Bob Hoover, who was shot down over enemy territory and imprisoned but managed to escape by stealing a German plane.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018da40542afc2a98a74b4e3e2bcb82aa5cbb77e","amp;dn":"Just+Doing+My+Job+-+Stories+of+Service+from+World+War+II+%28Malest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018da40542afc2a98a74b4e3e2bcb82aa5cbb77e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,141,164,5,66,175,194,169,138,116,180,227,226,188,184,42,165,203,183,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
