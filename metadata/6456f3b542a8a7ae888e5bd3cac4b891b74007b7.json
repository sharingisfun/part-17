Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band - Beatles AVCHD DTS5.0 rECOn\n\nSource: DVD-A High resolution 96Khz/24bit MLP lossless audio -&gt; DTS core 96/24 high resolution audio\n\nThe Beatles need no introduction and of course Sgt. Pepper marks what some consider the peak of the Beatles reign over the world of pop music. To this day, you won't find better sound reproduction of the recording in the file sharing realm.  Since the original studio tapes were used in the DVD-A production, the audio has much better depth and realism than any LP to digital conversion.\n\nThe original promotional demonstration hybrid DVD-A/V was rECOnstructed using the high resolution lossless 5.0 channel MLP 96khz/24bit audio which is not playable by 99% of modern Blu-ray or DVD players due to hardware limitations and copy protection issues.  \n\nSince most peeps can't playback DTS-MA, the audio tracks are encoded to DTS-CORE 96khz-24bit lossy high resolution DTS codec to save bandwidth.  Most modern hi-fi receivers can decode this format as high resolution content without down converting but may require some adjustment of the blu-ray player output settings.   The difference in sound quality between the compressed 96/24 DTS and original MLP is barely audible.  Either way, the resulting sound clarity and realism is stunning.  FYI, for some unknown reason, VLC media player does not playback this DTS format.  WMP will playback provided proper codec (ffdshow, etc) is installed.\n\nThe disk is authored as an AVCHD suitable for either BD or DVD / AVCHD media.  Static titles are used for video.  Chapters points are included.  The content easily fits on a standard DVD-R single sided disk.\n\nProduct Details\n\nArtist: Beatles\nVideo format: Titles with chapters\nVideo: H264, uncropped, progressive, 1920 x 1080, 23.976fps\nAudio: English (DTS 5.0 high resolution 96/24)\nCompression: DTS 1536kbps 5.0 channel 96/24 high resolution core\nSubtitles: NA\nRegion: NA\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\nRun Time: 39 minutes 23 seconds\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper%27s_Lonely_Hearts_Club_Band&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAmgCaAFH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAmgCaAFH&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSong List:\n\nSgt.
