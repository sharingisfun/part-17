However it doesn't nearly cover his career and\nall the movies he did. It's full of hyperbole (everything is the\ngreatest and most successful etc) and all the 80s pop music\nis pretty weird. You also never get a real sense of when all\nthis was happening, the only date given is 1983 as the\nshooting year of The Ninja Mission.\nIt's still absolutely worth a watch and then go grab some\nof the mans films and have a good time.\n\nVideo: H264 1280x720 25fps\nAudio: Swedish AAC 48000Hz stereo\nSubtitles: English fansub by myself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2a8b696d80a11f48d2fb6f7301955bb07156d4","amp;dn":"The+Director+Who+Disappeared%2C+The+Story+of+The+Ninja+Mission+%5B72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2a8b696d80a11f48d2fb6f7301955bb07156d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,42,139,105,109,128,161,31,72,210,251,111,115,1,149,91,176,113,86,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
