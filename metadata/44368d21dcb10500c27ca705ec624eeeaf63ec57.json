Smile)\n- Lobby matchmaking system (it really does work but the Steam server will kick you out immediately)\n- Playing on Steam servers (it never will)\n\nNotes:\nCheck for emulator updates at www.rev-cew.info and cs.rin.ru\n\nTesting:\nSkullptura tested -&gt; working\nSteam rip tested -&gt; working\nOther clients -&gt; untested but should work (feel free to try)\n\nCompatibility:\nThis client can connect to v1.0.1.4 servers only.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n- Create a backup of your whole game! (To connect to old servers and in case something goes wrong)\n- Extract the archive to your game directory overwriting everything\n- Open rev.ini in Notepad and edit your player name (!DefaultPlayerName!), leave everything else\n- Rebuild sound cache if needed\n- Play\n\nUninstallation instructions:\n- Delete your game folder\n- Restore your backup Smile\n\nAbout rebuilding the sound cache:\n\nSome versions of the L4D client (e.g. Skullptura) come with re-encoded sound files. This may conflict with the default sound cache of the game and causes poor audio quality and static noise. If you experience this then do the following:\n\nExecute (read: double-click) the &quot;fixaudio.cmd&quot; file in your installation directory\nThe game will start and rebuild the necessary file then it will exit.\n\nAbout the server browser:\n\n- You can open it by typing &quot;openserverbrowser&quot; into the game console or you can bind a key for this command in config.cfg or autoexec.cfg\n- The Setti servers appear on the Custom tab. If you know any L4D servers that do not appear on the list please submit them @ css.setti.info.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44368d21dcb10500c27ca705ec624eeeaf63ec57","amp;dn":"Left+4+Dead+No-Steam+Patch+1.0.1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44368d21dcb10500c27ca705ec624eeeaf63ec57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,54,141,33,220,177,5,0,194,124,167,5,236,98,78,238,175,99,236,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
