The members were guitarists Ryan Dahle and Todd Kerns, bassist John Kerns and drummer Kurt Dahle. Ryan, Todd and Kurt all contributed vocals as well.\n\nAOE were one of the most commercially successful Canadian rock bands of the mid-90s. Their commercial breakthrough came with their independent EP Ugly in 1993, which spawned several hits and set the stage for the major label release of The Age of Electric in 1995.\n\nIn 1996, the Dahle brothers released an album with the side project Limblifter, which was also commercially successful in Canada.\n\nAOE then regrouped for Make a Pest a Pet in 1997, which produced the radio rock hit &quot;Remote Control.&quot; Although the album was a hit, tensions within the band led the group to break up after a 1999 tour as the opening band for Our Lady Peace.\n\nUpon the break-up of Age of Electric, the brothers Kerns would go on to form Static in Stereo with other members including their brother Ryan. Kurt Dahle went on to work with The New Pornographers. \n\n\n\n\nAge of Electric\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nMotor\nBellyup\nUntitled\nGetaway\nEnya\nEpitaph\nOr Whatever\nUgly\nHypocrite\nDecamputate\nQuality Girl\nTestosterone Buildup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake A Pest a Pet \n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n\n1.
