This weight system produced a series of weapons of 3-, 6- and 12-pdr. calibre along with 7- and 10-pdr. howitzers. In the 1780s they were joined by Cavalry artillery guns with their Wurst seats. In 1811 Austria also began the establishment of rocket troops based upon the British invention, whilst their heavy and siege pieces remained the 12 -,18- and 24-pdrs throughout the period. This book describes the system as well as its operational use during the Napoleonic Wars","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd51f7d78960960e2a1f084f067951762709282f","amp;dn":"Austrian+Napoleonic+Artillery+1792-1815","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd51f7d78960960e2a1f084f067951762709282f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,81,247,215,137,96,150,14,42,31,8,79,6,121,81,118,39,9,40,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
