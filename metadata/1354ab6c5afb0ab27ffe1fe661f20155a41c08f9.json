It addresses many process-specific applications includingthose on fired heaters, compressors and distillation columns.\n\nWritten with the practicing control engineer in mind, thebook: * Brings together proven design methods, many of which have neverbeen published before * Focuses on techniques that have an immediate practicalapplication * Minimizes the use of daunting mathematics but for themore demanding reader, complex mathematical derivations areincluded at the end of each chapter * Covers the use of all the algorithms, common to mostdistributed control systems\n\nThis book raises the standard of what might be expected of evenbasic controls. In addition to the design methods it describesany shortcuts that can be taken and how to avoid common pitfalls.Proper application will result in significant improvements toprocess performance.\n\nMyke King's practical approach addresses the needs of the process industry, and will improve the working practices of many control engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1354ab6c5afb0ab27ffe1fe661f20155a41c08f9","amp;dn":"Process+Control+A+Practical+Approach+-+Myke+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1354ab6c5afb0ab27ffe1fe661f20155a41c08f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,84,171,108,90,251,10,178,127,254,31,230,97,242,1,85,164,28,8,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
