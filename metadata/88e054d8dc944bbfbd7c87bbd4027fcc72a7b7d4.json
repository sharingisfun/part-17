Though dated, it answers the questions &quot;Why are U.S. unions so weak?&quot; and &quot;Why is U.S. union membership so low?&quot; It also details the mentally and morally unhealthy lifestyle associated with the author's work, and his personal degradation into alcohol abuse, dysfunctional relationships, and white-collar crime. And, finally, the book describes the &quot;true colors&quot; - that is, the attitudes, outlooks, motivations, actions, schemes, and true nature - of those who run a wide variety of companies, and don't want unions.\n\nThe book is difficult to obtain, thus this distribution. The text from the book is presented here in its entirety (except for the index) in three formats - HTML, PDF, and Kindle. The text has been checked for errors but it's likely that some remain; therefore the scanned pages from the book are also included, for reference.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e054d8dc944bbfbd7c87bbd4027fcc72a7b7d4","amp;dn":"Confessions+of+a+Union+Buster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e054d8dc944bbfbd7c87bbd4027fcc72a7b7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,224,84,216,220,148,75,191,189,124,135,187,212,2,127,204,114,167,183,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
