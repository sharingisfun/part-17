In place of the genial polymath, self-improver, and quintessential American, Gordon S. Wood reveals a figure much more ambiguous and complexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and much more interesting. Charting the passage of FranklinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life and reputation from relative popular indifference (his death, while the occasion for mass mourning in France, was widely ignored in America) to posthumous glory, The Americanization of Benjamin Franklin sheds invaluable light on the emergence of our countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s idea of itself.\n\n\n# Paperback: 320 pages\n# Publisher: Penguin (Non-Classics) (May 31, 2005)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0143035282\n# ISBN-13: 978-0143035282","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb83db91af68df884d72ef4af81f188bc196139","amp;dn":"The+Americanization+of+Benjamin+Franklin+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb83db91af68df884d72ef4af81f188bc196139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,184,61,185,26,246,141,248,132,215,46,244,175,129,241,136,188,25,97,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
