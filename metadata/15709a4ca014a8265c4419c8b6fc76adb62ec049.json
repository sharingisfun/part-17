His mystical belief that this empire would last a 1000 years proved unfounded, but not before a world war which resulted in the loss of at least 60 million lives. This atlas charts the rise and fall of Hitler's Nazi state, from the first mass meeting of the NSDAP in Munich in 1920, through the relentless territorial aggression and anti-Jewish atrocities of World War II, to the execution of war criminals in Nuremburg in 1946. It offers insights into the seemingly inexorable rise of National Socialism and examines the nature of Hitler's power structures both within his party and within Germany as a whole","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15709a4ca014a8265c4419c8b6fc76adb62ec049","amp;dn":"Historical+Atlas+of+the+Third+Reich+%28Penguin%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15709a4ca014a8265c4419c8b6fc76adb62ec049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,112,154,76,160,20,168,38,92,68,25,200,182,252,118,173,182,46,192,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
