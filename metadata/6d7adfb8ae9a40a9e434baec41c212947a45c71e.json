The installation is now going straight to the image, anyone can record on DVD.\n\nWhereas previously there were previous versions use AltiumUninstaller.exe, just might have to hand delete the file C:\\Users\\User_Name\\AppData\\Local\\Altium\\ AltiumInstaller.ini - in Win7, in WinXP you must remove the same file AltiumInstaller.ini, location of a similar, but for XP - a descent can not remember, use the search file. If AltiumInstaller.ini not to remove, then reinstall to begin with the former place.\n\nP.P.S.
