The soldiers of the 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions speak of segregation in the military and racial attitudes in army facilities stateside and abroad. The individual battles of black soldiers reveal a compelling tale of discrimination, triumph, resistance, and camaraderie. What emerges from the multitude of voices is a complex and powerful story of individuals who served their country and subsequently made demands to be recognized as full-fledged citizens.\n\nMorehouse, whose father served in the 93rd Infantry Division, has built a rich historical account around personal interviews and correspondence with soldiers, National Archive documents, and military archive materials. Augmented with historical and recent photographs, Fighting in the Jim Crow Army combines individual recollections with official histories to form a vivid picture of life in the segregated Army.\n\nIn the historiography of World War II very little has emerged from the perspective of the black foot soldier. Morehouse allows the participants to tell the tale of the watershed event of their participation in World War II as well as the ongoing black freedom struggle.\n\n\nPaperback: 272 pages\nPublisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers (December 28, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0742548058\nISBN-13: 978-0742548053\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Jim-Crow-Army-Remember/dp/0742548058/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372554576&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Fighting+in+the+Jim+Crow+Army%3A+black+men+and+women+remember+World+War+II&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Jim-Crow-Army-Remember/dp/0742548058/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372554576&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Fighting+in+the+Jim+Crow+Army%3A+black+men+and+women+remember+World+War+II&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67013c93aa239bb6d1096c3af1846e50b779f46","amp;dn":"%09Fighting+in+the+Jim+Crow+Army%3A+black+men+and+women+remember+Wor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67013c93aa239bb6d1096c3af1846e50b779f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,112,19,201,58,162,57,187,109,16,150,195,175,24,70,229,11,119,159,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
