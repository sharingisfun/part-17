There are many zombies in Uranus. The old ones are the bestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThe team has the comedy horror balance in favour of playing it for laughs but prat-falling zombies are complemented by a nice wit- essayed through Frank and the great single player narrative.\n\nDead Rising 2 off the Record: Sandbox\n\nAs well as co op online and a continued narrative in single player mode, it was the new Sandbox that we enjoyed. Taking us off rails, we were allowed to run around Fortune City without time constraints and just follow challenges that can be picked up as you go.\n\nDead Rising 2 off the Record: Features\n\nWe were taking in to new safe spots where Frank can combo weapons as you would in any RPG. But the incessantly innovative fun keeps the gameplay fresh because there are so many ways to dole out zombie take-downs it just doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get boring. As well as weapons update, psychos are back and there are new vehicles and items to pick up.\n\n\nWAIT FOR CRACK...WAIT FOR CRACK...WAIT FOR CRACK...WAIT FOR CRACK...\n\nWHEN CRACK IS OUT I WILL BE POST IT UP.\n\n\nINSTALL PROOF:\n\n[http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1116/imagen2hb.jpg]\n\n[http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/8377/sinttulowwwc.png]\n\n\nFILE PROOF:\n\n[http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/3058/sinttulofgt.png]\n\n[http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/5281/sinttulogj.png]\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117a89af13efd6bf62a81a3463107dcdcb3d2c59","amp;dn":"Dead+Rising+2+Off+The+Record+WAIT+FOR+CRACK...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117a89af13efd6bf62a81a3463107dcdcb3d2c59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,122,137,175,19,239,214,191,98,168,26,52,99,16,125,205,203,61,44,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
