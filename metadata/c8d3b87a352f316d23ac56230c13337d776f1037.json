He is one of \nthree noted guitarists to have played with The Yardbirds; (Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page are \nthe other two). Beck also formed The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert &amp; Appice.\n\nMuch of Becks recorded output has been instrumental, with a focus on innovative sound and \nhis releases have spanned genres ranging from blues-rock, heavy metal, jazz fusion and an \nadditional blend of guitar-rock and electronica. Although he recorded two hit albums \n(in 1975 and 1976) as a solo act, Beck has not established or maintained the sustained \ncommercial success of many of his contemporaries and bandmates. Beck appears on albums \nby Mick Jagger, Kate Bush, Roger Waters, Donovan, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Zucchero, \nCyndi Lauper, Brian May and ZZ Top. In 1988, he made a cameo appearance in the movie Twins..\n\n\n   1. Jeff Beck - Led Boots                                   [04:08]\n   2.
