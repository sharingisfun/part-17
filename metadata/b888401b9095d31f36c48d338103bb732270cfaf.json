It's almost like a 60s rock star reunion celtic style with a few 'newer' voices thrown into the mix.  What can you say when Marianne Faithfull, Mick Jagger, Van Morrisson, Tom Jones, Sinead O'Connor plus others, get together with the legendary Chieftains?  WOW!!!  is what I say.\n\nRipped to flac from the disc using EAC.  Covers, cue sheet, and playlist are included.\n\n\nFor more on flac:\nxs.vc/eac/index.html\nsourceforge.net\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n\n\n01.
