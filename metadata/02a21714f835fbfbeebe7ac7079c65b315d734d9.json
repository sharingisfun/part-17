Teamed in a sextet with trumpeter Webster Young (also making his recording debut), altoist Jackie McLean, pianist Mal Waldron, bassist Spanky DeBrest, and drummer Ben Dixon, Draper fits in pretty well. His solos are sometimes a touch awkward rhythmically and it takes one a little while to get used to his sound in this setting but, overall, this is a successful effort. The fairly modern sextet performs straight-ahead originals by Draper, Young, and Waldron in addition to the standard &quot;You're My Thrill.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Terry Anne\n02 - Your My Thrill\n03 - Pivot\n04 - Jackie's Dolly\n05 - Minnie's Interlude\n06 - House of Davis\n\nEnjoy and share!
