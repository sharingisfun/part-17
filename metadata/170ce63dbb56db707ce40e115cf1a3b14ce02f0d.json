Not only have traditional forms of art such as printing, painting, photography and sculpture been transformed by digital techniques and media, but entirely new forms such as net art, software art, digital installation and virtual reality have emerged as recognized artistic practices, collected by major museums, institutions and private collectors the world over. Here Christiane Paul surveys the developments in digital art from its appearance in the early 1990s right up to the present day, and looks ahead to what the future may hold. Drawing a distinction between work that uses digital technology as a tool to produce traditional forms and work that uses it as a medium to create new types of art, she discusses all the key artists and works. The book explores themes addressed and raised by the art, such as viewer interaction, artificial life and intelligence, political and social activism, networks and telepresence, as well as issues such as the collection, presentation and preservation of digital art, the virtual museum, and ownership and copyright","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170ce63dbb56db707ce40e115cf1a3b14ce02f0d","amp;dn":"Digital+Art+%28World+of+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170ce63dbb56db707ce40e115cf1a3b14ce02f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,12,230,61,187,86,219,112,124,228,14,17,92,241,163,177,76,224,47,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
