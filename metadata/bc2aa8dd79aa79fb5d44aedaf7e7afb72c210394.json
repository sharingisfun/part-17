We'll kick things off by breaking down letterforms and learning about their different components. We'll then learn the difference between a typeface, a typestyle and a type family. Next we'll unravel the mystery of how type is measured through points and picas. Then we'll move on and learn about line spacing, letter spacing and word spacing. From there, we'll learn about working with large bodies of type and discuss different methods of alignment. Finally, we'll learn about the process of choosing and using a typeface.\n\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2aa8dd79aa79fb5d44aedaf7e7afb72c210394","amp;dn":"Non+Lynda+%7C+DT+-+Fundamentals+of+Typography+with+Eddie+Russell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2aa8dd79aa79fb5d44aedaf7e7afb72c210394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,42,168,221,121,170,121,251,93,68,174,218,247,231,175,183,44,33,3,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
