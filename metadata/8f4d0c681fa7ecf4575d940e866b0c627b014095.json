As the title suggests Robert works with and models a famous US healer Judie B. McReynolds. It is also a wonderful opportunity to see an expert healer at work, explaining how she works. The tapes are almost four hours in length and cover the following subject areas: Modeler &amp; Healer, NLP Modeling Processes, Sharing a Healing, Initiating a Healing Process, Macro Modeling - Sharing a Healing, Macro Modeling - Initiating a Healing Process, NLP Modeling Processes - Review, Micro Modeling - Scanning, Applying - The Micro Modeled Process. Robert Dilts and Judy Mack Reynolds conducting a joint seminar on modeling of healing. Judy serves kachetve model and Robert demonstrates modeling skills. I think it will be interesting to anyone who wants-going-already-has become a master of NLP, as well as all the rest in English, without subtitles! \n\nQuality : VHSRip \nFormat : AVI \nVideo codec : DivX \nAudio codec : MP3 \nVideo : 352x256 650 kbps \nAudio : 128 kpbs cbr ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f4d0c681fa7ecf4575d940e866b0c627b014095","amp;dn":"Masters+at+work%3A+Robert+Dilts+%28Robert+Dilts%29+-+Modeling+A+Healer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f4d0c681fa7ecf4575d940e866b0c627b014095","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,77,12,104,31,167,236,244,87,93,148,14,134,107,12,98,123,1,64,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
