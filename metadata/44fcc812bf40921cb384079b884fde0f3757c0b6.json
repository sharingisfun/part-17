It is a fine addition to what promises to be an outstanding series on the world's great monuments.' Martin Gayford, Sunday Telegraph 'Entrancing ... an excellent guide, full of fascinating characters and juicy anecdotes ... Having been to the Alhambra many times, after reading this wonderful book I wished to go back - and see it for the first time.' Susha Guppy, Independent 'For those who know his work, it will confirm his genius and to others it will act as an excellent introduction' Martin Bright, Observer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44fcc812bf40921cb384079b884fde0f3757c0b6","amp;dn":"Wonders+of+the+World+-+The+Alhambra+%28Architecture+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44fcc812bf40921cb384079b884fde0f3757c0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,252,200,18,191,64,146,28,179,132,7,155,136,79,222,15,55,87,192,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
