Since releasing his first hit song, &quot;Piano Man&quot;, in 1973, Joel has become the sixth best-selling recording artist and the third best-selling solo artist in the United States, according to the RIAA.[2]\n\nJoel had Top 40 hits in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; achieving 33 Top 40 hits in the United States, all of which he wrote singlehandedly. He is also a six-time Grammy Award winner, a 23-time Grammy nominee and has sold over 150 million records worldwide.[3] He was inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006) and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame (2009). Joel &quot;retired&quot; from recording pop music in 1993 but continues to tour (often with Elton John).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2000 Years: The Millennium Concert 2000\n\n\n2000 Years: The Millennium Concert is a two-disc set and the third live album by Billy Joel, released in 2000.\n\nThe album was recorded on New Year's Eve 1999 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though some alterations were made before its release: some songs are not the same version featured in the original concert (like &quot;Big Shot&quot;)[citation needed], others were edited in studio (some YouTube videos of &quot;Scenes From An Italian Restaurant&quot; show Billy singing offkey, while he sings perfectly on the album). 2000 Years: The Millennium Concert also marked the first time several songs had to be transposed to lower keys to accommodate Joel's deepening voice (&quot;I Go To Extremes&quot;, &quot;I've Loved These Days&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot; and &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot; are in the key of BÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€žÂ¢Ã‚Â­ vs. C).\n\nSome versions of the album that were released out of the United States are basically a compilation of moments from the concert[citation needed] with two bonus tracks: &quot;This Is The Time&quot; (live from the concert) and &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; (live from the concert (Japan release Only)).\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Beethoven's Ninth Symphony&quot; (Beethoven) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:43\n2.\t&quot;Big Shot&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n3.\t&quot;Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n4.\t&quot;Summer, Highland Falls&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n5.\t&quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:52\n6.\t&quot;Don't Ask Me Why&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n7.\t&quot;New York State of Mind&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:29\n8.\t&quot;I've Loved These Days&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n9.\t&quot;My Life&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47\n10.\t&quot;Allentown&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n11.\t&quot;Prelude/Angry Young Man&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:23\n12.\t&quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\t&quot;I Go to Extremes&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n2.\t&quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:28\n3.\t&quot;We Didn't Start the Fire&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n4.\t&quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:29\n5.\t&quot;2000 Years&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02\n6.\t&quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; (Burns/Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:44\n7.\t&quot;The River of Dreams&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:54\n8.\t&quot;Scenes from an Italian Restaurant&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:05\n9.\t&quot;Dance to the Music&quot; (Stewart) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n10.\t&quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n11.\t&quot;It's Still Rock &amp; Roll to Me&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n12.\t&quot;You May Be Right&quot; (Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:07\n13.\t&quot;This Night&quot; (Beethoven/Joel) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:49\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501f39a67ba482a6c0d7cedba3d95ead42d65154","amp;dn":"Billy+Joel+-+2000+Years+Millennium+Concert+2000+%5BFLAC%5D+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501f39a67ba482a6c0d7cedba3d95ead42d65154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,31,57,166,123,164,130,166,192,215,206,219,163,217,94,173,66,214,81,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
