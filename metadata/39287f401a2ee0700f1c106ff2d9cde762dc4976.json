It is no longer important how many releases you do.\n            It's more important which ass you are going to kiss... if you kiss the right place, doors will open for you!\n            Even when you are inactive, numbers don't matter, just kiss more ass!\n            Quality or quantity? Quality and quantity, all people have different taste so the quality is also different everyone!\n            Our team members are releasing in 5 different groups but you only write nfos about -YOU.\n            If you believe we care, we don't. We know we are successful because if we weren't, you wouldn't be writing about us!\n            If some group does a better job then you they must be linked with p2p... are you serious? Where is it written that you can't\n            have your own source and you have to show the receipt for every release you pre? We don't see cd groups being asked to show a receipt for\n            every cd that pre, so...\n            I can show you receipts, but why would I reveal my source? Fight with the unknown\n            Btw, we were not kicked from the site maximum, we left... so if you are a site op and you believe these ridiculous claims made by jealous ppl just delete us m            To all the other haters, YOU-can-SUCK-OUR-DICK.\n            To all the other haters, YOU-can-SUCK-OUR-DICK.\n\n                        Greets??.:\n                        BPM CBR TALiON VOICE WAX\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39287f401a2ee0700f1c106ff2d9cde762dc4976","amp;dn":"Skrillex_Alvin_Risk-Try_It_Out-%28075679946645%29-WEB-2013-YOU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39287f401a2ee0700f1c106ff2d9cde762dc4976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,40,127,64,26,46,224,112,15,28,16,111,242,217,205,231,98,220,73,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
