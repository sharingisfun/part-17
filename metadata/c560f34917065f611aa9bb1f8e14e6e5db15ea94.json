Harpo, along with Lightnin' Slim, Lazy Lester, Lonesome Sundown, and a dozen other downhome artists, recorded for A&amp;R man J.D. Miller in Crowley, Louisiana. The records were then issued on the Excello label, based in Nashville.\n\nHarpo's relaxed, almost lazy, performances set the tone for his subsequent work. His warm, languid voice enhanced the sexual metaphor of &quot;I'm A King Bee&quot;, which was later recorded by the Rolling Stones. The Rolling Stones also covered the pulsating &quot;Shake Your Hips&quot;, which Harpo first issued in 1966, while the Pretty Things, the Yardbirds and Them featured versions of his songs in their early repertoires. Later, the riff from Harpo's hit &quot;Shake Your Hips&quot; was used in the ZZ Top hit &quot;La Grange,&quot; and the Rolling Stones covered the song on their 1972 album, Exile On Main Street. Harpo enjoyed a notable US Top 20 pop hit in 1966 with &quot;Baby Scratch My Back&quot; (also a number 1 R&amp;B hit), which revitalized his career. Never a full-time musician, Harpo had his own trucking business during the 1960s, although he was a popular figure in the late 1960s blues revival, with appearances at several renowned venues including the Electric Circus and the Fillmore East. \n\nFiles in this torrent:\n\n01.
