The group built up a loyal following touring \nthe Southeast. They self-produced their first album even though they still \nhad not landed a record deal. A song titled &quot;New Age Girl&quot; off of this self-\npublished record became popular regionally and earned airplay in New \nOrleans and Atlanta. After receiving this airplay, the band landed a record \ndeal with the independent label Ichiban Records. Ichiban released the group's \ndebut album A Different Story in 1994. After its release, the song &quot;New Age \nGirl&quot; was selected for inclusion on the Dumb and Dumber feature film \nsoundtrack. The publicity from the film caused the song to become a national \nhit, peaking at #27 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March, 1995. The band \nreleased their second album, Whirl, in 1995 but were unable to reproduce the \nsuccess produced by &quot;New Age Girl&quot;. Deadeye Dick later disbanded. Caleb \nGuillotte and Mark Miller continue to remain active in the local New Orleans \nmusic scene as producers.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com ::","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a50bab70da3e59f28946cdbcf8084e3755ea375","amp;dn":"Deadeye+Dick+-+A+Different+Story+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a50bab70da3e59f28946cdbcf8084e3755ea375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,80,186,183,13,163,229,159,40,148,108,219,207,128,132,227,117,94,163,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
