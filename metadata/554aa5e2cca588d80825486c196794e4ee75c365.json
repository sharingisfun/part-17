Robin Blackburn exposes the perverse reasoning and special interests which have combined to produce this nonsensical state of affairs.\n\nThis updated paperback edition of Age Shock includes a new preface explaining why the credit crunch and eurozone crisis have had such a devastating impact and outlining a way to guarantee decent pensions and care provision.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:554aa5e2cca588d80825486c196794e4ee75c365","amp;dn":"Age+Shock%3A+How+Finance+is+Failing+Us+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"554aa5e2cca588d80825486c196794e4ee75c365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,74,165,226,204,165,136,216,8,37,72,108,25,103,148,228,238,117,195,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
