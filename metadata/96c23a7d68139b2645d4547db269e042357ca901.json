It's all I could find on the net, but it was hard to find so I thought I would upload it here. If anybody has a good audio editor and splits it into different tracks, please let me know. In addition to that, if anyone can find me some Dead Man's Party (The tribute band, not the album, I already have that...) or the album Dead Band's Party (The OB Tribute album) PLEASE let me know.\n\nJust hit 32 times I've seeded this out. Never expected it to get that much. &lt;2/18/09\n\nI have to show Grungii some love on here! He has created a most awesome discography of Oingo Boingo, and it looks pretty damn complete to me!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4715064/Oingo_Boingo_-_Discography_(Everything)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4715064/Oingo_Boingo_-_Discography_(Everything)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                                ^2/19/09^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c23a7d68139b2645d4547db269e042357ca901","amp;dn":"Oingo+Boingo+-+Farewell+Mp4%2C+Mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c23a7d68139b2645d4547db269e042357ca901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,194,58,125,104,19,155,38,69,212,84,125,178,105,224,66,53,124,169,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
