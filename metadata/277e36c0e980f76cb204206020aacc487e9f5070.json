After spending several days with an iPhone 5 equipped with the latest update, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now time to take a final look at how iOS 6.1.2 performs on AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most current iPhone, the iPhone 4.\nIn late January, after weeks of waiting, iPhone, iPad and iPod touch owners were graced with their first major update to the iOS 6 operating system that Apple debuted in June at WWDC and released several months later in the fall of 2012. While there had been incremental bug fixes in between, as is customary for Apple, iOS 6.1 represented the first update that actually brought along some new features\nHowever, as many owners also learned, the update also brought along several menacing bugs that made lives miserable for those that installed the update.\n\niPhone 4S owners who installed the update were kindly greeted with 3G connectivity issue that Apple quickly fixed with its first iOS 6.1 update, iOS 6.1.1, which was an update that the company had to rush out in order to quell the issue. This 3G bug was not the only major issue that arrived with iOS 6.1 though.\n\nIn addition to it, owners of the iPhone and iPad were also greeted with an Exchange issue within the calendar that caused increased network activity leading to abnormal battery drain. Those who have an Exchange email on their iPhone, a group that includes workers at small and large businesses, likely encountered the issue.\n\nLike it did with the 3G connectivity issues, Apple move quickly to solve the Exchange bug. On Tuesday, the company issued the second update to iOS 6.1 since January in the form of iOS 6.1.2.\n\nAnd while the update was aimed at solving the Exchange issue, as many iPhone and iPad owners know, these updates can sometimes bring about instability or other issues.\n\nWe already offered our first impressions of the iOS 6.1.2 update on the iPhone 5 and now, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to take a final look at the iOS 6.1.2 update on the iPhone 4 and whether or not itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth installing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:277e36c0e980f76cb204206020aacc487e9f5070","amp;dn":"Iphone+4+IOS+6.1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"277e36c0e980f76cb204206020aacc487e9f5070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,126,54,192,233,128,247,108,178,4,32,96,32,170,204,72,126,159,80,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
