Tim Eriksen is one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more fearless performers: long admired as a singer, steeped in Americana and particularly the eerie northern New England tradition, the multi-instrumentalist is no stranger to singing a-cappella. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most impressive is how this album was made: Eriksen sang all fourteen songs solo with neither band nor instrumentation, in a single take, in a tower along the wall of the Benedictine Abbey in Jaroslaw, Poland. His slightly twangy baritone is a potent instrument, but he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overdo it: this is an album of interpretations, a voice alone setting and maintaining a mood with the lyrics. Yet it also doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t offer the impression that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s holding anything in reserve, waiting til the end when he knows he can empty the tank and blow out his voice if he wants. And what technique! Eriksen is pitch-perfect, working those blue notes with a sorcererÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subtlety. Tenacity in the face of hardship, mourning and even gruesomeness is the feeling that links most of the often centuries-old songs here: many of them, even a hymn like Son of God, are absolutely macabre. Most of them are in minor keys; and to EriksenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s credit, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sing them all in the same key. The tension lets up a little at the end of the English folk song Gallows Tree, where the prisoner at the end of the rope is finally rescued as the hangman is paid his bribe (for another, absolutely lights-out solo vocal performance of this song, check out the version on Robin OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢BrienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album The Apple in Man).\n\nBy contrast, Eriksen gives the narrator of Drowsy Sleeper Ã¢â‚¬â€œ dying of food poisoning Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a chance to make a forceful last stand. He works segues between several of the songs so seamlessly that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to tell when one ends and another begins. A couple of them are traditionally sung by women, but Eriksen pulls them off, notably the ominously gleeful A Soldier Traveling from the North, where the girl begs the traveling soldier not to leave (the implication is that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pregnant). Eriksen recasts Amazing Grace as rustic Appalachian folk, and finally lets the clouds dissipate with a rousing, revival camp-style version of Better Days Coming to end the album. This ought to appeal to a wide audience, from fans of groups like the Handsome Family to otherworldly Balkan-Applachian singers \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dde74688a0540c966e92783c606b1cec5f8dd50","amp;dn":"Tim+Eriksen...Soul+of+the+January+Hills%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dde74688a0540c966e92783c606b1cec5f8dd50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,222,116,104,138,5,64,201,102,233,39,131,198,6,177,206,197,248,221,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
