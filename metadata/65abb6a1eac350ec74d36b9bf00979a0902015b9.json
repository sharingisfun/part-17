Many of the Housemartins' lyrics were a mixture of Marxist politics and Christianity, reflecting singer Paul Heaton's beliefs at the time (the back cover of London 0 Hull 4 contained the message, &quot;Take Jesus - Take Marx - Take Hope&quot;).\nThe band was formed in 1983 by Paul Heaton (vocals) and Stan Cullimore (guitar) who initially performed as a busking duo. They then expanded by recruiting Ted Key (bass), former guitarist with The Gargoyles, and Dodger (drummer on loan from 3-Action!) who was then replaced by Chris Lang. The band's membership changed considerably over the years. Ted Key left at the end of 1985 and was replaced by Norman Cook ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the future Fatboy Slim ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and drummer Chris Lang was replaced by Hugh Whitaker, former drummer with The Gargoyles, who in turn was replaced with Dave Hemingway.\nThe band often referred to themselves as &quot;the 4th best band in Hull&quot;, referring to Hull, the city in England where the band formed in 1983. (The three bands that were &quot;better&quot; were Red Guitars, 3-Action!, and The Gargoyles).\nIn 1986, having recorded two John Peel sessions, the band broke through with the single &quot;Happy Hour&quot;, which reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart. The single's success was helped by a claymation animated pop promo of a type that was in vogue at the time, featuring a cameo by television comedian Phill Jupitus, who toured with the band under his stage name of 'Porky the Poet'.\nAt the end of 1986 they got their only UK #1 single on 16 December with a cover version of Isley Jasper Isley's &quot;Caravan of Love.&quot; It was knocked off the top spot by Jackie Wilson's &quot;Reet Petite&quot; on 23 December, denying the band the coveted Christmas #1 single.\nThe a cappella style of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; was not to the taste of all Housemartins fans and was even derided by some as a sell-out. However, a cappella material had always been part of the band's repertoire. &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; was first performed by the band in their second John Peel session in April 1986, prior to their initial chart success. At Peel's suggestion, the band then recorded another session (under the name The Fish City Five) consisting entirely of a cappella performances, and on at least one occasion played support act for their own performance under this alternative name. The &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; single featured four a cappella gospel songs on the B-side.\nThe band split in 1988, but the members have since remained friends and worked on each other's projects. Norman Cook has enjoyed significant success with both Beats International and then as Fatboy Slim, while Heaton, Hemingway and roadie Sean Welch formed The Beautiful South. Despite repeated requests from fans, they have never reformed.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65abb6a1eac350ec74d36b9bf00979a0902015b9","amp;dn":"The+Housemartins-5+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65abb6a1eac350ec74d36b9bf00979a0902015b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,171,182,161,234,195,80,236,116,211,107,155,240,9,121,160,144,32,21,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
