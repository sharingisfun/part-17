Governments went down in Guatemala and Iran thanks to you. In distant Indonesia, Laos, and Vietnam, what a role you played! And even that botch-up of an invasion in Cuba was nothing to sneeze at. In those days, unfortunately, youÃ¢â‚¬â€œparticularly those of you in the CIAÃ¢â‚¬â€œdidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the credit you deserved.\n\nYou had to live privately with your successes. Sometimes, as with the Bay of Pigs, the failures came back to haunt you (so, in the case of Iran, would your Ã¢â‚¬Å“success,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ though so many years later), but you couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t with pride talk publicly about what you, in your secret world, had done, or see instant movies and TV shows about your triumphs. You couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t launch a Ã¢â‚¬Å“covertÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ air war that was reported on, generally positively, almost every week, or bask in the pleasure of having your director claim publicly that it was Ã¢â‚¬Å“the only game in town.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ You couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, that is, come out of what were then called Ã¢â‚¬Å“the shadows,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and soak up the glow of attention, be hailed as a hero, join Americans in watching some (fantasy) version of your efforts weekly on television, or get the credit for anything.\n\nNothing like that was possibleÃ¢â‚¬â€œnot at least until well after two journalists, David Wise and Thomas B. Ross, shined a bright light into those shadows, called you part of an Ã¢â‚¬Å“invisible government,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and outed you in ways that you found deeply discomforting.\n\nTheir book with that startling title, The Invisible Government, was published in 1964 and it was groundbreaking, shadow-removing, illuminating. It caused a fuss from its very first paragraph, which was then a shockeroo: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are two governments in the United States today. One is visible. The other is invisible.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-invisible-government-revealed/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-invisible-government-revealed/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe OUL did a careful OCR scan for this PDF.
