Have you been sticking to your old favorite because you never had time to really see what the other browsers had to offer? Does your current browser have advanced security options? Does it sync your settings across devices? Can you manage your tabs easily? These are all things Firefox can do for you, and you can find out more in this Firefox guide, the latest manual from MakeUseOf.\n\n\nWeb browsers keep evolving to offer features, speed and web standards support. There are many web browsers in the market and because they refuse to sit still many people are confused about which one is the best for them. Most people focus on and look at one concern in the web browser, which is speed. Speed is all very good but it is simply one concern among many. So what are these concerns? And why should you read this manual about Firefox? Before we go any further with this Firefox guide, let us start with some background about Firefox.\n\nFirst of all, in case you didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know, a Web Browser is a program that enables the user to view web pages. Mozilla Firefox is a free, open-source, cross-platform web browser coordinated by Mozilla Corporation. It is the third most widely used web browser, with approximately 24% of worldwide market share (as announced in July 2012). Firefox is a successor to the Netscape Navigator web browser, which was the dominant browser before Microsoft came up with Internet Explorer. Mozilla started when Netscape released the source code of its browser under an open source license; Firefox was released in 2004 (for more information about Firefox history, please see this link). Firefox was designed and developed based on the concept and point of view of building a better Internet by providing the users with what they need, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speed or security (to learn more about how the Mozilla team are making the web better for you, please see this page). Actually, Firefox was the first to implement the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do Not TrackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feature, in addition to other security features.\n\nIn simple words, Firefox is a fast, flexible and secure web browser that helped revolutionize the way people browse the web. So donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get left behind: get your copy now.\n\nIn this Firefox guide, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find out what makes Firefox different, what kind of features it gives you, and why you have to change your mind and start browsing the web with it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d53b686ba76ecf8020e3357e69706a06755cd08","amp;dn":"Tackling+Firefox+-+The+Unofficial+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d53b686ba76ecf8020e3357e69706a06755cd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,83,182,134,186,118,236,248,2,14,51,87,230,151,6,160,103,85,205,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
