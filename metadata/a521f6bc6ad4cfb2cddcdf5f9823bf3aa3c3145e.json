Here is an ideal handbook for chemical, environmental, and civil engineers, and others concerned with the regulatory issues of ASTs. Sections examine various types of storage media and their applications; fundamental environmental engineering concerns; how to select the right industrial codes and standards for the tank; design considerations for ASTs; the construction, fabrication, and erection of tanks; and the requirements designed to keep ASTs environmentally sound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a521f6bc6ad4cfb2cddcdf5f9823bf3aa3c3145e","amp;dn":"Aboveground+Storage+Tanks+-+Philip+E.+Myers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a521f6bc6ad4cfb2cddcdf5f9823bf3aa3c3145e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,33,246,188,106,212,207,178,205,220,223,95,152,35,191,58,163,195,20,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
