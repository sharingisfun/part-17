With these    :\n : changes in technology and the ways it was used came a need to protect both :\n : the systems and the information. For the next ten years, encryption systems:\n : of varying strengths were developed, but none proved to be rigorous enough.:\n : In 1973, the NBS put out an open call for a new, stronger encryption system:\n : that would become the new federal standard. Several years later, IBM       :\n : responded with a system called Lucifer that came to simply be known as DES :\n : (data encryption standard).                                                :\n :                                                                            :\n : The strength of an encryption system is best measured by the attacks it is :\n : able to withstand, and because DES was the federal standard, many tried to :\n : test its limits. (It should also be noted that a number of cryptographers  :\n : and computer scientists told the NSA that DES was not nearly strong enough :\n : and would be easily hacked.) Rogue hackers, usually out to steal as much   :\n : information as possible, tried to break DES. A number of &quot;white hat&quot;       :\n : hackers also tested the system and reported on their successes. Still      :\n : others attacked DES because they believed it had outlived its effectiveness:\n : and was becoming increasingly vulnerable. The sum total of these efforts to:\n : use all of the possible keys to break DES over time made for a brute force :\n : attack.                                                                    :\n :                                                                            :\n : In 1996, the supposedly uncrackable DES was broken. In this captivating and:\n : intriguing book, Matt Curtin charts DES's rise and fall and chronicles the :\n : efforts of those who were determined to master it.                         :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae030307fb227e84a18213241c002d1ef10f43f","amp;dn":"Cracking+the+Data+Encryption+Standard+2013+Retail+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae030307fb227e84a18213241c002d1ef10f43f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,224,48,48,127,178,39,232,74,24,33,50,65,192,2,209,239,16,244,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
