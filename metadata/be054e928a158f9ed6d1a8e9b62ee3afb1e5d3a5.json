The SRC label, home to friend Rihanna, offered a contract, which prompted her to put her studies behind to focus on a music career. Shontelligence, her debut album, was released in November 2008 and stalled out of the gate, despite input from the likes of Stargate. It was given a second push the following February. The album peaked at number 24 on Billboard's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart; somewhat surprisingly, for being such a pop-oriented album, it failed to appear on the Billboard 200 chart. She had greater success with the lead single to her second album. The regretful breakup song &quot;Impossible,&quot; a preview of her second album, was released in February 2010 and hit the Top 20 of the Hot 100 by July. No Gravity was released in September.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal Motown\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.T-Shirt\n02.Battle Cry\n03.Superwoman\n04.Cold Cold Summer\n05.Roll It\n06.Life Is Not An Easy Road\n07.Focus Pon Me\n08.Plastic People\n09.I Crave You\n10.Ghetto Lullabye\n11.Flesh And Bone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                        ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be054e928a158f9ed6d1a8e9b62ee3afb1e5d3a5","amp;dn":"Shontelle+-+Shontelligence+%282008%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be054e928a158f9ed6d1a8e9b62ee3afb1e5d3a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,5,78,146,138,21,143,158,214,209,168,233,182,46,227,175,177,229,211,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
