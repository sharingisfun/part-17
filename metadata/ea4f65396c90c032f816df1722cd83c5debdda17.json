Probably because of the demise of TVS, it's never had a commercial release in the UK, on either VHS or DVD. In the US, it had a very poor quality VHS release on the Kultur label in the 1990s. More recently it's had an institutional/educational release on DVD. The series was also accompanied by a book of the same title.\n\n\nEpisode info:\n\nThe original TVS broadcasts were in an 18 episode x 30 minute format. The American version has each pair of half hour episodes spliced together into a 9 episode x 1 hour format.\n\n\nEpisode 1 - The Classical Ideal\nEpisode 2 - A White Garment of Churches\nEpisode 3 - The Early Renaissance\nEpisode 4 - The High Renaissance\nEpisode 5 - Realms of Light: The Baroque\nEpisode 6 - An Age of Reason, An Age of Passion\nEpisode 7 - Impressionism and Post-Impressionism\nEpisode 8 - Into the Twentieth Century\nEpisode 9 - In Our Own Time\n\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pohrani.com/f/d/lM/3ACXkqq3/artofthewesternworld1989.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pohrani.com/f/d/lM/3ACXkqq3/artofthewesternworld1989.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4f65396c90c032f816df1722cd83c5debdda17","amp;dn":"Art+Of+The+Western+World+1989+with+Michael+Wood+%5BAtilla82%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4f65396c90c032f816df1722cd83c5debdda17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,79,101,57,108,144,192,50,248,22,223,23,34,205,131,197,222,189,218,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
