The album cover is a close up of SwanÃ¶'s own eye.\r\n\r\nRarely an album is created when the band members, or member â€“ Dan Swano - in this case, showcase true emotion in which the music reflects their feelings at the time.\r\n\r\nWhat relevance does this have? The background is quite interesting; after releasing Edge of Sanityâ€™s 1997 album, Infernal, Dan was forced to leave his own band after the other members teamed up with their label, Black Mark, presumably due to musical differences. You can understand how this must have affected him, and sure enough, he fell into anger and depression. From this rut, Moontower was born.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Sun of the Night&quot;   \t05:14\r\n2. \t&quot;Patchworks&quot;   \t04:59\r\n3. \t&quot;Uncreation&quot;   \t05:40\r\n4. \t&quot;Add Reality&quot;   \t06:17\r\n5. \t&quot;Creating Illusions&quot;   \t04:13\r\n6. \t&quot;The Big Sleep&quot;   \t05:17\r\n7. \t&quot;Encounterparts&quot;   \t06:06\r\n8. \t&quot;In Empty Phrases&quot;   \t05:58\r\n\r\nTotal length:\r\n\t43:44\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n\r\n    Dan SwanÃ¶ - vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, drums, producer, engineering, mixing\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel\r\n\r\n    Peter in de Betou - mastering\r\n    Anders Storm - photography, layout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752377ea31642334635d0184a60a3757032a5475","amp;dn":"Dan+Swan%26ouml%3B+-+Moontower+1998+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752377ea31642334635d0184a60a3757032a5475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,35,119,234,49,100,35,52,99,93,1,132,166,10,55,87,3,42,84,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
