The \nbook will prove to be of use to the students of Soil Mechanics and Foundations \nand will help to bridge the awkward gap \nbetween theory and practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be181a468087c5d12b96f7beb76cf8bc443350bf","amp;dn":"%5BDJVU%5D+%5B2010%5D+An+introduction+to+soil+mechanics+and+foundations%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be181a468087c5d12b96f7beb76cf8bc443350bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,24,26,70,128,135,197,209,43,150,247,190,183,108,248,188,68,51,80,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
