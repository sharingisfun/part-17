Someone had ripped it in a lossy 128kb/s MP3 format,\nwhich was kind of a disappointment.\n\nIt's not even on iTunes or ebay. I have only been able to find the\nvinyl on ebay, not one CD.\n\nAnyway, last year around the beginning of Fall I started posting\nwanted ads on every local listings web site I could think of.\nKijiji, craigslist, etc.\n\nSo here it is in the best quality possible. I was debating on ripping\nit a lossless codec like FLAC but decided it was best to leave it as\noriginal as possible.\n\nThis copy is the original Canadian CD pressing by Now See Hear in\n1993. This is not the American redistribution.\n\nI ripped it with IMGBurn at low speed. So just load up the .cue in\nIMGBurn and burn it to a CD. You will have an exact one to one copy\nof the original.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14f1d8fc268e1b79d71eab4bac23e0e58a68d95e","amp;dn":"FM+-+Black+Noise+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14f1d8fc268e1b79d71eab4bac23e0e58a68d95e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,241,216,252,38,142,27,121,215,30,171,75,172,35,224,229,138,104,217,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
