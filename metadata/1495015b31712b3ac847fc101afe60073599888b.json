Once the CD is loaded in its drive (and an &quot;autorun&quot; feature launches the program automatically and a start program shows all the &quot;credits&quot; that have to be given) You're ready to go: this Cd (whose title, simply, means &quot;The World of Cichlids&quot;) has a multilingual layout offering a three way choice (English/French/German).\nAquarium: by mean of some awesome pictures and some graphicss the minimal technical requisite of a &quot;real&quot; Malawi tanks are discussed. This matter should be well known by every clever cichlid keeper but, just in case ... Technical data are shown in &quot;european&quot; measures which means Celcius degrees and metric lenghts. A minimal bibliography is also offered but, strangely enough, only books by Ad Konings are suggested Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nFish: this section hosts the maximum amout of data AND pictures (not that strange, after all!) with a huge array of seach options. Among the &quot;odd&quot; things is worth remembering the option allowing You to identify (and search) a fish, choosing among given &quot;icons&quot;, my mean of his shape (mouth, fins, tail and so on), colours and/or melanic pattern. Selecting one, or more, of them all fishes sharing that given carachter(s) are shown.\nBy means of a &quot;Click&quot; on a name it's possible to get directly a pic (at least) of the needed species and a short data-sheet including, among others, data such as: maximum attained size, temperament, feeding and spawning behaviour, minimal tank size and so on. In my (humble) opinion the minimal tank size is always, roughly, understimated.\nFull screen: this option allows to stretch pics to the maximum size of your monitor, to enjoy all details.\nSlideshow: this option allows a continuous viewing of all (or only the selected ones) available pics.\nVideo: Contains two long &quot;videos&quot; (&quot;above&quot; and &quot;below&quot; the lake). Viewing these videos requires a lot of computer resources and average image quality isn't, always, the best possible. Any way they are really interesting - mainly the &quot;underwater&quot; section offeringing to the viewer a lot of suggestions on his own tank aquascaping.\nExit: allows you to stop the program and return to main menu.
