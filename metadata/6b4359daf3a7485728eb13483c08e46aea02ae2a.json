Serge grows up amid the noise and silence with his brilliant but troubled older sister, Sophie: an intense sibling relationship that stays with him as he heads off into an equally troubled larger world.\nAfter a fling with a nurse at a Bohemian spa, Serge serves in World War I as a radio operator for reconnaissance planes. When his plane is shot down, Serge is taken to a German prison camp, from which he escapes. Back in London, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recruited for a mission to Cairo on behalf of the shadowy Empire Wireless Chain. All of which eventually carries Serge to a fitfulÃ¢â‚¬â€and perhaps fatefulÃ¢â‚¬â€climax at the bottom of an Egyptian tomb . . .\nOnly a writer like Tom McCarthy could pull off a story with this effortless historical breadth, psychological insight, and postmodern originality","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b4359daf3a7485728eb13483c08e46aea02ae2a","amp;dn":"C+by+Tom+McCarthy+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b4359daf3a7485728eb13483c08e46aea02ae2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,67,89,218,243,167,72,87,40,235,19,72,60,8,228,106,234,2,174,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
