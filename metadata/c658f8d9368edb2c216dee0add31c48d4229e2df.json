Brian Scaddan's approach encourages independent learning with self-assessment questions provided at the end of each chapter.\n\nIn one volume, the book meets the requirements of Level 2 and 3 of the City &amp; Guilds 2330 Certificate and the Level 3 2356 NVQ.\n\nThe material is arranged into logical topic sections rather than following the syllabus structure. This makes the book a handy reference even after the course. A mapping grid to the learning outcomes for the C&amp;G 2330 is included.\n\nThe new edition is fully in line with the 17th Edition Wiring Regulations. In addition, the page design has been improved and the book is now in full colour.\n\n* Fully up-to-date with the 17th Edition Wiring Regulations\n* Tried and trusted content now with improved page design and in full colour\n* Covers both Level 2 and 3 in one volume\n\nAbout the Author\nBrian Scaddan is a consultant and an Honorary Member of City and Guilds.
