After opening with the graceful &quot;In France They Kiss on Main Street,&quot; the album veers sharply into &quot;The Jungle Line,&quot; an odd, Moog-driven piece backed by the rhythms of the warrior drums of Burundi -- a move into multiculturalism that beat the likes of Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, and Sting to the punch by a decade. While not as prescient, songs like &quot;Edith and the Kingpin&quot; and &quot;Harry's House -- Centerpiece&quot; are no less complex or idiosyncratic, employing minor-key melodies and richly detailed lyrics to arrive at a strange and beautiful fusion of jazz and shimmering avant pop.
