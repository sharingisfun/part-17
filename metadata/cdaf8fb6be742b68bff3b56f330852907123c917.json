Hopkins recorded a lot of albums in the 1960s and all are quite listenable even if most are not essential; he did tend to ramble at times! This Candid release is one of his better sets of the period, highlighted by &quot;Take It Easy,&quot; &quot;Mighty Crazy,&quot; and &quot;Mister Charlie.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\nA1 - Take It Easy\nA2 - Mighty Crazy\nA3 - Your Own Fault, Baby, To Treat Me The Way You Do\nA4 - I've Had My Fun If I Don't Get Well No More\nB1 - The Trouble Blues\nB2 - Lightnin's Piano Boogie\nB3 - Wonder Why\nB4 - Mister Charlie\nB5 - Black Cat\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdaf8fb6be742b68bff3b56f330852907123c917","amp;dn":"Lightnin%27+Hopkins+-+1960+-+Lightnin%27+In+New+York+%28vinyl+24+96%29+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdaf8fb6be742b68bff3b56f330852907123c917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,175,143,182,190,116,43,104,191,243,181,111,51,8,82,144,113,35,201,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
