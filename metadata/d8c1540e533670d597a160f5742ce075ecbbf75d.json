Her experiences lead to events that ultimately change the course of human history.\n\n&quot;Extant is a very original concept with layers of humanity, mystery and surprise that reveal itself throughout the script,&quot; said Nina Tassler, President of CBS Entertainment. &quot;Our partnership with Amblin for Under the Dome showed that viewers respond to high-quality event programming in the summer. We look forward to building on that with Extant and offering CBS audiences another high-concept, unique event for summer television.&quot;\n\nSteven Spielberg will executive-produce &quot;Extant&quot; alongside Greg Walker, Brooklyn Weaver, Justin Falvey, Darryl Frank and Mickey Fisher, who will also pen the project.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8c1540e533670d597a160f5742ce075ecbbf75d","amp;dn":"Extant+Season+1+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8c1540e533670d597a160f5742ce075ecbbf75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,193,84,14,83,54,112,213,151,161,96,245,116,44,224,117,236,187,247,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
