The information in this book is still relevant in the world of CDs. The greatest works of 36 composers from Bach to Vivaldi are discussed with just the right amount of detail. A brief biography of the composer is provided along with several recommended recordings (vinyl or tape) for each work. You would need to, of course, go to the latest Penguin Guide or Grammophone Guide, for example, for the comparable CD recordings. It is interesting to compare yesterday's recordings with the latest CD productions, something I am doing as I replace the vinyl in my collection. This book is not anywhere near a complete reference, but it also doesn't overwhelm the novice, and is therefore a satisfying introduction to classical music.&quot;\n\nAmazon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba197cf182b9277d611183cb6d50f2672a247d03","amp;dn":"101+Masterpieces+of+music+and+their+composers+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba197cf182b9277d611183cb6d50f2672a247d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,25,124,241,130,185,39,125,97,17,131,203,109,80,242,103,42,36,125,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
