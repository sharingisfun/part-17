The album follows his successful 1990 soundtrack Blaze of Glory, from the film Young Guns II. The production is quite different from the classic rock norm that is a staple of past Bon Jovi albums, with drum loops, female backing vocals and Bon Jovi himself singing in a lower register in most of the tracks. Only one of his longtime bandmates, David Bryan, contributed to the album, though Desmond Child, co-writer of hits such as &quot;Livin' on a Prayer&quot;, plays the tuba in the song &quot;Ugly&quot; and is also one of the producers\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nCD (1)\n01.
