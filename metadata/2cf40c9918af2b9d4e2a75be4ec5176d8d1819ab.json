Where once-thriving suburbs are now treacherous Wilds. Where those who live for technology battle those who would die rather than embrace it. It is a world of zero-footprint cities, virtual nations, and armed camps of eco-survivalists.\n\nWelcome to the dawn of uncivilization.\n\nMETAtropolis is an intelligent and stunning creation of five of today's cutting-edge science-fiction writers: 2008 Hugo Award winners John Scalzi and Elizabeth Bear; Campbell Award winner Jay Lake; plus fan favorites Tobias Buckell and Karl Schroeder. Together they set the ground rules and developed the parameters of this &quot;shared universe&quot;, then wrote five original novellas - all linked, but each a separate tale.\n\nBringing this audiobook to life is a dream team of performers: Battlestar Galactica's Michael Hogan (&quot;Saul Tigh&quot;); Alessandro Juliani (&quot;Felix Gaeta&quot;); and Kandyse McClure (&quot;Anastasia 'Dee' Dualla&quot;); plus legendary audiobook narrators Scott Brick (Dune) and Stefan Rudnicki (Ender's Game).\n\nJohn Scalzi, who served as Project Editor, introduces each story, offering insight into how the METAtropolis team created this unique project exclusively for digital audio.\n\n\n\nMETAtropolis: Cascadia\nUNABRIDGED\nby Jay Lake , Mary Robinette Kowal , Elizabeth Bear , Ken Scholes , Karl Schroeder , Tobias Buckell\nNarrated by Rene Auberjonois , Kate Mulgrew , Wil Wheaton , Gates McFadden , Jonathan Frakes , LeVar Burton , Jay Lake\n\nPublisher's Summary\n\nThis provocative sequel to the Hugo and Audie Award nominated METAtropolis features interconnected stories by todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top writers of speculative fiction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ performed by a galaxy of Star Trek stars.\n\nAs the mid-20th century approaches, the Pacific Northwest has been transformed - politically, economically, and ecologically - into the new reality of Cascadia. Conspiracies and secrets threaten the tenuous threads of society. The End of Days seems nearer than ever. And the legend of the mysterious Tygre Tygre looms large.\n\nMETAtropolis: Cascadia is the creation of Hugo and World Fantasy Award nominee Jay Lake; Mary Robinette Kowal, winner of the John W.
