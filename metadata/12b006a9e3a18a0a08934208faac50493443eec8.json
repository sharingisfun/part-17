During experiments to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, a genetically-enhanced chimpanzee uses its greater intelligence to lead other apes to freedom.\n\nCAST:\nJames Franco\nAndy Serkis\nJohn Lithgow \nFreida Pinto\n\n\nDETAILS:\nEnglish\nRun Time: 105 Minutes\nIMDB: tt1318514\n\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION: Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a revolution; an action-packed epic featuring stunning visual effects and creatures unlike anything ever seen before. At the story's heart is Caesar (Andy Serkis), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug. Raised like a child by the drug's creator (James Franco), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned. Seeking justice, Caesar assembles a simian army and escapes -- putting man and primate on a collision course that could change the planet forever.\n\nPlease SEED!
