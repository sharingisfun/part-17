The size is kept at under 4 gig for storage on ps3 external fat 32 hdd. \nAlso plays back nicely on pc at 720p on a 1280x1024 desktop ( or there abouts ) and gives a brilliant quality source for convert X to dvd. Convert X can produce a dvd from this file thats as good as an origional.\n\nYou can use a program called tsmuxer to create a blue ray disk from this file. You can also add the included dts file for 5.1 audio.\n\nThe origional dts track is included as is for people to re-encode for 5.1 aac or to add to a dvd or blue ray. To encode to aac use megui and the nero aac codec.\n\nThe file name has been shortened because some people don&amp;#039;t realised that the file name has to be simple for ps3 playback. This should stop people thinking its broken because the filename has spaces...\n\nIf your going to playback on ps3, drop the file in a folder before playing, this should stop anyone from getting corruption messeges.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nThe origional English dts audio track from the blue ray remux was missing nearly an hour of audio so I found a matching audio track in stacey&amp;#039;s 1080p rip. Sorry Max1g but it looks like the your demux cut off early for that track.\n\nEnjoy this HD movie.\n\n-==D-L33T3==-\n\nPilot Release Group\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f11ff455412d58ba407da8817f3b3570a0166af","amp;dn":"Ironman%5B2008%5DBDRip%5B720p%5Dh264+-+D-L33T3%5BPilot+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f11ff455412d58ba407da8817f3b3570a0166af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,17,255,69,84,18,213,139,164,7,218,136,23,243,179,87,10,1,102,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
