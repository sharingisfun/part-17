SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also opinionatedÃ¢â‚¬â€especially when it comes to people she hates. Like people who think giving birth is a unique achievement. Or well-adjusted, a.k.a. boring, ex-child stars who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even have a decent addiction.\n\nWith all of her diverse experiences, it stands to reason that Joan has seen, done, said, and heard a lot of hateful things. Thank god, she took notes.\n \nHereÃ¢â‚¬â€uncensored and totally uninhibitedÃ¢â‚¬â€she give the best of her worst to First Ladies, closet cases, hypocrites, Hollywood, feminists, and overrated historical figures. And even when letting herself have it, Joan doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold back in this honest, unabashedly hilarious love letter to the hater in all of us.
