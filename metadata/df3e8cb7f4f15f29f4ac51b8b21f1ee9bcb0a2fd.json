There is also a good deal about the (in)famous hedgefund &quot;Long Term Capital Management) LTCM, which at its pinnacle controlled positions valued at $1200 billion!\nBankruptcy was narrowly avoided in the late 90's with a massive bailout, arranged by the New York FED, by the world's largest banks. There was a fear that global financial markets would seize to work if the fund went bust.\n\nThis is a great documentary for anyone working with or studying finance or simply have a general interest in the subject.\n\n\n\nNova Online @ PBS: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/stockmarket/\n\nTeaser: http://www.you tube.com/watch?v=xGfXyVtiB1E\n\nEnjoy =)\n\n\n\nBy PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥l R.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3e8cb7f4f15f29f4ac51b8b21f1ee9bcb0a2fd","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Horizon+-+1999+-+The+Midas+Formula+%28LTCM%2C+Black-Scholes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3e8cb7f4f15f29f4ac51b8b21f1ee9bcb0a2fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,62,140,183,244,241,95,41,244,172,81,184,178,31,30,233,188,176,162,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
