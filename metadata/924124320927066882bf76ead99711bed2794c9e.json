Each of the films I have made has been shot in a different language, in a different country. At the end of Babel, I was so exhausted I made it a point that my next film would be about just one character, with one point of view, in one single city, with a straight narrative line and in my own native language. Using a musical analogy, if Babel was an opera, Biutiful is a requiem. . . and here I am. Biutiful is all that I haven\\\\\\'t done: a linear story whose characters shape the narrative in an unexplored genre for me: the tragedy.\n\nBiutiful for me is a reflection akin to our brief and humble permanence in this life. Our existence, short-lived as the flicker of a star, only reveals to us its ineffable brevity once we are close to death. Recently, I thought of my own death. Where do we go and what do we transform into when we die? Into the memory of others. This is the anguishing and dizzying race against time that Uxbal faces. What does a man do in his final days of life? Does he dedicate himself to living or to dying? Perhaps Kurosawa was right when he said our dreams of transcendence are just that: an illusion. Regardless, since the film\\\\\\'s inception, I was never interested in making a movie about death, but a reflection in and about life when our inevitable loss of it occurs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img638.imageshack.us/img638/4102/biutiful1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img638.imageshack.us/img638/4102/biutiful1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/8303/biutiful4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/8303/biutiful4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4005/biutiful6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4005/biutiful6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8623/biutiful12.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/8623/biutiful12.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------not my rip------\n\n\tFile Name .........................................: Biutiful.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,202,083,328 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:21:32\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 688x384 (AR: 1.792)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1684 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.255 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [6 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n   \n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
