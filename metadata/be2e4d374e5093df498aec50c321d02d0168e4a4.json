I upload A LOT of material about 9/11 being a staged event, and they seem to trigger a lot of those false virus warnings from a user named &quot;b2pilot187&quot;. Now, he is obviously either a disinformer or simply just the everyday-idiot, because my files are videofiles, hence impossible to infect with a virus. This user has been reported to the admins of this place, so I hope this matter will be solved sooner rather than later. Until then, simply ignore this person. But I would urge anyone not to ignore a virusscan in any event. I suspect he won't even read this, because he simply searches for &quot;911&quot; and spam each and every post with these warnings. Hence, you will probably find another one below, in the comment section.***\n\nReVIsed alias Masterpiece\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThree of the four terrorist pilots learned to fly in tiny Venice, Florida, a sleepy retirement community with the second oldest population of any city in the entire United States... They attended flight schools owned by two Dutch nationals, one of whom has Mob ties.\n\nDid 19 Arab terrorists from desert Kingdoms roam around in Florida as if they'd been listening to Tom Petty albums all their lives all by themselves? Or were they being trained here in a still-secret covert intelligence operation that somehow went horribly wrong?\n\nFilesize.....: 525 MB (or 537,880 KB or 550,789,120 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:02:04 (111,599 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1057 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 117 kb/s (58/ch, stereo) VBR \nFrame Size...: 416x320 (1.30:1) [=13:10]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be2e4d374e5093df498aec50c321d02d0168e4a4","amp;dn":"911+-+Mohamed+Atta+%26+the+Venice+Flying+Circus+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be2e4d374e5093df498aec50c321d02d0168e4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,46,77,55,78,80,147,223,73,138,236,80,195,33,208,45,1,104,228,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
