Together they perform three Dorham and two Henderson originals, advanced music that was open to the influence of the avant-garde while remaining in the hard bop idiom. The up-tempo blues &quot;Teeter Totter&quot; contrasts with the four minor-toned pieces and, even if none of these songs became standards, the playing is consistently brilliant and unpredictable. Even at this relatively early stage, Joe Henderson showed his potential as a great tenorman. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Teeter Totter\n02. Pedro's Time\n03. Our Thing\n04. Back Road\n05. Escapade\n06. Teeter Totter (alt tk)\n\nPersonnel:\nKenny Dorham - trumpet\nJoe Henderson - tenor saxophone\nPete La Roca - drums\nAndrew Hill - piano\nEddie Khan - double bass\n\nEnjoy and share!
