That is, until he kills the wrong guy and is forced to flee the States, leaving behind the life he knows and loves. Suddenly, he finds himself on a plane hurtling toward Reykjavik disguised as American televangelist Father Friendly. With no means of escape from this island devoid of gun shops, this country with absolutely no tradition for contract killing, he is forced to come to terms with his bloody past and reevaluate his future, to tragicomic effect. Toxic paints Iceland as an icy netherworld where in spite of peaceful appearances danger lurks - in the guise of terrifying romantic overtures with tough-girl Gunholder, fear of being caught in his blasphemous deception, and the threat of punishment at the hands of Thordur... whose name seems to be pronounced Torture.\n\n\nAbout the Author: Hallgrimur Helgason\n \n\nThough you may know Hallgrimur Helgason from the popular audiobook The Hitman's Guide to Housecleaning, Helgason is actually one of the most renowned Mysteries &amp; Thrillers authors in our catalog.
