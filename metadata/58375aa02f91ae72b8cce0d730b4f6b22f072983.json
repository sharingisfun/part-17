In the very hard way.\n \nAnd this former Band came from... Finland..!!!? http://backslidersband.tripod.com/bio.html\n \n \n \nInteresting? Want a really rough Rrrrock nÃ‚Â´ Roll?? Download this bad*ss CD and turn volume full.\n \nSecond thought: Turn volume to &quot;Are You Nuts?&quot;. Your neighbours gonna Love it too.\n \nThis ultimate rare CD really deserved to be ripped as FLAC. I guess this is the only FLAC piece in the Torrent scene and maybe in the whole internet.\n \n \nNow swallow Your bun and Rock On..!?\n \n \n \nIf You like this upload, please share it with other Big Fans by seeding.
