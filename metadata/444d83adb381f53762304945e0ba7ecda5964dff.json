This show at the Reading Festival in 1983 came at the end of their farewell tour, and was originally intended to be the band's last concert.\n\nAlthough they officially split up in 1983, Thin Lizzy played several more concerts after this recording, including the Monsters of Rock festival in Germany a week later. A similar lineup under the name Grand Slam performed a series of concerts in 1984 and 1985, before Phil Lynott's death in 1986.\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource \tRating\nAllmusic \t2/5 stars link\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Jailbreak&quot; (Phil Lynott)\n    &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; (Brian Downey, Lynott)\n    &quot;Waiting for an Alibi&quot; (Lynott)\n    &quot;Are You Ready&quot; (Downey, Scott Gorham, Lynott, Brian Robertson)\n    &quot;Baby Please Don't Go&quot; (Lynott)\n    &quot;A Night in the Life of a Blues Singer&quot; (Lynott)\n    &quot;The Holy War&quot; (Lynott)\n    &quot;The Sun Goes Down&quot; (Lynott, Darren Wharton)\n    &quot;Emerald&quot; (Gorham, Downey, Robertson, Lynott)\n    &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; (Downey, Lynott)\n    &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot; (Lynott)\n    &quot;Suicide&quot; (Lynott)\n    &quot;Rosalie Medley: Rosalie/Dancing in the Moonlight/The Cowgirl Song&quot; (Bob Seger/Lynott/ Lynott, Downey)\n    &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; (Lynott)\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Phil Lynott - bass guitar, vocals\n    Scott Gorham - guitar, backing vocals\n    John Sykes - guitar, backing vocals\n    Brian Downey - drums, percussion\n    Darren Wharton - keyboards, backing vocals\n\n\n\nThin Lizzy\n\n    Brian Downey\n    Scott Gorham\n    Darren Wharton\n    Marco Mendoza\n    Ricky Warwick\n    Damon Johnson\n\n    Phil Lynott\n    Eric Bell\n    Eric Wrixon\n    Gary Moore\n    Brian Robertson\n    Snowy White\n    John Sykes\n    Andy Gee\n    John Cann\n    Dave Flett\n    Mark Nauseef\n    Randy Gregg\n    Francesco DiCosmo\n    Tommy Aldridge\n    Michael Lee\n    Vivian Campbell\n    Richard Fortus\n\nStudio albums \t\n\n    Thin Lizzy\n    Shades of a Blue Orphanage\n    Vagabonds of the Western World\n    Nightlife\n    Fighting\n    Jailbreak\n    Johnny the Fox\n    Bad Reputation\n    Black Rose: A Rock Legend\n    Chinatown\n    Renegade\n    Thunder and Lightning\n\nLive albums \t\n\n    Live and Dangerous\n    Life\n    BBC Radio One Live in Concert\n    The Peel Sessions\n    The Boys Are Back in Town: Live in Australia\n    One Night Only\n    UK Tour '75\n    Still Dangerous\n\nCompilations \t\n\n    Remembering Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Part 1\n    The Continuing Saga of the Ageing Orphans\n    The Adventures of Thin Lizzy\n    Dedication\n    Wild One\n    Whiskey in the Jar\n    Vagabonds, Kings, Warriors, Angels\n    Greatest Hits\n    The Definitive Collection\n\nSongs \t\n\n    &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;\n    &quot;The Rocker&quot;\n    &quot;Still in Love with You&quot;\n    &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;\n    &quot;Jailbreak&quot;\n    &quot;Waiting for an Alibi&quot;\n    &quot;Do Anything You Want To&quot;\n    &quot;Sarah&quot;\n    &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot;\n    &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot;\n    &quot;Angel of Death&quot;\n    &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;\n    &quot;The Sun Goes Down&quot;\n\nVideos and DVDs \t\n\n    Thin Lizzy Live at Sydney Harbour '78\n    One Night in Dublin: A Tribute to Phil Lynott                            ..If you like it seed it...............................\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:444d83adb381f53762304945e0ba7ecda5964dff","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+Live++1983++BBC1++VBR+++ak1983+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"444d83adb381f53762304945e0ba7ecda5964dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,77,131,173,179,129,245,55,98,48,73,69,224,186,126,205,165,150,77,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
