He determines that White cannot support his recommended new version deletions of words and whole verses, fissures which make the ESV, NIV, HCSB, and TNIV collapse under the heavy weight of OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s scholarship. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly goes behind WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crumbling faÃƒÂ§ade to find him derelict in his duty to present quotes accurately or in context. White has even been forced to muster-up a second edition of his book, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe King James Only Controversy,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to patch holes and weak points which gave a gaping view of his bare-bones knowledge and his impoverished character. Like a snake, the book has shed its cover for a new one, behind which White cannot still hide his out-of-date Ã¢â‚¬Ëœscholarship.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly states, Ã¢â‚¬Å“My considered opinion is that James White has condensed into one volume virtually all the criticisms of the AV1611 that fundamentalists have leveled over the decades. WhiteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s junk-mail order degree is no match for true British scholarship, as OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 800 page volume proves.\n\n\n[u]About the author:[/u]\n Alan OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly was born in Sydney, Australia and is a Chemical Engineer by training. Through the witness of The Navigators, he became a Christian while a student at the University of New South Wales in 1967. For the last 25 years, he has extensively investigated the text of the Authorised Version of the Bible. Covenant Publishers have made much of this research available in a 352-page book entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“O BibliosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Alan is a contender for the faith, believing that Ã¢â‚¬Å“all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,&quot; which has been preserved in the Authorized Version of the Holy Bible. His writings are a superb blend of the spiritual (you will smile, laugh, and be blessed!) and the academic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723d653114abc28df9218122aa9f70bf98404c13","amp;dn":"The+%27Whitewash%27+Conspiracy+-+Alan+O%27Reilly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723d653114abc28df9218122aa9f70bf98404c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,61,101,49,20,171,194,141,249,33,129,34,170,159,112,191,152,64,76,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
