Batman teams up with Lady Shiva in Calcutta to keep the Ebola Gulf virus from being released in the target city. Continued in DETECTIVE COMICS #701.\n\n#535  A very powerful being is killing Gothamites and the only clue to the killer's identity is graffiti scrawled on the walls of the city's buildings. Batman must solve the puzzle before the body count rises, and face one of the strangest adversaries in his career: the Ogre. \n\n#536  As the cold, dark night falls upon Gotham and the world, Batman must cope with a Man-Bat who is driven over the edge and begins to prey upon humans. \n\n#537  Man-Bat is in the Arctic about to prey upon members of a research expedition while being pursued by three deadly killers with orders to destroy him--assassins who are, in turn, hunted by the Batman. \n\n#538  Far north in the Arctic, Batman fights to save the tortured Man-Bat, who has now lost all humanity and is ready to destroy anyone and anything-including himself. \n\n#539  Someone is robbing the graves of Gotham City and Batman must discover who--and why--before it's too late. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to the OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O. for this release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f72aa2a58d3d0e267b12db457b8f4bc469f588bc","amp;dn":"Batman+534-539+%281996-09%29+%28digital%29+%28OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O.-Novus-HD%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f72aa2a58d3d0e267b12db457b8f4bc469f588bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,42,162,165,141,61,14,38,123,18,219,69,123,143,75,196,105,245,136,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
