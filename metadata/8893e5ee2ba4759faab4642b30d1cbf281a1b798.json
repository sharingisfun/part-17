Following the progression makes for an interesting endeavor as Stevens learns to harness his ambitious ideas with arrangements that don't obscure his rhapsodic messages. Few artists of his generation were more gifted when it came to plucking timeless melodies out of thin air, and his sumptuous voice was always able to movingly convey his bittersweet lyrics. As a career overview this set achieves its goal, hitting all of the chart successes along the way and basically defining his role as a sensitive '70s singer-songwriter, but some fans may opt for the classic early-'70s studio records, which find Stevens at his most consistently touching. \n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Moonshadow\n[02] Father And Son\n[03] Morning Has Broken\n[04] Wild World\n[05] The First Cut Is The Deepest\n[06] Lady D'Arbanville\n[07] Oh Very Young\n[08] Matthew And Son\n[09] Sitting\n[10] Hard Headed Woman\n[11] I Love My Dog\n[12] Rubylove\n[13] Don't Be Shy\n[14] Can't Keep It In\n[15] Here Comes My Baby\n[16] Into White\n[17] (Remember The Days Of The) Old Schoolyard\n[18] Where Do The Children Play?\n[19] How Can I Tell You\n[20] Another Saturday Night\n[21] Sad Lisa\n[22] Just Another Night\n[23] Peace Train\n[24] If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:17m33:s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 189mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 2004\nRecord Company\t&gt; Universal Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.catstevens.com \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Stevens \n\t&gt; http://www.lyricsmania.com/cat_stevens_lyrics.html \n\t&gt;[Hard Headed Woman]\n\t&gt;[Father And Son]\n\t&gt;[Wild World]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8893e5ee2ba4759faab4642b30d1cbf281a1b798","amp;dn":"%5B2004%5D+The+Very+Best+Of+-+Cat.+Stevens+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8893e5ee2ba4759faab4642b30d1cbf281a1b798","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,147,229,238,43,164,117,159,170,180,100,43,48,209,203,242,129,161,183,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
