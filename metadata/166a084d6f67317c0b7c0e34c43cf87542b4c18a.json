The freedom to run the program for any purpose;\n2. The freedom to study and modify the program;\n3. The freedom to copy the program so you can help your neighbour, and\n4. The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements to the public, so that the\n  whole community benefits.\nFreedoms 2 and 4 require access to the source because studying and modifying software without source\ncode1 is extremely difficult and highly inefficient since humans cannot usually understand machine code\nor object code.\nThe Open Source definition published by the Open Source Initiative states that:\n1. The license should not prohibit free redistribution;\n2. The program must include source code and must allow distribution in source code as well as\n  compiled form;\n3. The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow them to be distributed\n  under the same terms as the license of the original software;\n4. The integrity of the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s source code and reputation must be maintained by requiring derived\n    works to carry a different name or version number from the original software;\n5. The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons;\n6. The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of\n  endeavour;\n7. The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the program is redistributed,\n  without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties;\n8. The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program being part of a particular\n  software distribution;\n9. The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed\n  software; and\n10. No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.\n\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\n\nSeed for us....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166a084d6f67317c0b7c0e34c43cf87542b4c18a","amp;dn":"foss-network-infrastructure-and-security-covers.pdf+%7B+UPPOG2+%7D+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166a084d6f67317c0b7c0e34c43cf87542b4c18a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,106,8,77,111,103,49,124,11,124,14,52,196,60,248,117,66,180,193,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
