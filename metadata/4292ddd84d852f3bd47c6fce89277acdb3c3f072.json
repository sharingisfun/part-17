But for meticulous detail, we have to dip into exotic huesÃ¢â‚¬â€leptons, mesons, hadrons, quarks. Bringing particle physics to life as few authors can, Jeremy Bernstein here unveils nature in all its subatomic splendor.\n\nIn this graceful account, Bernstein guides us through high-energy physics from the early twentieth century to the present, including such highlights as the newly discovered Higgs boson. Beginning with Ernest RutherfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1911 explanation of the nucleus, a model of atomic structure emerged that sufficed until the 1930s, when new particles began to be theorized and experimentally confirmed. In the postwar period, the subatomic world exploded in a blaze of unexpected findings leading to the theory of the quark, in all its strange and charmed variations. An eyewitness to developments at Harvard University and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Bernstein laces his story with piquant anecdotes of such luminaries as Wolfgang Pauli, Murray Gell-Mann, and Sheldon Glashow.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4292ddd84d852f3bd47c6fce89277acdb3c3f072","amp;dn":"A+Palette+of+Particles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4292ddd84d852f3bd47c6fce89277acdb3c3f072","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,146,221,216,77,133,47,59,212,124,111,206,137,39,122,205,179,195,240,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
