He has a conveniently located cabin in the KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥seberga area on ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œsterlen in SkÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ne, a beautiful wife, Ann-Marie, and daughter, Nina. All things considered, he should be happy but instead he feels unharmonical, lonely and disoriented. As every other summer he has invited his friends to a small party. Inger and Kent, a young couple in the divoce process are also there. During the preparations for the party, Keve leaves the cabin and walks about in the nearby village. He finds a poster which announces a lecture being held this day. He knows the lecturer BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn briefly and decides to go listen to what he has to say. At this very lecture he finds BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rns wife Evabritt who makes a profound impression on Keve... \n\nAfterword: From Widerbergs official biography it is revealed that Michelangelo Antonioni was a guest critic of the Swedish movie magazine Chaplin and remarked [on this feature] that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ...his film (Love 65) has life, precise characters, intensive scenes and a certain sense of humour.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n\nKent Andersson\t ...\tKent\nThommy Berggren\t ...\tActor\nBen Carruthers\t ...\tBenito (as Benito Carruthers)\nAgneta Ekmanner\t ...\tActress\nBjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Gustafson\t ...\tBjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn\nAnn-Marie Gyllenspetz\t ...\tAnn-Marie\nKeve Hjelm\t ...\tKeve\nEva-Britt Strandberg\t ...\tEva-Britt\nInger Taube\t ...\tInger\nNina Widerberg\t ...\tNina\n\nkarlek.65_aka_love.65.1965.vhs.xvid.avi                     \nFile Size (in bytes):                           734,199,808                     \n                                                                                \n--- Container Information ---                                                   \nBase Type (e.g &quot;AVI&quot;):                          AVI(.AVI)                 \nSubtype (e.g &quot;OpenDML&quot;):                        OpenDML (AVI v2.0),                   \nInterleave (in ms):                             40          \nPreload (in ms):                                480       \nAudio alignment(&quot;split across interleaves&quot;):    Aligned         \nBytes Missing (if any):                         0            \nNumber of Audio Streams:                        1       \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD 1.1.2 Final              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:32:03                \nFrame Count:                                    138060             \nFrame Width x Height (pixels):                  576 x 384 \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.500                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.500                     \nFrames Per Second:                              25.000          \nPics Per Second:                                25.000            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           960                 \nMPEG-4:                                         MPEG-4                   \n[B-VOP][QPel][GMC][NVOP][H264]:                 [B-VOP][][][][]   \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:              0.174&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):                             \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):                  \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            90                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):            VBR            \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      1 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:953be5f80d145941b880db2b69f690721157bcd1","amp;dn":"Karlek+65+aka+Love+65+%28Bo+Widerberg%2C+1965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"953be5f80d145941b880db2b69f690721157bcd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,59,229,248,13,20,89,65,184,128,219,43,105,246,144,114,17,87,188,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
