Decorating with air plants is made easy with stunning photographs that showcase ideas for using them mounted on walls, suspended from the ceiling, as living bows and jewelry, as screens, and in unique containers, like leather pouches, dishes, and baskets. Six step-by-step projects include a wood mount, a wall hook, lasso-and-hook wiring, a ceramic-frame garden, and three unique terrariums.\n\n\nEPUB,Retail: 224 pages\nPublisher: Timber Press (September 30, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1604694890\nISBN-13: 978-1604694895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e831a4475590a85220f8368e00c273ccc89d03","amp;dn":"Air+Plants%3AThe+Curious+World+of+Tillandsias%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e831a4475590a85220f8368e00c273ccc89d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,232,49,164,71,85,144,168,82,32,248,54,142,0,194,115,204,200,157,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
