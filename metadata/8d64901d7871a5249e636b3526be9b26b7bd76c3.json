This includes nonhydrostatic processes such as breaking internal waves and density-driven convection, but the model code is also used to simulate an El-NiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o event! The book contains 25 practical exercises, using freely available Open-Source software suites, which are widely used by the scientific community. In this book, the art of hydrodynamic modelling is made available and transparent to a wider readership. An attractive byproduct of the book is that results are animations rather than still images. Model codes and animation scripts for all exercises are supplied on a website. The reader can adopt model codes for own independent studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d64901d7871a5249e636b3526be9b26b7bd76c3","amp;dn":"Advanced+Ocean+Modelling%3A+Using+Open-Source+Software","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d64901d7871a5249e636b3526be9b26b7bd76c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,100,144,29,120,113,165,36,158,99,107,53,38,190,155,38,183,189,118,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
