Now, with the intellectual curiosity and emotional wisdom that make his columns among the most read in the nation, Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered, profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life.\n\nThis is the story of how success happens. It is told through the lives of one composite American couple, Harold and EricaÃ¢â‚¬â€how they grow, push forward, are pulled back, fail, and succeed. Distilling a vast array of information into these two vividly realized characters, Brooks illustrates a fundamental new understanding of human nature. A scientific revolution has occurredÃ¢â‚¬â€we have learned more about the human brain in the last thirty years than we had in the previous three thousand. The unconscious mind, it turns out, is most of the mindÃ¢â‚¬â€not a dark, vestigial place but a creative and enchanted one, where most of the brainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work gets done. This is the realm of emotions, intuitions, biases, longings, genetic predispositions, personality traits, and social norms: the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made. The natural habitat of The Social Animal.\n \nDrawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines, Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to school; from the Ã¢â‚¬Å“odyssey yearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that have come to define young adulthood to the high walls of poverty; from the nature of attachment, love, and commitment, to the nature of effective leadership. He reveals the deeply social aspect of our very minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism, individualism, and IQ. Along the way, he demolishes conventional definitions of success while looking toward a culture based on trust and humility.\n\nThe Social Animal is a moving and nuanced intellectual adventure, a story of achievement and a defense of progress. Impossible to put down, it is an essential book for our time, one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1774563776a810988943f6abecbc5c4879056931","amp;dn":"The+Social+Animal+-+David+Brooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1774563776a810988943f6abecbc5c4879056931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,116,86,55,118,168,16,152,137,67,246,171,236,188,92,72,121,5,105,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
