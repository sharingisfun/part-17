An engaging thriller, full of hidden promise, and a suspenseful string of twists and turns. Heaven played the festival circuit to much critical acclaim in '98 and then disappeared after a quiet, week long theatrical release in LA only. A true hidden gem that deserves a much bigger audience than it's received so far!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a76e41154e5d470afd9de0b31974c24de67ca77","amp;dn":"Heaven+1998+%28Karl+Urban%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a76e41154e5d470afd9de0b31974c24de67ca77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,118,228,17,84,229,212,112,175,217,222,11,49,151,76,36,222,103,202,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
