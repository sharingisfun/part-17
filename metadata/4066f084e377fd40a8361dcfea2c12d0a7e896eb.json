The title track was a Top Ten R&amp;B hit, thanks in part to Michael Jackson's presence on background vocals, and another single also made the charts. Ross wasn't the powerhouse she was in the 1970s, but she was still doing well enough to keep making records.&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio:\n\n&quot;Eaten Alive is a 1985 album released by Diana Ross on the RCA label. The album featured the top ten R&amp;B title track produced and composed by Michael Jackson with the rest of the album conceived by members of the Bee Gees including the number one UK hit, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;. The Brothers Gibb accompanied Ross in the background on most of the tracks with Jackson singing along Ross on &quot;Eaten Alive&quot;. &quot;Experience&quot; was also released as a single, reaching UK # 47. &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; also made UK # 20 on its reissue in 1993 and was covered by Steps in 2001&quot;.\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nEaten Alive\n===========\n\n01.
