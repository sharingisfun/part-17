King? Hmm. Perhaps. The tracks are extremely versatile. No 1, &quot;Hummingbird&quot; is a kind of sad soul song. No 2, &quot;Cook county Jail introduction&quot; is just an intro for no 3, &quot;How Blue can you get,&quot; which swings at a persons ears (my favorite track!) No 4, &quot;Caldonia&quot; goes back to the roots of jazz and blues, with trombones and trumpets (why does it remind me of dixieland?) No 5 Sweet Sixteen is a lot like &quot;How Blue can you Get?&quot; except the vocals start earlier and they have a different theme. Ah, yes, no 6, &quot;Why I sing the Blues.&quot; Faster, more fun, more soul to it! No 7 is &quot;The thrill is gone.&quot; Interesting guitar and organ work at the beggining. No 8 &quot;Nobody loves me but my Mother&quot; takes King of the guitar and onto the piano, and when it ends, you'll think your CD is messed up, but its all part of the music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:304a530f627a276abad1934f0d8a245f69e5ed7f","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+B.B.+King+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1987+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"304a530f627a276abad1934f0d8a245f69e5ed7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,74,83,15,98,122,39,106,186,209,147,79,13,138,36,95,105,229,237,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
