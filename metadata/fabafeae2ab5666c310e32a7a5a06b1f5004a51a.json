Inspired by this resurgence, he brings back his Kick-Ass persona, joining a team of fellow vigilantes called &quot;Justice Forever&quot;. The team, led by Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), includes Dave's friend Marty (Clark Duke), now known as Battle Guy, and love interest Night-Bitch (Lindy Booth). Mindy Macready (ChloÃƒÂ« Grace Moretz) reluctantly retires from her Hit-Girl persona at the request of her new guardian, Marcus (Morris Chestnut). Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), upset at his mother's (Yancy Butler) apathy towards his father's death, accidentally kills her with a tanning bed. Free from his mother's control and extremely wealthy from her inheritance, Chris resurfaces as the world's first supervillain, calling himself &quot;The Motherfucker&quot;.\n\nInitially the Justice Forever takes on low level hero jobs like helping poor people and patrolling the streets. Night-Bitch and Kick-Ass take on casual sex encounters after patrolling without taking off their masks. The first serious job they have is to take down a brothel where illegal girls are used as prostitutes. The take-down is successful, but no one knows that the brothel was protected by ChrisÃ‚Â´s uncle, the new boss of the mafia. When the team found a lot of money, they decide to bring it to the girls to allow her to have a normal life instead of taking it for themselves. Dave is unsuccessful to bring Mindy to the group and also to bring his other friend, Todd, that he wants to dress and call himself like DaveÃ‚Â´s superhero persona and ends taking distance with his friends.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fabafeae2ab5666c310e32a7a5a06b1f5004a51a","amp;dn":"Kick-Ass+2+TSRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fabafeae2ab5666c310e32a7a5a06b1f5004a51a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,186,254,174,42,181,102,108,49,14,50,167,165,160,107,31,80,4,165,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
