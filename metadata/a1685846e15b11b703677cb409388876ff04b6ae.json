The couple sadly lost their 26-year-old son two years ago and haven't had the heart to work on the garden since. They want to recapture some of the happy times they spent out there with a peaceful space to relax and reflect in, and they have a budget of Â£5,000 to achieve it. The designers have their work cut out as they compete to design this important space - all they have to work with is a featureless lawn, a long concrete path and a prominent row of sheds at the bottom of the garden. They pull out all the stops and each come up with special designs to bring some much-needed joy to this plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 14-Jul-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1685846e15b11b703677cb409388876ff04b6ae","amp;dn":"Garden+Rescue+S01E04+WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1685846e15b11b703677cb409388876ff04b6ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,104,88,70,225,91,17,183,3,103,124,180,9,56,136,118,255,4,182,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
