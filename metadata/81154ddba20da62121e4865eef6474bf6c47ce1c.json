It was back in the late 19th century in Rio de Janeiro when Brazilian musicians started to blend European melodies, Afro-Brazilian rhythms and the melancholic interpretation of the Brazilian Indians' music to create Choro. Choro is credited as being the first musical expression of Brazil's melting pot and had a prominent place in the development of Brazil's cultural identity. Choro remained a major popular music style until the 1920s, leading directly into Samba and later to Bossa Nova. After a slight decline in popularity, Choro music has made a remarkable comeback over the past few decades.\n\nThe film remembers the history but shows, above all, a colorful picture of Choro's vitality today. The guiding line of the film is the combo &quot;Trio Madeira Brasil&quot; composed of three of Brazil's outstanding Choro musicians. During a &quot;Roda de Choro&quot;, a traditional Brazilian kind of private jam session, the Trio brings up a concert project. During these sessions or at their homes, some of the most interesting Choro musicians play and remember key events in the history of this Brazilian urban music. A look into a Choro workshop with over 450 participants of all ages illustrates the off-hand genuine Brazilian way to play. &quot;Playing&quot; interviews with well-known Samba and Bossa Nova artists like Zez Gonzaga, Elza Soares and Guinga illustrate the reciprocal inspiration with Samba and Bossa Nova music. A final show of the &quot;Trio Madeira Brasil&quot; with their guests in one of Rio's traditional music halls show once more the opulence of rhythms and melodies in Choro that has evolved over the past 130 years into a fascinating form of modern tropical sound.&quot;\n\nThe film is in Portuguese with hard-coded English subtitles. One of the interviews is in Portuguese, but does not have any subtitles - that's how it was on the DVD.\n\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81154ddba20da62121e4865eef6474bf6c47ce1c","amp;dn":"The+Sound+Of+Rio+-+Brasileirinho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81154ddba20da62121e4865eef6474bf6c47ce1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,21,77,219,162,13,166,33,33,228,134,94,239,100,116,191,108,71,206,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
