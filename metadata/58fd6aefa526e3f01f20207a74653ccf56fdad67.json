Human settlements are ringed by a dense wilderness from which ferocious new animal species prey on the helpless. The high ground belongs to the rich and powerful that overlook swampland shantytowns from their fortress-like cities. Iron-fisted rule ensures order and allows the wealthy to harvest the poor as slaves. Welcome to the world of Orchid.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Each issue to be promoted with a new song by Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine!\n\n\nAll credit goes to the original scanners!\n\n\nEnjoy and seed!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58fd6aefa526e3f01f20207a74653ccf56fdad67","amp;dn":"Orchid+%2301+-+%2312+%28Complete%29+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58fd6aefa526e3f01f20207a74653ccf56fdad67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,253,106,239,165,38,227,240,31,32,32,122,116,101,60,207,86,253,173,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
