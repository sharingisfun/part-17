There's rock 'n' roll. And there's Motorhead, the unique institution that combines them both with evil panache and blows your speakers in the process......... After three decades and counting, Motorhead have achieved a status in the public's affections that few bands can even contemplate, without ever abandoning their high-energy, high-volume grind or making any concessions to the vagaries of fashion. Although the band effortlessly outstrip many of their so-called contemporaries in terms of sheer riff weight and commitment, the players are firmly rooted in a tradition of musicianship that many observers overlook, assuming that the 'Head approach is solely about metallic fury. Inevitably, much of this comes from frontman Ian 'Lemmy' Kilmister, whose love of 1950s rock'n'roll and 1960s beat-era sounds profundly informs his songs, alongside a hefty dose of 1970s punk. As he told me in 1999 ''The Beatles are my biggest influence, as well as Little Richard and early Elvis. And the Ramones, too- they understood rock'n'roll. You hear the chord progressions and the solos: they must have been great rock'n'roll fans when they were kids. I heard myself in them, and they heard themselves in me.'' This love of classic music is what gives Motorhead their unique edge, and fills this career-spanning compilation with the songs that will stay with you long after the first listen. Although the bands public image is founded on Lemmy's famous intake of Jack Daniels and speed, the trio's incessant touring, their eternal appetite for life on the road and the eardrum-shredding volume of their shows, these disguise the musicians' awe-inspiring mastery of their art. Lemmy will tour until he drops- and when that happens, the global music scene will be greatly diminished. So raise a glass of bourbon, toast the great man and play the filthy, beautiful, sweaty songs on this album - in his own words- 'One More Fucking Time'.
