From Britian's darkest and finest hour to the great alliance and ultimate victory, the Second World War remains the pivotal event in our century. Churchill was not only its greatest leader, but the free world's most eloquent voice of defiance in the face of Nazi tyranny. His epic account of those times, published in six volumes, won the Nobel Prize in 1953.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 4736 pages\n    * Publisher: Mariner Books (May 9, 1986)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 039541685X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0395416853","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4426a8a07a2e1339e6a4c9dc04c2bd85dc9acc10","amp;dn":"Winstone+S.Churchill%2CThe+Second+World+War+%286+Vols%29%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4426a8a07a2e1339e6a4c9dc04c2bd85dc9acc10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,38,168,160,122,46,19,57,230,164,201,220,4,194,189,133,220,154,204,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
