In    :\n : Iron Curtain, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anne Applebaum describes   :\n : how the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe were created and what daily    :\n : life was like once they were complete. She draws on newly opened East      :\n : European archives, interviews, and personal accounts translated for the    :\n : first time to portray in devastating detail the dilemmas faced by millions :\n : of individuals trying to adjust to a way of life that challenged their     :\n : every belief and took away everything they had accumulated. Today the      :\n : Soviet Bloc is a lost civilization, one whose cruelty, paranoia, bizarre   :\n : morality, and strange aesthetics Applebaum captures in the electrifying    :\n : pages of Iron Curtain.                                                     :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a1315ea566b198d82b5d0b4a494bc59e6940a40","amp;dn":"Iron+Curtain+The+Crushing+of+Eastern+Europe+1944-1956+2012+Retai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a1315ea566b198d82b5d0b4a494bc59e6940a40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,19,21,234,86,107,25,141,130,181,208,180,164,148,188,89,230,148,10,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
