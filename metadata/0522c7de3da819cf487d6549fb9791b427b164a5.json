It was published by Random House in 1986 and became a New York Times non-fiction bestseller.\r\n\r\nBurnett spent her childhood in a Depression-scarred Hollywood neighborhood, where she lived in a dingy single-room apartment with her grandmother, a hypochondriac devoted to Christian Science. The child of alcoholic parents - a mother who fantasized about success in Tinseltown and a father who eventually was committed to a public sanatorium - she constantly daydreamed about a show business career while at the same time realizing the odds of achieving one were very much against her, until a mysterious benefactor financed her move to New York City. In this book, she presents a coming of age tale that's humorous, heartbreaking, and hopeful.\r\n\r\nThe book served as the basis for the play Hollywood Arms, which Burnett co-wrote with her daughter Carrie Hamilton.\r\n\r\nLength: 1.5 hours\r\n \nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/654101.One_More_Time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0522c7de3da819cf487d6549fb9791b427b164a5","amp;dn":"One+More+Time+-+Carol+Burnett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0522c7de3da819cf487d6549fb9791b427b164a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,34,199,222,61,168,25,207,72,125,101,73,251,151,145,180,39,177,100,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
