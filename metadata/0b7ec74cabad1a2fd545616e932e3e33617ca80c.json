The prize was overseen by the Board of Longitude, comprising the scientific, political and naval leaders of the day.\n\nA range of possible methods were developed with the Board of Longitude's support, but Yorkshire clockmaker John Harrison was the biggest winner with his marine chronometer clock, which enabled ships accurately and reliably to determine their longitude, avoiding potential shipwreck and enabling Britain's global trade to flourish.\n\nHorizon explores six potential challenges nominated by a new Longitude Committee, and launches a vote to determine which should be put forward as the new Longitude prize. The question is 'if you had Ã‚Â£10 million to make one change to the world, what would you do?'\n\nProfessor Alice Roberts hosts the episode from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, examining the history of the Longitude prize, and the ambition and rationale behind the project. The programme also features Prof Alice Roberts, Michael Mosley, Liz Bonnin, Prof Iain Stewart, Dr Helen Czerski, Dr Kevin Fong and Dr Saleyha Ahsan examining each of the six nominated challenges in detail.\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bef3dfd7d0fef28d908e&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo: Bitrate: 1510 Kbps\nVideo: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo: Resolution: 832 x 468\nAudio: Codec: AAC LC \nAudio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio: Channels: stereo (2/0) \nAudio: English \nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25fps\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 694MB\nContainer: Mp4\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b044mkxt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b044mkxt&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7ec74cabad1a2fd545616e932e3e33617ca80c","amp;dn":"BBC.Horizon.2014.The.10.Million.Challenge.PDTV.XviD.AC3..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7ec74cabad1a2fd545616e932e3e33617ca80c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,126,199,76,171,173,26,47,213,69,97,110,147,46,62,51,97,124,168,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
