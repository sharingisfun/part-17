There are gorgeous tunes hiding everywhere.&quot; - Guardian\n&quot;An aural phantasmagoria - funky, playful but sinister like the best childrens stories.&quot; - Mojo\n&quot;An honest overview of the fact that it never really is all about the music, even when the music's this exciting.&quot; - NME\n&quot;Stuffed with tunes... big statements that you can whistle.&quot; - Q\n&quot;A front runner for album of the year.&quot; - The Sun\n&quot;It's a constantly appealing, pop-cultural riot.&quot; - The Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:767eba8cf834541ca954dc7f70e4d22dc3add356","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+Demon+Days+%282005%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"767eba8cf834541ca954dc7f70e4d22dc3add356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,126,186,140,248,52,84,28,169,84,220,127,112,228,210,45,195,173,211,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
