It all began in 2012 when Yoodoo started recording his creations in his garage. Fast forward to today and GRMLN is gearing up to release a debut EP, Explore, on October 23Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ all while still in college!\n\nGRMLNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Coral,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pretty self-explanatory. You can easily pick up on the SoCal influence and the chilled out atmosphere that this track projects. The jangly guitars, smooth pop bass, and shuffling beat all lay out the perfect basis for the breezy vocals that accompany the instrumentals. This is the type of song you put on when you just want to forget about everything.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indieshuffle.com/grmln-coral/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indieshuffle.com/grmln-coral/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d1c60b2adae5b498acfcfe56791bc6ef8beeb0b","amp;dn":"GRMLN+-+Explore+EP+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d1c60b2adae5b498acfcfe56791bc6ef8beeb0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,28,96,178,173,174,91,73,138,207,207,229,103,145,188,110,248,190,235,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
