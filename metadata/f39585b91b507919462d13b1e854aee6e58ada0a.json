There is even a GURPS Ogre splatbook to familiarize you with the background and the OGREverse.Everything is print-and-play. There is also a VASSAL module inside, to play through the net. \nThe rules are elegant and streamlined, simple enough to be learned by a 10 year-old, yet the game has a lot of tactical and strategic depth.\nSo go ahead, read the rulebook and play this jewel of a game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39585b91b507919462d13b1e854aee6e58ada0a","amp;dn":"OGRE%2FGEV+print+and+play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39585b91b507919462d13b1e854aee6e58ada0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,149,133,185,27,80,121,25,70,45,19,177,232,84,174,230,229,138,218,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
