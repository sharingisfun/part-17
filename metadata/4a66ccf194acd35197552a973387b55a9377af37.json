God\nappears to Jeremiah in different human guises on several occasions, and makes it clear to him that he has been selected\nto announce God's message to the people of Jerusalem: a mighty ruler from the north will attack the Kingdom of Judah if\nthe people there continue to worship false idols, and fail to remember the One God. No-one in Anathoth believes\nJeremiah's prophecy, however. Instead, he is accused of blasphemy and is physically attacked - and not even his family\ncomes to his aid. Nevertheless, with the help of Baruch, a temple scribe who hears Jeremiah's first sermon and becomes\nhis disciple, Jeremiah succeeds in announcing the word of God. The prophet's message of impending doom incurs only the\nwrath and rejection of the ruling classes, the priesthood and the King. Jeremiah can find no audience, and lands up in\ncaptivity again - but even though he even has to leave his true love for Judith to fate, he still sticks firmly to his\nmission. It is only when war with the enemy forces from Babylon seems inevitable that the people of Jerusalem start to\ngrow restless, and Jeremiah gradually starts to win support. However the King, who is taking the advice of the false\nprophet Hananiah, is certain that the country's powerful neighbours, the Egyptians, will come to his assistance. Shortly\nafterwards, however, the Babylonians lay siege to the Holy City. Although the King now believes Jeremiah, he still finds\nit impossible to make the decision to surrender the city. Jerusalem goes up in flames, and the people are led off into\nexile in Babylon. \n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nCompression: No\nMovie Quality: DVD9\nSize:5985\nMb\nLanguages:Italian Ac3 2.0\nColors\nRuntime:90 min.\nAspect ratio:4:3\nSubtitles:Italian N.U.\nMenu:SÃƒÂ¬\nExtra:Backstage, Essential Filmographies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a66ccf194acd35197552a973387b55a9377af37","amp;dn":"Geremia+-+Il+Profeta+%281998%29+%5BDVD9+-+Ita+2.0%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a66ccf194acd35197552a973387b55a9377af37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,102,204,241,148,172,211,81,151,85,42,151,51,135,181,90,147,119,175,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
