The duo released its first album, The Belle Brigade, in 2011 to positive critical response.\n\n\nThe Belle Brigade's music, marked by harmonies reminiscent of The Everly Brothers and Simon &amp; Garfunkel, has been described as having roots in the classic California pop rock and country sounds of groups like Fleetwood Mac and The Flying Burrito Brothers[9] as well as The Beatles.[10] Ethan Gruska has said that their strongest influence is Paul Simon's solo work.[11]\n\nTheir debut album has received critical attention and praise. Los Angeles Times music writer Randall Roberts described their album as &quot;a dozen California pop gems&quot; and said of their first single, &quot;Losers&quot;: &quot;A defiant, classically structured song about being sick of social games, pretense and irony, &quot;Losers&quot; feels like one of those works of alienation that's existed forever, one that would ring true just as clearly had it been released in 1957 or 1974.&quot; L.A. Times record reviewer Mikael Wood called the album &quot;the sound of a record nerdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dream come to messy, muscular life.&quot; Newsday critic Glenn Gamboa referred to their &quot;doe-eyed innocence . . . that makes their sun-kissed '70s SoCal sound even more appealing.&quot; Paste reviewer Alexandra Fletcher listed their song &quot;Where Not to Look for Freedom&quot; as one of her &quot;10 New Songs For The 2011 Summer&quot;. And El Paso Times reviewer Doug Pullen called the album &quot;charming, compelling, timeless and inspiringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and worthy of repeated listening&quot; and said it was his &quot;favorite album this year.&quot;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belle_Brigade&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belle_Brigade&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
