Mark is also regularly called upon to present a radio show on Christmas Day and it is the R&amp;B, blues, doo wop and jazz element of that show that is reflected in this selection of favourites drawn from his own collection.\n\nThe RavensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ''White Christmas'' and Mabel ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ''Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' reached #9 and #12 respectively on the R&amp;B chart over the 1948 Christmas holiday period; Felix GrossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ''Love For Christmas'' and The OrioleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ''What Are You Doing New YearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eve?'' both peaked at #9 a year later; and ''Far Away Blues (Xmas Blues)'', which featured Little Esther and Mel Walker singing with the Johnny Otis Orchestra, was a #6 hit in 1950. The remainder of MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s selection is a mixture of familiar names (The Moonglows, Joe Turner, Jimmy Witherspoon, LightninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Hopkins and Louis Armstrong, among others) and a smattering of less well known artists, all conspiring to make your seasonal holiday a Rhythm &amp; Blues Christmas to remember.\n\n&quot;There's nary a duffer among the 25 tracks...doused in the good-time party spirit.&quot; - 4/5  RECORD COLLECTOR\n\n&quot;For fans of 50s R&amp;B - whether you dig holiday music at all, even a little bit - this one is essential.
