However, as JavaScript applications become more complicated, testing and applying sustainable software engineering practices also become mandatory.\n\nJasmine JavaScript Testing is a practical guide to a more sustainable JavaScript development process. You will learn by example how to drive the development of a web application using tests and best practices.\n\nThis book is about becoming a better JavaScript developer. So, throughout the chapters, you will not only learn about writing tests, but also about the best practices for writing software in the JavaScript language. This book is about acknowledging JavaScript as a real platform for application development and leveraging all of its potential. You will also learn about tooling and automation and how to make your life easier and more productive.\n\nYou will learn how to create a sustainable codebase with the help of Jasmine. We will take a look at integrated testing (with a backend NodeJS server) and how you can speed this process up by faking AJAX requests. As you progress through the book, you will learn about the challenges of testing an application built on top of a framework and how you can prevent your application from suffering from dependency management hell. Also, since your applications need to get into production, you will learn about optimizing the code to reduce the number of requests the browser needs to make while loading your application.\n\nWith this book, you will learn everything you need to know to become a real professional in the ever-demanding JavaScript universe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fb9d998a155ab51c1c5815d05789c8153018a3b","amp;dn":"Jasmine+JavaScript+Testing+%28PDF%2C+EPUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fb9d998a155ab51c1c5815d05789c8153018a3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,185,217,152,161,85,171,81,193,197,129,93,5,120,156,129,83,1,138,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
