There seemed to be some\ndesire to have the PCM source of the SBD used for the matrix, so here\nit is.  Both sources are digital making the synching rather easy.  I\nremoved a few baloon pops in the AUD.  Light Waves L2 was used for \nlimiting (-0.7 threshold), and no EQ or other processing was employed.\n\nOne of the favorite shows I attended - the crowd freaked on the\nHey Jude rezi.  Loser - Dupree's, and Shakedown -&gt; Fingers were great\nJerry suites.\n\nThanks to Charlie Miller for the PCM source on the SBD, and to Doug and\nJim Oade for recording the AUD - a great combination!\n\nEnjoy!\n-Chappy\n\n********Jerry supposedly wouldn't go onstage till his heroin dealer arrived***********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc192bc57a7c8da2a8704f0737a939d8060736b0","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1985-09-07+-+Red+Rocks+Amp+in+Morrison%2C+CO++MATR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc192bc57a7c8da2a8704f0737a939d8060736b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,25,43,197,122,124,141,162,168,112,79,7,55,169,57,216,6,7,54,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
