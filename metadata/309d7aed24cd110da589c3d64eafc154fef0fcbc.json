Krebs, Jr. \n\nThe discoverer of Laetrile presents a biochemist's view of the origin of \ncancer and how nature attempts to control it with a substance called \namygdalin. When it is purified and concentrated for cancer therapy, it is \ncalled Laetrile. A classic. 60-min. audio.\n\n\nMPEG 2.5 layer 3\n16kbit\n11025Hz Mono\nCRCs: No\n\n58m07s\n\nI ripped this from a tape over line-in and normalized the two sides of the\ntape.  I then increased the volume of the questions at the end and broke\nthe speech up into logical sections.  There are a few minor hiccups and\npops, but I think it came across very clean.\n\nG. Edward Griffin is planning to release his audio archives in CD format,\nand he now allows copying of his audio.  When they get released to CD I \nsuggest buying them, or in some way supporting him and others like him in\ngetting pertinent information out to the people.\n\nwww.realityzone.com &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.realityzone.com/controlcancer.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.realityzone.com/controlcancer.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.realityzone.com/audarprog.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.realityzone.com/audarprog.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309d7aed24cd110da589c3d64eafc154fef0fcbc","amp;dn":"A+Control+For+Cancer+-+Dr.+Ernst+T.+Krebs+Speech+-+Vitamin+B17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309d7aed24cd110da589c3d64eafc154fef0fcbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,157,122,237,36,205,17,13,165,137,195,214,78,175,193,84,254,240,252,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
