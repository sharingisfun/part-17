His magnum opus is this book &quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot;, where he documents his assertion that Fascism is the society of the future. \n\nThe dregs of society, which marxism so passionately holds dear, will not come to power, nor ever succeed in destroying the White Race. Instead Managerial Fascism will surpass the encumbered by its own deadlock capitalist society and lead the People to progress and prosperity. \n\n14/88","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ce1d1541fb32ab7d42d2a6a907db5d6210e07b","amp;dn":"The+Managerial+Revolution+by+James+Burnham.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ce1d1541fb32ab7d42d2a6a907db5d6210e07b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,206,29,21,65,251,50,171,125,66,210,166,169,7,219,93,98,16,224,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
