In turns haunting, desolate, hypnotic and euphoric, its centre-piece is the title track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a stunning 55-minute musical statement that breaks down into 14 separate and often diverse (though interlinked) vignettes. \n\nThe tale begins slowly with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“OccamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s RazorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, gaining momentum and intensity with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Blind House,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Drawing The LineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The IncidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ itself, though the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masterful manipulation of sounds and textures is never overlooked. The mellowness of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Yellow Windows Of The Evening Train,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for instance, is accompanied by the gentle crackle of a needle on vinyl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ for all his skill as a producer and remixer, Wilson is a staunch supporter of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“oldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ways of listening to music. Incorporating both of these styles, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Octane TwistedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ somehow batters and seduces simultaneously, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I Drive The Hearse,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ further sweetened by an uplifting guitar climax, is an intoxicating slice of melancholy with which to book-end the recordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 14-piece song cycle. \n\nThe seeds of the idea that led to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The IncidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ came to Steven Wilson as he became caught up in a motorway traffic jam whilst driving past a road accident. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere was a sign saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“POLICE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ INCIDENTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and everyone was slowing down to rubber neck what had happened,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he recalls. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAfterwards, it struck me that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“incidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is a very detached word for something so destructive and traumatic for the people involvedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Additionally, Wilson delved back into incidents in his own life that had profound affected him, including a lost childhood friendship, a sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ance, his first love, and the day that he decided to give up secure employment to follow his dream of making music. The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epic song, an 11-minute Pink Floyd-flavoured masterpiece called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Time FliesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, for instance, begins with the line: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI was born in 1967.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The IncidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is completed by four standalone compositions all housed on a separate CD to stress their independence from the recordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main 14-part suite.\n\n\nAbout the limited edition:\n&quot;It's a piece of art...not some files or some functional CD in a bland crystal case...For me, the deluxe edition is a way of making music something people will want to cherish, own and treasure like they would a beautiful painting.&quot; Steven Wilson.\n\n\nThe BOX and the pictures are really cool. A true collector's item and highly recommended to grab one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbac2563e28fc799471481fa2d2a7dfccf787a95","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree+-+The+Incident+%28LTD.+EDITION%29+%5BSURROUND+DVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbac2563e28fc799471481fa2d2a7dfccf787a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,172,37,99,226,143,199,153,71,20,129,250,45,42,125,252,207,120,122,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
