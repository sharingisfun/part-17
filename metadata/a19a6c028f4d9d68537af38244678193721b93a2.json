Powered by the human capital of 1.3 billion citizens, the latest technological advances, and a comparatively efficient system of state-directed capitalism, China seems poised to become the global superpower this century. But the Middle Kingdom also faces a series of challenges. From energy scarcity to environmental degradation to political unrest and growing global security burdens, a host of factors could derail ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global ascent.\nIn this edition of The Munk Debates Ã¢â‚¬â€ CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier international debate series Ã¢â‚¬â€ former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and CNNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fareed Zakaria square off against leading historian Niall Ferguson and world-renowned Chinese economist David Daokui Li to debate the biggest geopolitical issue of our time: Does the 21st century belong to China?\nHighly electrifying and thoroughly engrossing, the Munk Debate on China is the first formal public debate Dr. Kissinger has participated in on ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future, and this volume includes exclusive interviews with Kissinger and Li.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Does-21st-Century-Belong-China/dp/1770890629&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Does-21st-Century-Belong-China/dp/1770890629&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a19a6c028f4d9d68537af38244678193721b93a2","amp;dn":"Does+the+21st+Century+Belong+to+China%3F%3A+The+Munk+Debate+on+China","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a19a6c028f4d9d68537af38244678193721b93a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,154,108,2,143,77,157,104,83,122,243,130,68,103,129,147,114,27,147,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
