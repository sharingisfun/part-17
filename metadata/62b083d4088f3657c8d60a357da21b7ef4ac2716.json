A young backpacker toured the continent. Then one night, as he climbed into bed in his hotel room after a long dusty bus ride, he was stung by a scorpion. For weeks he was hovering between life and death, hospitalized at a local infirmary, finally, thanks to intensive medical care, he recovered and returned - to life and to home.\nBased on this extra ordinary story, bliss launched themselves into a fascinating musical adventure: the journey of AFTERLIFE. The highly acclaimed debut concept album &quot;Afterlife&quot; set new standards for ethnic lounge music when it was released in 2001 and sold more than 15.000 copies in Denmark alone. The musical world of BLISS is deeply rooted in a fine mix of western, African and classical musical influences representing the vast musical backgrounds of all four members respectively.\nIt also showcases an undercurrent of warm melancholy that is hard to describe in words... The album includes the first single from BLISS called &quot;LONG LIFE&quot; which was single of the week on national radio in Denmark as well as a complete new track &quot;LENTO&quot;.\n\n Tracks\n1.
