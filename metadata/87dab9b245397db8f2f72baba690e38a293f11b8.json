Pepper. Hits included &quot;If You Let Me Stay,&quot; &quot;Dance Little Sister,&quot; &quot;Sign Your Name,&quot; and the number one &quot;Wishing Well.&quot; His first album is a curious mixture of old and new styles. Although the production is quite modern, d'Arby shows his roots in the work of older artists, borrowing a page or two from Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, while James Brown appears to have had the strongest influence on d'Arby's stage presence. ~ \n \nWikipedia  - Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby was Terence Trent D'Arby's debut album. It was released in July 1987 on Columbia Records, and became an instant number-one smash in the UK, selling a million copies within the first three days of going on sale. The album was a slow-building success in the U.S. upon its release there in October, eventually peaking at number four on May 7, 1988  in the same week that the single &quot;Wishing Well&quot; hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Other singles from the album included &quot;If You Let Me Stay&quot;, which was a top ten hit in the UK, and &quot;Sign Your Name&quot;, which reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Known for controversial statements, D'Arby declared the album superior to The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The ploy worked, and Introducing the Hardline soared to the top of the UK charts.\n\n Martin Johnson, Barnes &amp; Noble - Elements of Otis Redding, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Sam Cooke, abound in this astonishing 1987 debut recording. But what's more impressive is that they are delivered with the passion of an artist rather than a revivalist. TTD is proud of his influences, but he owns them rather than vice versa and the result is a deeply soulful and diverse recording. &quot;Dance Little Sister,&quot; rocks furiously, &quot;Sign Your Name,&quot; is exquisitely delicate and &quot;Wishing Well,&quot; features extraordinary songcraft. Unfortunately D'Arby got lost in the swell of accolades following his debut. His second recording was a mishmash, and by the time he returned to form with Symphony or Dawn and Vibrator, his constituency had stopped paying attention. Still, he's the first of a long line of soul rebels who invigorated R&amp;B and pop during the late '80s and early '90s. \n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] If You All Get To Heaven\n[02] If You Let Me Stay\n[03] Wishing Well\n[04] I'll Never Turn My Back On You (Father's Words)\n[05] Dance Little Sister\n[06] Seven More Days\n[07] Let's Go Forward\n[08] Rain\n[09] Sign Your Name\n[10] As Yet Untitled\n[11] Who's Lovin' You\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t---&gt; 00h:47m:08s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t---&gt; 120mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t---&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t---&gt; I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t---&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t---&gt; 13 July 1987 [UK] 05 October 1987 [US]\n\nRecord Company\t\t---&gt; CBS Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t---&gt; http://www.sanandamaitreya.com\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87dab9b245397db8f2f72baba690e38a293f11b8","amp;dn":"%5B1987%5D+Introducing+The+Hardline+According+To+-+Terence+Trent+DAr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87dab9b245397db8f2f72baba690e38a293f11b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,218,185,178,69,57,125,184,242,247,43,171,166,144,227,138,41,63,17,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
