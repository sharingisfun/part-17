Hopefully making this torrent will increase the popularity of this album, and build support for Curled-Coil to create more great trance music.\n\nThe track &quot;5 in threes&quot; is so dang eclectic and peaceful, it's one of those tracks that can just let you flip off your brain and relax. Really reminds me of something MAYA AKAI would make. &quot;more power to you&quot; is pretty nice too, sampling the only line that matters from Hixxy's &quot;More and More&quot;. \n\nWhile not god-tier, the album is a sure-step ahead of the rest of the crap floating across the rancid seas of modern music.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nTAGS:\ntrance, progressive, house, electronic, dance, music, jcore, doujin, indie, comiket, 79, curled, coil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9c53a5ca2c4aa27e45dc7f5363f98f6287399b","amp;dn":"Curled-Coil+-+Subsequence+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BCURC-0005%5D+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9c53a5ca2c4aa27e45dc7f5363f98f6287399b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,156,83,165,202,44,74,162,126,69,220,127,83,99,249,143,98,135,57,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
