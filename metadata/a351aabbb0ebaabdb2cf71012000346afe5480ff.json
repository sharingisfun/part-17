What better way to reward fans of all things downtempo and chilled out than to lend their record boxes to one of the genre's most potent and respected series? As a look into the influences behind Simple Things, it's illuminating; every song sounds like it could have been playing on a corner jukebox while they were making the album. From the DJ Shadow-esque &quot;Channel Suite 1&quot; by the Cinematic Orchestra to the Stylistics' trippy nursery version of &quot;People Make the World Go Round,&quot; this is music to simultaneously open your heart and nod your head to.\n\nNOTE:\nTHIS ALBUM DOES NOT CONSIST OF ZERO 7 SONGS, BUT RATHER SET OF SONGS MIXED BY ZERO 7 THAT INFLUENCED THEIR SOUND.\n\nTracklist:\n\n 1.
