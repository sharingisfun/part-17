When burning to CD, be sure to set your CD-burner to &quot;disc-at-once&quot; (usually found in Preferences). Otherwise a two-second gap will be inserted between tracks, ruining the effect.\n===============================================================================\n\nFrom the allmusic review (4.5/5 stars):\n\n&quot;Sioux's singing is some of her best both in and out of the Banshees, still retaining the shadowed mystery that she makes her own while drawing on an interesting range of styles, from cabaret to Nico-esque chanting. Budgie, meanwhile, continues to demonstrate why he's such a fantastic drummer and percussionist, from tribal stomps to lighter bell, marimba, steel drum, and other combinations, even a few electronic loops for good measure.&quot;\n\nRipped with Exact Audio Copy v0.99b, in lossless FLAC format.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
