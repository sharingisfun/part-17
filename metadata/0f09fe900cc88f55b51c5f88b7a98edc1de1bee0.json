Several demonstrations illustrate the addition of different colors of light. Finally, the colors of everyday things such as the sky, sunset, and ocean are discussed. Segment length: 40 minutes\n\n    Reflection and Refraction: Mirrored and diffuse reflection are compared. Refraction is demonstrated using a water tank. The concepts of total internal reflection and light dispersion are discussed, leading to a demonstration of properties of a rainbow. Segment length: 41 minutes\n\n    Light Waves: The interference of light waves is demonstrated with laser light, and related to the colors of thin films. A discussion on polarization is illustrated using polarizing material. Segment length: 30 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f09fe900cc88f55b51c5f88b7a98edc1de1bee0","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Physics+Alive%21+-+Volume+9+-+Light+%26amp%3B+Color%2C+Reflec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f09fe900cc88f55b51c5f88b7a98edc1de1bee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,9,254,144,12,200,143,85,181,28,95,136,183,169,142,220,29,225,190,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
