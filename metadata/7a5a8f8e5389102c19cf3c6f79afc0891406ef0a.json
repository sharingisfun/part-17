Got your FPL card?\n_____________________________________________________\n\nFrom RecordedBooks.com:\n\nDave Eggers scored a worldwide phenomenon with this memoir \nthat topped national best-seller lists and has since become \na staple for summer reading and book clubs. A compelling \nvoice for Generation X, Eggers here recounts his early 20s, \ncaring for his younger brother after their parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ \nunexpected deaths and his endeavors in a variety of media.\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nThe book was an enormous commercial and critical success, \nreaching number one on The New York Times bestseller list \nand being nominated as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize \nfor General Non-Fiction. Time Magazine and several \nnewspapers dubbed it &quot;The Best Book of the Year.&quot; Critics \npraised the book for its wild, vibrant prose, and it was \ndescribed as &quot;big, daring [and] manic-depressive&quot; by The \nNew York Times. The book was chosen as the 12th best book \nof the decade by The Times.\n\n\nFrom AuiofileMagazine.com:\n\nWhen the author's parents die of cancer within five weeks \nof each other during his senior year of college, he finds \nhimself the guardian of his younger brother. They move \nfrom Chicago to California, and the culture shock provides \nthe impetus for this memoir. Narrator Dion Graham has a \ndeep voice that is both riveting and unsettling. His \nperformance harkens back to the days of the Beat Poets by \ntransforming the words on a page into a vibrant experience \ncomplete with character voices, rhythmic paragraphs, and \nasides that sound like run-on sentences but are actually \nthoughts and feelings and jokes and, well, life. It's a \ntour de force for Graham and Eggers, and a golden \nopportunity for listeners everywhere.\n\nWinner of AudioFile Earphones Award, 2010\nPulitzer Prize Finalist","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5a8f8e5389102c19cf3c6f79afc0891406ef0a","amp;dn":"A+HEARTBREAKING+WORK+OF+STAGGERING+GENIUS+-+Eggers+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5a8f8e5389102c19cf3c6f79afc0891406ef0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,90,143,142,83,137,16,44,25,207,60,111,121,175,192,137,20,6,239,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
