Lial, John Hornsby, Terry McGinnis\n\n(cover picture here: http://pixpipeline.com/d/1427b03262eb.jpg)\n\nISBN-13: 978-0-321-55764-3\nISBN-10:     0-321-55764-6\n\nPDF eBook\nEnglish\n\nThis is a textbook used in many Intermediate Algebra classes.\n\nI couldn't find this in PDF anywhere for my class so I bit the bullet, bought the book (along with the online access, together over $170 new!) and painstakingly converted the online book to PDF (which required making a macro to print each page to PDF, piecing it all together, and added all the relevant chapter marks and made the table of contents clickable).\n\nI really hope all my efforts become a huge cost-saver for the college community.  By not spending the ridiculous prices on these books maybe we can start actually focusing on school and making the world a better place.\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED, this book will be valuable to many students!\n\n - MisterBigg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000baea55bc552b437100bb3fd8c196c9b89a655","amp;dn":"Intermediate+Algebra%3A+Tenth+Edition+%5BeBook%5D+%5BEnglish%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000baea55bc552b437100bb3fd8c196c9b89a655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,11,174,165,91,197,82,180,55,16,11,179,253,140,25,108,155,137,166,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
