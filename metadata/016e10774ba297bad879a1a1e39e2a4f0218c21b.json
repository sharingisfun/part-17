The movie is about a green sea turtle who is hatched in 1959 and spends the next 50 years travelling the world while it is being changed by relentless whale and shark fishing, pollution and global warming. Hours after being hatched, Sammy (voice of Yuri Lowenthal) finds and loses the love of his life, a pretty hatchling called Shelly (Isabelle Fuhrman of Orphan fame).\n\nOn the epic journey across the oceans that all turtles must accomplish before returning to the beach where they were born, Sammy dodges every danger in the hope of meeting Shelly again. On the way, he also has encounters with humans, both good and bad, as well as toothy sharks and piranhas.\n\nIt is easy to root for Sammy and his pals not only because they are cute but also because they are sporting and gutsy. With its story spanning over 50 years, Stassen marks the milestone periods with human events (like the hippies of the Sixties and the Greenpeace protests) and with classic songs on the soundtrack. Of course, the Beatles are represented with their hit, \\\\\\'Across The Universe\\\\\\' (what else?).\n\nIt is an entertaining sea-world documentary for the kids.\n\nSCREENS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img508.imageshack.us/img508/3936/vlcsnap10069.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img508.imageshack.us/img508/3936/vlcsnap10069.png&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://img529.imageshack.us/img529/5848/vlcsnap10409.png\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/8487/vlcsnap10498.png\nhttp://img293.imageshack.us/img293/346/vlcsnap10652.png\n\n\nSeed and enjoy folks!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:016e10774ba297bad879a1a1e39e2a4f0218c21b","amp;dn":"A+Turtles+Tale+Sammys+Adventure+2010+LiMITED+DVDSCR+XViD-HLS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"016e10774ba297bad879a1a1e39e2a4f0218c21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,110,16,119,75,162,151,186,216,121,161,161,227,158,42,79,2,24,194,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
