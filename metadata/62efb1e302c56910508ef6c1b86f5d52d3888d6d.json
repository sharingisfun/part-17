M. Forster's classic 1910 novel shows in careful detail the injuriously rigid British class consciousness of the early 20th century. The film's catalyst is &quot;poor relation&quot; Margaret Schlegel (Emma Thompson), who inherits part of the estate of Ruth Wilcox (Vanessa Redgrave), an upper-class woman whom she had befriended. The film's principal characters are divided by caste: aristocratic industrial Henry Wilcox (Anthony Hopkins); middle-echelon Margaret and her sister Helen (Helena Bonham Carter); and working-class clerk Leonard Bast (Sam West) and his wife (Nicola Duffett). The personal and social conflicts among these characters ultimately result in tragedy for Bast and disgrace for Wilcox, but the film's wider theme remains the need, in the words of the novel's famous epigram, to &quot;only connect&quot; with other people, despite boundaries of gender, class, or petty grievance. Filmed on a proudly modest budget, Howards End offers sets, spectacles, and costumes as lavish as in any historical epic. Nominated for 9 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, the film took home awards for Thompson as Best Actress, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's adapted screenplay, and Luciana Arrighi's art direction. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Howards End.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.61 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1614 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.6 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 1226 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.292\n      StreamSize : 1.22 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 22mn\n      Bit rate : 382 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 389 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0104454\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by ggoes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62efb1e302c56910508ef6c1b86f5d52d3888d6d","amp;dn":"James+Ivory+-+Howards+End+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62efb1e302c56910508ef6c1b86f5d52d3888d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,239,177,227,2,197,105,16,80,142,246,193,184,111,93,82,211,136,141,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
