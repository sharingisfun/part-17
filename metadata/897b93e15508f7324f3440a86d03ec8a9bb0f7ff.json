Now his plans to retire from the trade and live a quiet life of domesticity are threatened when an officer of Scotland Yard gets the goods on him. Inspector Becker uses the evidence he's found on Lassiter to bribe the thief into performing one last job, a jewel heist. The perils he faces breaking into the German embassy match the treachery of the Scotland Yard inspector, and soon Nick is caught between the Devil and the deep blue sea.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:897b93e15508f7324f3440a86d03ec8a9bb0f7ff","amp;dn":"Lassiter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"897b93e15508f7324f3440a86d03ec8a9bb0f7ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,123,147,225,85,8,247,50,79,52,64,168,109,3,236,138,155,176,247,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
