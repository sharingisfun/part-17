The album followed\nthe same raw heavy metal direction of their debut,\nand was even more consistent from a songwriting and\nperformance standpoint. Several of Twisted Sister's\nbest anthems reside here -- the title track (which\nwas one of the band's first videos to be aired on\nMTV), as well as &quot;The Kids Are Back,&quot; &quot;We're Gonna\nMake It,&quot; and &quot;I Am (I'm Me).&quot; But besides a ballad\nthat vocalist Dee Snider wrote especially for his\nwife, &quot;You're Not Alone (Suzette's Song),&quot; the\nalbum is comprised of 100 percent heavy metal --\n&quot;Like a Knife in the Back,&quot; &quot;Ride to Live, Live to\nRide,&quot; &quot;I've Had Enough,&quot; and &quot;I'll Take You\nAlive.&quot; The 1999 CD reissue included three bonus\ntracks not included on the original: &quot;One Man\nWoman,&quot; &quot;Four Barrel Heart of Love,&quot; and &quot;Feel the\nPower.&quot; Eventually certified gold in the U.S., You\nCan't Stop Rock &amp; Roll set the stage perfectly for\ntheir next release, 1984's breakthrough Stay\nHungry.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586f2172b4cf3518b4b32db28963e65f0b06d2d4","amp;dn":"Twisted+Sister-You+Cant+Stop+Rockn+Roll+%28Reissue+2006%29-Hard+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586f2172b4cf3518b4b32db28963e65f0b06d2d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,111,33,114,180,207,53,24,180,179,45,178,137,99,230,95,11,6,210,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
