Unbeknownst to Stigman, Trench is an undercover DEA agent and reports to his superior, Jessup (Robert John Burke), that he failed to acquire cocaine from Greco that they could use as evidence to convict him. Against Jessup's orders, Trench decides to remain undercover and assist Stigman in robbing $3 million from Greco, so they can prosecute Greco for money laundering. Trench later meets with his lover, Deb Rees (Paula Patton), who is involved with another man as well, while Stigman, an undercover Naval Intelligence Officer, meets with his commanding officer, Harold Quince (James Marsden), who instructs Stigman to kill Trench so the Navy can use the stolen money to fund covert operations.\n\nTrench and Stigman are surprised to find $43 million (rather than $3 million) in the vault. After the heist, Stigman follows orders to betray Trench and escapes with the money, although he lets Trench live. Upon learning of this, Quince attempts to have Stigman killed, but Stigman escapes after learning the money will be transferred to a Navy base in Corpus Christi. Meanwhile, Earl (Bill Paxton) aggressively interrogates the bank manager about the money Trench and Stigman stole from him.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e354c5b499fc28d4ab708b43653792f1b613374","amp;dn":"2+GUNS+TSCam+NoLOGO+CamAngleCorrected.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e354c5b499fc28d4ab708b43653792f1b613374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,53,76,91,73,159,194,141,74,183,8,180,54,83,121,47,27,97,51,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
