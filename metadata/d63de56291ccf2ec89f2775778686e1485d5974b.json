FUNKENSTEIN furthers George Clinton's conceptual and musical master plan to funkify the world. THE CLONES unravels the Funk Mob's cosmology and populates it with a cast of mythological characters that includes Starchild (introduced on MOTHERSHIP) and the Funk overlord himself, Dr. Funkenstein. By this album, Parliament have almost completely moved away from the guitar-dominated psychedelic soul of their early '70s output and entrenched themselves in the realm of lighter, horn and keyboard-driven experimental dance music.\n\nWhile weakened by over-conceptualization and Parliament's sometimes too-goofy sense of humor--qualities that would seriously mar the group's later output--this disc is nonetheless full of freaky, utterly original jam-formula compositions bolstered by outstanding musicianship. &quot;Do That Stuff&quot; and &quot;I've Been Watching You&quot; are highlights. Though old school P-Funk fans may see this record as Parliament's bid for the commercial mainstream, it is still impossible to deny the unique, exuberant music within.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n01 Prelude\n02 Gamin' On Ya\n03 Dr. Funkenstein\n04 Children Of Production\n05 Getten' To Know You\n06 Do That Stuff\n07 Everything Is On The One\n08 I've Been Watching You (Move Your Sexy Body)\n09 Funkin' For Fun\n\nProduced and Conceived by George Clinton\nAll tunes published by Malbiz and Ricks Music, Inc., BMI\n\nBand lineup\nGarry Shider, Glen Goins (vocals, guitar);\nWilliam &quot;Bootsy&quot; Collins (vocals, bass, drums)\nGeorge Clinton, Calvin Simon, Fuzzy Haskins, Raymond Davis, Grady Thomas (vocals)\nMichael Hampton (guitar)\nFred Wesley, Maceo Parker, Rick Gardner, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker (horns)\nBernie Worrell (keyboards, synthesizers)\nCordell Mosson (bass)\nJerome Brailey, Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper (drums, percussion)\nDebbie Edwards, Taka Kahn (background vocals).\n\nRecorded at United Sound, Detroit, Michigan &amp; Hollywood Sound, Hollywood, California.\n\n\nRecording Procedure\nRecorded using a Linn Sondek LP12 turntable,\nOrigin Live power supply,\nLinn Ittok LVII tonearm,\nGoldring 1042 MM Cartridge,\ninto Graham Slee Gram Amp 2 Special Edition Phono Stage\nChord Cobra 3 Interconnect\nto Edirol R-09HR @ 24bit / 96kHz wav\nClick Repair wav reverse - Declick 10\nwavelab5 for track splitting\nAdobe Audition 3.0 for manual click removal - flac\n\nFlac Frontend &gt; wav\niZotope RX advanced 1.21 \nFlac Frontend - align on sector boundaries - flac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d63de56291ccf2ec89f2775778686e1485d5974b","amp;dn":"Parliament+-+The+Clones+Of+Dr.+Funkenstein+%5BVinyl%5D-MisterCee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d63de56291ccf2ec89f2775778686e1485d5974b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,61,229,98,145,204,242,236,137,242,119,87,120,104,110,20,133,213,151,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
