Blacklung is a story that lives up to the term graphic novel, that could only exist in sequential pictures - densely textured, highly stylized, delicately and boldly rendered drawings that is, taken together, wholly original.\n\nIn a night of piratical treachery when an arrogant school teacher is accidentally shanghaied aboard the frigate Hand, his fate becomes inextricably fettered to that of a sardonic gangster. Dependent on one another for survival in their strange and dangerous new home, the two form an unlikely alliance as they alternately elude or confront the thieves and cutthroats that bad luck has made their companions and captors. After an act of terrible violence, the teacher is brought before the ship's captain and instructed to use his literary skills to aid him in writing his memoirs. He is to serve as scribe for a man who, in his remaining years, has made it his mission to commit as many acts of evil as possible in order to ensure that he meet his dead wife in hell. As the captainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protected confidant, finding his only comfort in the few books afforded him, the teacher bears witness to monstrous brutality, relentless cruelty, strange wisdom, and a journey of redemption through loss of faith.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4476865ed66d7260c2768a2f6ae4d228a4a533","amp;dn":"Chris+Wright+-+Blacklung","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4476865ed66d7260c2768a2f6ae4d228a4a533","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,68,118,134,94,214,109,114,96,194,118,138,47,106,228,210,40,164,165,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
