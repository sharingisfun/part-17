This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nOne song in the countdown is a remake of Motown's first million selling hit.\n\nJohn Travolta has a song in the top ten.\n\nThe current album by one band in this countdown was certified gold on the same day it was released.\n\nOne piece of music in the countdown was written by a man who continued to write music after he became deaf.\n\nCasey remembers the artist who was listed on the Hot 100 chart continuously for more than four years.\n\n#40 Ã¢â‚¬Å“CÃ¢â‚¬â„¢MON MARIANNEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donny Osmond\n#39 Ã¢â‚¬Å“GET UP &amp; BOOGIEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Silver Convention\n#38 Ã¢â‚¬Å“STEPPINÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ OUTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Sedaka\n#37 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SARA SMILEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n#36 Ã¢â‚¬Å“ANOTHER RAINY DAY IN NEW YORK CITYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Chicago\n#35 Ã¢â‚¬Å“NEVER GONNA FALL IN LOVE AGAINÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eric Carmen\n#34 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SILLY LOVE SONGSÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wings                                        \n#33 Ã¢â‚¬Å“HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING AN ANGELÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tavares       \n#32 Ã¢â‚¬Å“A FIFTH OF BEETHOVENÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Walter Murphy &amp; The Big Apple Band\n#31 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SOMETHING HE CAN FEELÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aretha Franklin\n#30 IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢D REALLY LOVE TO SEE YOU TONIGHTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n#29 Ã¢â‚¬Å“MISTY BLUEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dorothy Moore\n#28 Ã¢â‚¬Å“BABY I LOVE YOUR WAYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Peter Frampton\n#27 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SOPHISTICATED LADYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Natalie Cole\n#26 Ã¢â‚¬Å“YOUNG HEARTS RUN FREEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Candi Staton\n#25 Ã¢â‚¬Å“I NEED TO BE IN LOVEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Carpenters\n#24 Ã¢â‚¬Å“LAST CHILDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aerosmith\n#23 Ã¢â‚¬Å“THIS MASQUERADEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ George Benson\n#22 Ã¢â‚¬Å“YOUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢LL NEVER FIND ANOTHER LOVE LIKE MINEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lou Rawls\n#21 Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢M EASYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Keith Carradine\n#20 Ã¢â‚¬Å“MORE, MORE, MORE (PART 1)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Andrea True Connection\n#18 Ã¢â‚¬Å“TURN THE BEAT AROUNDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vicki Sue Robinson\n#17 Ã¢â‚¬Å“YOUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE MY BEST FRIENDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Queen\n#16 Ã¢â‚¬Å“TEAR THE ROOF OFF THE SUCKERÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Parliament\n#15 Ã¢â‚¬Å“YOU SHOULD BE DANCINGÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Bee Gees\n#14 Ã¢â‚¬Å“SHOP AROUNDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Captain &amp; Tennille\n#13 Ã¢â‚¬Å“IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Diamond\n#12 Ã¢â‚¬Å“THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWNÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Thin Lizzy\n#11 Ã¢â‚¬Å“TAKE THE MONEY AND RUNÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Steve Miller Band\n#10 Ã¢â‚¬Å“LET HER INÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Travolta\n#9 Ã¢â‚¬Å“ROCK AND ROLL MUSICÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Beach Boys\n#8 Ã¢â‚¬Å“DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T GO BREAKING MY HEARTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Elton John &amp; Kiki Dee\n#7 Ã¢â‚¬Å“GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Beatles\n#6 Ã¢â‚¬Å“GET CLOSERÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Seals &amp; Crofts\n#5 Ã¢â‚¬Å“LOVE IS ALIVEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gary Wright\n#4 Ã¢â‚¬Å“MOONLIGHT FEELS RIGHTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Starbuck\n#3 Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢LL BE GOOD TO YOUÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Brothers Johnson\n#2 Ã¢â‚¬Å“AFTERNOON DELIGHTÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Starland Vocal Band\n#1 Ã¢â‚¬Å“KISS AND SAY GOODBYEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Manhatta\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8103ca042032fcd0eb8728a2534f58686aed3b47","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1976_July_24th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8103ca042032fcd0eb8728a2534f58686aed3b47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,3,202,4,32,50,252,208,235,135,40,162,83,79,88,104,106,237,59,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
