It was developed by the Valve Software Corporation \nand was released on November 16, 2004, following a protracted five year \ndevelopment cycle during which the game's source code was leaked to the Internet. \nThe game garnered near unanimous positive reviews and received critical acclaim, \nwinning over 35 Game of the Year awards for 2004. Originally available only for \nWindows-based personal computers, the game has since been ported onto the Xbox \nconsole, and is also due to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2007.\n\nTaking place in and around the fictional City 17, Half-Life 2 follows the \nscientist Gordon Freeman. Dr. Freeman is thrust into a dystopian environment \nin which the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident has come to bear fully upon \nhuman society. Freeman is forced to fight against increasingly unfavorable odds \nin order to survive. In his struggle, he is joined by various allies, including \nfellow Black Mesa colleagues, oppressed citizens of City 17, and the Vortigaunts.\n\nThe game uses the Source game engine, which includes a heavily modified version \nof the Havok physics engine. Half-Life 2 has been critically acclaimed for advances in computer animation, sound, narration, computer graphics, artificial intelligence(AI) and physics. When sales figures were last announced, over four million copies of Half-Life 2 had been sold. Exact numbers for digital delivery service Steam and retail have not been revealed, but in general, the former accounts for 25% of Valve's business and is significantly more profitable per unit. Overall, the Half-Life franchise, including Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat, has seen over 15 million sales.\n\nThe Synergy mod used in this release grew from the merger of the Dev Co-op and DC \nCo-op 2 mod projects. In 2005, there were only three people working on Dev Coop \nwithout any real plans to release a public version. DC Coop 2 had around six active contributors and a Half-Life (1) mod called DC Coop. Since the first public release of Synergy (Beta 1.0) in September 2005, the team has continued to work on improvements, updates and features. \n\nCurrently this release allows for allows up to four player to go through the entire main PC campaign on various difficulty settings through an internet or LAN configuration, without needing to purchase Half-Life 2 or Half-Life:  Deathmatch. Furthermore, this game allows for the simultaneous use of the Half-Life 2, Half-Life: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2 - Co-op games. This release, like all steam cracks, only allows the user to play on cracked servers (Note: Any server hosted with this release will be automatically cracked). The purpose of this release is to resolve the AI, Node Graph, Elevator, and Sleeper errors present within previous releases.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your \ncomputer through the trial of this game.

Extract the &quot;Half-Life 2 - Co-op.rar&quot; file to a directory of your choice \nand then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default &quot;Half-Life 2 -  \nCo-op&quot;  directory. \n(2.) Run the &quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - PATCH.EXE&quot; and when prompted press any key.\n\nNOTE: If the system is running Windows Vista and is utilizing a NTFS partition\nyou can delete the .HALF-LIFE 2SYNGERGYMAPS directory with no loss of \nfunctionality while making available over one gigabyte of space. This is\npossible as the Federation binaries automatically create a symbolic link.\n\nNote: This release is portable and therefore the binaries/executables within \nmake no changes to the game/system files which are already updated, modded, \nand cracked.\n\n(3.) Double-click on the binary/executable whose name corresponds with the \ndesired game.\n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - CAMPAIGN&quot;             - Half-Life 2 Single player Gameplay\n&quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - CO-OP CLIENT&quot;         - Multiplayer Half-Life 2 Co-op\n&quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - CO-OP SERVER&quot;         - Multiplayer Half-Life 2 Co-op Server\n&quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - DEATHMATCH&quot;\t     - Multiplayer Half-Life : Deathmatch\n\nNotes (Co-op):\n\nTo play the campaign the user can either can create a custom server \n(Internet or Lan) using the &quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - CO-OP CLIENT&quot; binary or\nrun the &quot;HALF-LIFE 2 - CO-OP SERVER&quot; binary which will automatically create a \nfour player game on the starting campaign map using a LAN configuration (by default). \n\nTo change to a different level the users must either traverse through the campaign, \nor the server host must open a console window, and run the \n&quot;change_level [insert name of desired level] command&quot;.\n\nNotes:\n\nExtra content, including game convers, is located in the &quot;.EXTRAS&quot; directory.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and ROMS in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like \nthis one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project \nQuake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large amounts \nof lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, this mod \nwill be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is \nno release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFarCry Co-op - Assault/Campaign Co-op   |Quake II Ultimate Co-op - COOP or DIE\t\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete \nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete \nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete \nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete \nURL   -\thttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n3791203\t \t\t\t\t|3792230/Quake_II_Ultimate_COOP_or_DIE_\n\nDiablo - Ultimate UPD*\t \t        |Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\n4260899\t\t\t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator                |Vampire Masquerade:UltimateBloodlines   \n                                        |\t\t\t       \t\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)\t|4236344\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHalf-Life 2 Co-op - Synergy UPD*        |\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|\nURL   - Pending\t\t\t\t|\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Known Problems\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.) Mesa Ease Elevator - In Black Mesa East there is an elevator. The doctor\nwho must proceed with you for the elevator to move sometimes gets stuck. This\ngraphing bug can be resolved, merely by the server host changing the level.\nThe closes subsequent level is &quot;d1_eli_02&quot;. This issue is considered resolved\nand no further effort is being expended on it.\n\n(2.) Subtitles - The subtitles are slightly off during Co-op gameplay, either \noccurring too early or too late. This problem is unique to the game modifications \nused and therefore cannot be fixed. This issue is considered resolved and no \nfurther effort is being expended on it.\n\n(3.) False Positive - The users anti-virus client may detect this programs as a \nVirus or Trojan. This false positive is caused by the binary wrapped scripts   \n(UPX) which are utilized as launchers for the games. As these files create hidden \nfunctionality they appear as threatening to the overzealous virus scanner eSafe. \nDetailed scans have/will indicate that this release neither accesses key system \nfiles or the internet. There is no way for these files to harm your computer.\n\n(4.) Bugger - In spite of the patch one in every thousand users (generally individuals with old PCs) will notice the AI glitch, in which NPCs will not move along their intended maps. To resolve this glitch type the following commands into the console:\n                   ai_norebuildgraph &quot;0&quot;\n                   ai_disable &quot;0&quot;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t    Scene Requests/Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nwheybags - The Federation is always looking for talented new members.
