One such was the Italian-made Europa '51. Playing a character far older than herself, Bergman portrays a society woman whose life is in ruins after her son's suicide. Attempting to give her life some purpose, she takes the advice of a leftist friend, and begins working with the ill and destitute of Rome. Her insensitive husband Alexander Knox finds Bergman's charitable activities distasteful; when the opportunity presents itself, he has her committed to a mental institution. By the time Europa '51 was released in the US in 1954, its title -- and much of its political ideology -- had been outdated. The film was pared from 118 to 110 minutes for US consumption, and retitled The Greatest Love. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043511/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043511/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nRoberto Rossellini\n\n\n        Ingrid Bergman\t ... \tIrene Girard\n\tAlexander Knox\t... \tGeorge Girard\n\tEttore Giannini\t... \tAndrea Casatti\n\tTeresa Pellati\t... \tInes\n\tGiulietta Masina\t... \tPasserotto\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4fce0c736bce03ce84a6d0a700c6f73bc9a92ab","amp;dn":"Europa+%5C%2751+%281952%29+Ingrid+Bergman+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4fce0c736bce03ce84a6d0a700c6f73bc9a92ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,252,224,199,54,188,224,60,232,74,109,10,112,12,111,115,188,154,146,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
