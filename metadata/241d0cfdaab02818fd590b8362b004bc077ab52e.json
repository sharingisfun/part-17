Millions of dollars' worth of abalone lay there, just below the surface ripe for the picking, but can the divers make it out alive?\n\nThe Southern Ocean, off the tip of South Australia is home to more sharks per square kilometre than almost anywhere else in the world. \n\nThe risk of death by shark attack is very real here, many divers personally know the heart ache felt from losing loved ones. \n\nBut that doesn't stop this group of fearless men who, every season, battle against their nerves plunging to the depths and scouring the ocean floor for the much-prized green and black abalone.\n\nIn this never-before-seen series, we follow several fiercely competitive crews. Each sets out into the hostile waters to make enough money to support their families for the coming year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241d0cfdaab02818fd590b8362b004bc077ab52e","amp;dn":"Abalone+Wars+S01E01+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241d0cfdaab02818fd590b8362b004bc077ab52e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,29,12,253,170,176,40,24,253,89,11,131,98,176,4,188,7,122,181,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
