The death of his wife and newborn son shook him to his foundations, and he's been drifting ever since. Bryn Morgan has returned home from prison to the only family he has - an abusive father who abandoned him to the law when Bryn was unjustly accused of rape. Still poor, lost, and shunned, Bryn searches for work, any work that will allow him to survive.\n\nReluctantly moved by Bryn's plight, Ian hires the young man to work on his farm, despite Bryn's prickly, defensive nature. Soon Ian fears his growing feelings of grace and compassion might be something else, something more... heated. Whatever the cause, he knows they are impossible to pursue, because Heaven only knows what would happen if a man of God began to have forbidden feelings for his hired man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac09a7263d542843db12c0dcf930f9dfce6afb1a","amp;dn":"The+Hired+Man+by+Jan+Irving","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac09a7263d542843db12c0dcf930f9dfce6afb1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,9,167,38,61,84,40,67,219,18,192,220,249,48,249,223,206,106,251,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
