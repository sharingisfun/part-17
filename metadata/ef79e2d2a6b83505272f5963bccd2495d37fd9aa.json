Dan Rothwell\nPublished: 2012\nPublisher: Cengage\nISBN: 9781111346850 \nFormat: Retail PDF\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe market leader for the small group communication course, Rothwell's IN MIXED COMPANY offers students a combination of theory and application, enabling them to apply small group communication concepts not only in class but in their own lives. The text follows the central unifying theme of cooperation, and the communication competence model continues to guide discussions of key small group concepts and processes. The inclusion of systems theory remains a key theoretical component of the text, and the unique focus on power in groups continues to be addressed throughout the text. To encourage critical thinking, the eighth edition has captions to accompany photos and illustrations, and it also offers interactive quizzes related to the visuals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef79e2d2a6b83505272f5963bccd2495d37fd9aa","amp;dn":"In+Mixed+Company%2C+8E-+Rothwell+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef79e2d2a6b83505272f5963bccd2495d37fd9aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,121,226,210,166,184,53,5,39,47,89,99,188,205,36,149,211,127,217,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
