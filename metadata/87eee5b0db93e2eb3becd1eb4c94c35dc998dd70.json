The male          \n protagonist Viren, is a humble and ambitious   \n rickshaw driver working for Miny's father.     \n Bhatti, insecure about Viren's success,        \n sells of all the rickshaws where Viren had     \n carefully stashed his life savings. In an      \n attempt to recover his money from Bhatti,      \n Viren storms into Miny's engagement with fury. \n This gives Miny the perfect opportunity to     \n escape her marriage and so she stages a kidnap.\n However, the kidnap goes all wrong and she and \n Viren land up in Viren's family mansion.       \n Eventually, Miny's father arrives with the     \n ransom that she had asked for and takes her    \n back home. Back in Punjab, while she is being  \n married off to Sunny...                        \n                                                \n                                                \n  IMDB Link :                                   \n                                                \n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2130242/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2130242/&lt;/a&gt;       \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/2/im0s4dimqy7dq5/4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/2/im0s4dimqy7dq5/4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/4/vozo6mo86yzdv4/5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/4/vozo6mo86yzdv4/5.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/5/2codxvkuuzsdey/6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/5/2codxvkuuzsdey/6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/7/pdiohfmqcocsqp/7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://server1.upload-novalayer.com/files/7/pdiohfmqcocsqp/7.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87eee5b0db93e2eb3becd1eb4c94c35dc998dd70","amp;dn":"Tere+Naal+Love+Ho+Gaya+-+DVDScr+-+XviD+-+1CDRip+-+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87eee5b0db93e2eb3becd1eb4c94c35dc998dd70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,238,229,176,219,147,226,235,59,236,209,235,76,148,195,93,201,152,221,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
