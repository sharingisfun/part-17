But holing himself up in a crumbling palazzo in Venice to concentrate on his next novel hasn't got rid of the itch in his fingers. And to make matters worse, a striking Italian beauty has just broken into his apartment and made off with his most prized possession, leaving a puzzling calling card in its place.\nIt looks as though kicking the habit of a lifetime will be much more of a challenge than Charlie thought. Sneaking out into Venice's maze of murky canals, Charlie's attempts to tame a cat burglar embroil him in a plot that is far bigger and more explosive than he could ever have imagined.\n\nUnabridged (ca. 8 hours 43 minutes)\nRead by Simon Vance\nMP3/128 bit\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:debaabf4f11ad75e92e71b10bc3d6fd90e3792a9","amp;dn":"Chris+Ewan+-+The+Good+Thief%27s+Guide+to+Venice+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"debaabf4f11ad75e92e71b10bc3d6fd90e3792a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,186,171,244,241,26,215,94,146,231,27,16,188,61,111,217,14,55,146,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
