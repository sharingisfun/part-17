Michael J. TottenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s version of events in one of the most volatile countries in the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most volatile region is one part war correspondence, one part memoir, and one part road movie.\n\nHe sets up camp in a tent city built in downtown Beirut by anti-Syrian dissidents, is bullied and menaced by HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposedly friendly Ã¢â‚¬Å“media relationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ department, crouches under fire on the Lebanese-Israeli border during the six-week war in 2006, witnesses an Israeli ground invasion from behind a line of Merkava tanks, sneaks into HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s postwar rubblescape without authorization, and is attacked in Beirut by militiamen who enforce obedience to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“resistanceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at the point of a gun.\n\nFrom the Cedar Revolution that ousted the occupying Syrian military regime in 2005 to the devastating war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 to HezbollahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slow-motion but violent assault on LebanonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elected government and capital, TottenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account is both personal and comprehensive. He simplifies the bewildering complexity of the Middle East; gains access to major regional players as well as to the man on the street; and personally witnesses most of the events he describes. The Road to Fatima Gate should be indispensable reading for anyone interested in the Middle East, IranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expansionist foreign policy, the Arab-Israeli conflict, asymmetric warfare, and terrorism in the aftermath of September 11.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nMichael J.
