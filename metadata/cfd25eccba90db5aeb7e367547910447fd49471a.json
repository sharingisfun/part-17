Veteran producer Steve Brown (The Cult, the Pogues, Manic Street Preachers) takes the helm and the results are never less than satisfying. The Godfathers deliver muscular and meaty rock &amp; roll with the energy of the Ramones and the Stooges and a nod toward &amp;#039;60s melodicism. The title track kicks things off with a standard-issue condition of the world lyric but over a propulsive guitar-driven sonic bed. Lead singer Peter Coyne is a powerhouse vocalist and the chorus is snappy and infectious. The rest of the album, which gets stronger as it progresses, ranges from the sweet, unabashed guitar pop of &quot;Believe in Yourself&quot; and &quot;Drag Me Down Again&quot; to the metallic stomp of the equally hooky &quot;Something Good About You&quot; and &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Try Harder.&quot; \nUnreal World is a thunderous slab of rock played with passion and sincerity.\n\n\n\n01.
