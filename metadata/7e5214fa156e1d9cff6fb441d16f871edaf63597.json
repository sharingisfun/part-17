In the early twentieth century, Rondon, a military engineer, led what became known as the Rondon Commission in a massive undertaking: the building of telegraph lines and roads connecting BrazilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vast interior with its coast. Todd A. Diacon describes how, in stringing together a nation with telegraph wire, Rondon attempted to create a unified community of Ã¢â‚¬Å“BraziliansÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from a population whose loyalties and identities were much more local and regional in scope. He reveals the work of the Rondon Commission as a crucial exemplar of the issues and intricacies involved in the expansion of central state authority in Brazil and in the construction of a particular kind of Brazilian nation.\nUsing an impressive array of archival and documentary sources, Diacon chronicles the Rondon CommissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arduous construction of telegraph lines across more than eight hundred miles of the Amazon Basin; its exploration, surveying, and mapping of vast areas of northwest Brazil; and its implementation of policies governing relations between the Brazilian state and indigenous groups. He considers the importance of Positivist philosophy to RondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thought, and he highlights the Rondon CommissionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s significant public relations work on behalf of nation-building efforts. He reflects on the discussionsÃ¢â‚¬â€both contemporaneous and historiographicalÃ¢â‚¬â€that have made Rondon such a fundamental and controversial figure in Brazilian cultural history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5214fa156e1d9cff6fb441d16f871edaf63597","amp;dn":"Stringing+Together+a+Nation+%28Latin+History%29+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5214fa156e1d9cff6fb441d16f871edaf63597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,82,20,250,21,110,29,156,255,111,180,65,209,111,135,30,218,246,53,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
