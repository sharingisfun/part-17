How do I fix that?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t give you a lecture on flash ratios, or start a discussion on flash synchronization and rear curtain sync. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d just say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLower your shutter speed to 1/60 of a second. That should do itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Well, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what this book is all about: you and I out shooting where I answer questions, give you advice, and share the secrets IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned just like I would with a friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without all the technical explanations and techie photo speak.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nEach page covers a single concept on how to make your photography better. Every time you turn the page, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn another pro setting, tool, or trick to transform your work from snapshots into gallery prints.
