The project was released as the work of &quot;Brian May + Friends&quot;, consisting of May, guitarist Eddie Van Halen, drummer Alan Gratzer (of REO Speedwagon), Phil Chen (session bassist who played with Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart), and Fred Mandel (session keyboard player who also played as additional keyboard player on Hot Space World Tour and The Works). Roger Taylor, Queen's drummer, provided backing vocals for the title song. It was not meant for the tapes to be released and they had minimal mixing before release.\n\nRecorded on 21 and 22 April 1983 at the Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles, California, it was released in October of the same year as a Mini-LP, a &quot;challenge to the established principle that a piece of rock music must fit into either a 2x4 minute single, or a 2x20 minute LP format&quot;. The LP consisted of three songs: &quot;Star Fleet&quot;, &quot;Let Me Out&quot;, and &quot;Blues Breaker&quot;.\n\n1. &quot;Star Fleet&quot; is the theme tune for a superb TV sci-fi series broadcast in England for kids of all ages; Japanese visuals and British soundtrack including music by Paul Bliss. The heroes pilot space vehicles which can assemble into a giant robot for land battles. The aliens fly fantastic insect-like craft which spawn smaller fighting machines; all intent on possession of the secret of F Zero One. Having been introduced to all this by my small boy, I became equally obsessed by it, and formed the idea of making a hard rock version of the title theme.\n   \n\n2. &quot;Let Me Out&quot; was an old Brian May song which until that point had not been committed to record. During the song Eddie Van Halen &quot;tortures his top string to its audible death&quot; (according to May's liner notes) and plays the rest of the song on the remaining five.\n\n3. &quot;Blues Breaker&quot; was dedicated to Eric Clapton, of whom both Van Halen and May were huge fans. This song, as well as &quot;Let Me Out&quot; were more spontaneous than &quot;Star Fleet&quot;, showing both guitarists enjoying a jamming session, with Brian showing off his signature sound and Van Halen using his tapping technique to great effect (although the best example of this is at the beginning of &quot;Star Fleet&quot;).\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Brian May Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, vocals, production\n    Eddie Van Halen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, backing vocals\n    Alan Gratzer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Phil Chen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Fred Mandel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n    Roger Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ backing vocals on &quot;Star Fleet&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feec83411a521556ccc086c3ee844d32720ba66d","amp;dn":"Brian+May+and+Friends+-+Star+Fleet+Project+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feec83411a521556ccc086c3ee844d32720ba66d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,236,131,65,26,82,21,86,204,192,134,195,238,132,77,50,114,11,166,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
