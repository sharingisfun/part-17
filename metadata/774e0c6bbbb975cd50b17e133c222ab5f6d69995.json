Fifteen-year-old Mosey Slocumb-spirited, sassy, and on the cusp of womanhood-is shaken when a small grave is unearthed in the backyard, and determined to figure out why it's there. Liza, her stroke-ravaged mother, is haunted by choices she made as a teenager. But it is Jenny, Mosey's strong and big-hearted grandmother, whose maternal love braids together the strands of the women's shared past--and who will stop at nothing to defend their future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:774e0c6bbbb975cd50b17e133c222ab5f6d69995","amp;dn":"A+Grown-Up+Kind+of+Pretty+-+Joshilyn+Jackson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"774e0c6bbbb975cd50b17e133c222ab5f6d69995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,78,12,107,187,185,117,205,80,177,126,19,60,34,42,181,246,214,153,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
