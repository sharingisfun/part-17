Regarded as a classic, it is a fierce, raw, emotionally painful yet beautiful album. It contains some of the most personal and cathartic songs John ever wrote including Mother, Love, Working Class Hero , Isolation and God.\nDrawing from his painful and difficult early life, the songs address the basic issues of death, isolation, anger, religion, class, fear and love. Most of them were written while John and Yoko were undergoing primal therapy with Dr Arthur Janov at his centre in California to deal with the root causes of their pain and neuroses. \n\nScreenshot:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s24.postimg.org/rg4jtu6at/documentary_su_BBC_Classic_Albums_John_Lennon_Pl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s24.postimg.org/rg4jtu6at/documentary_su_BBC_Classic_Albums_John_Lennon_Pl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b29b1d622a26e1803ddb40d02a701cb856b9d872","amp;dn":"BBC+Classic+Albums+-+John+Lennon+Plastic+Ono+Band+%282010%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b29b1d622a26e1803ddb40d02a701cb856b9d872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,155,29,98,42,38,225,128,61,219,64,208,42,112,28,184,86,185,216,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
