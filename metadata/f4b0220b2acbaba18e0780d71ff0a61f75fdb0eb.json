They are in EPUB and AZW3 format.  This folder was pulled straight out of Calibre library so has metadata and cover images files.  All books range from good to retail quality.  I have noticed that Wrath James White books are extremely hard to find online and spent a fair bit of time gathering these from UseNet.  All books with multiple authors are just listed as Wrath James White in their metadata so that Calibre would put them all into the same folder for me.  Cover images state who other authors are if there are multiple authors so you can always add those authors in Calibre.  I am still missing a few Wrath James White books so if anyone has or knows where to find more please comment below.  \n\nMy upload speeds are not the best so please remain patient and seed for as long as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4b0220b2acbaba18e0780d71ff0a61f75fdb0eb","amp;dn":"Wrath+James+White+Collection+%28EPUB+%2B+AZW3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4b0220b2acbaba18e0780d71ff0a61f75fdb0eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,176,34,11,42,203,171,161,142,7,128,215,31,240,166,31,117,253,176,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
