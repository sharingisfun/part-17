In this timeless photographic treasury, the authors shine light on three charming characteristics that unify all cottages: a connection to nature, an intimately scaled design, and the use of locally made materials. They explore 24 superb American examples of all types-permanent homes and weekend getaways in rural, suburban, and urban locations, new cottages and remodels-discussing site planning, vernacular building materials, roof pitches, window sizes, interior design, and garden styles. Emphasizing current and future trends, &quot;Cottage&quot; is a storybook fantasy come alive.\n\nCottage - America's Favorite Home Inside and Out\nBook Language: English\nPages: 202\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 57 MB\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/ZpeVTNm.jpg[/IMG]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZpeVTNm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZpeVTNm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d14a5671c9b58b2c4bd2f6a092311bb8ea10717f","amp;dn":"Cottage+-+America%27s+Favorite+Home+Inside+and+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d14a5671c9b58b2c4bd2f6a092311bb8ea10717f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,74,86,113,201,181,139,44,75,210,246,160,146,49,27,184,234,16,113,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
