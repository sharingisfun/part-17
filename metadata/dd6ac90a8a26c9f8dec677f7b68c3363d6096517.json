Dress, surrounding the body, is determined by the shape it envelops. But the body is also defined by fashion in a manner that mingles the determinate form of physiology with the variable values and needs of culture. Recently, anthropology of the body has been subject matter for visual artists and theoreticians alike. Their work has led us to realize both the bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s malleability to social shaping and cultureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dependence on the body as indicative of an individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s primary cultural condition. Late twentieth-century culture has inflicted body denial upon some individuals, who resort to anorexia and bulimia to consummate control even when that deprivation is inimical to health.\n\n&quot;It has been a great privilege to work with Ruben Toledo. His portfolio of illustrations has surpassed our expectations. Working directly with garments in the exhibition, he has rendered them with historical truth and has also given them a vivacious presence.&quot; - Richard Martin and Harold Koda.\n\nPublished in conjunction with an exhibition held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, March 29 - Aug. 21, 1994.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd6ac90a8a26c9f8dec677f7b68c3363d6096517","amp;dn":"Waist+Not+-+The+Migration+of+the+Waist+1800-1960+%28Art+History+Eb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd6ac90a8a26c9f8dec677f7b68c3363d6096517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,106,201,10,138,38,201,248,222,198,119,247,182,140,51,99,214,9,101,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
