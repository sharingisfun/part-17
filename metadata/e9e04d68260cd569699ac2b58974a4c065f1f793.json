While most         \n    companies have anti-virus software, firewalls, email         \n        and web content security to protect against external      \n    threats, few realize how easy it is for an employee to   \n      simply walk in and copy large amounts of sensitive        \n      data onto an iPod or USB stick. There is also an          \n    increased risk of malicious and other illegal software     \n    introduction to your network through these devices. Of   \n   course your administrator could lock down all ports,        \n    an ill-advised, difficult and unsustainable solution.        \n                                                                  \n    Prevent Data Theft and Virus Infection from within       \n      with Endpoint Security Software                           \n      Many businesses are unaware of, or choose to ignore,      \n    the threat presented by portable devices in their          \n    network environment until some event, ranging from       \n   unfortunate to catastrophic, happens. According to          \n    eMedia research, few small to medium sized businesses        \n        consider portable storage devices to be a major           \n    threat; with fewer than 20% having implemented           \n      software to mitigate the risk. The key to managing        \n      portable devices in your business environment is to       \n    give your administrators direct control over what          \n    devices are in use on your network. With GFI             \n   EndPointSecurity you not only gain control over what       \n    is in use but you also know what has been used and by        \n        who, and most importantly you gain in-depth knowledge     \n    of what data has been copied.                            \n                                                                \n      Control Portable Device Access to Your Network with       \n    GFI EndPointSecurity                                       \n    GFI EndPointSecurity allows administrators to actively   \n   manage user access and log the activity of:                 \n                                                                 \n        -Media players, including iPods, Creative Zen and         \n    others                                                   \n      -USB drives, CompactFlash, memory cards, CDs, floppies    \n      &amp; other portable storage devices                          \n    -PDAs, BlackBerry handhelds, mobile phones, smart          \n    phones and similar communication devices                 \n   -Network cards, laptops and other network connections.      \n                                                                 \n                                                                 \n                                                           \n                                                 \n                                       \n                                              \n  I n s t a l l  I n f o                      \n                                       \n                                                              \n      Unzip and unrar release, install it.
