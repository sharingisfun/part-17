Each episode uncovers the sophisticated methods and radical techniques used by criminals who are willing to take drastic measures in order to turn a profit. Discovery Channel's new series Extreme Smuggling, shot partly from the point of view of smugglers themselves, reveals the often at times bizarre and disturbing ways that criminals try to feed the United States' insatiable demand for drugs, exotic animals and guns.\n\n\n1)  Drugs Part 1 \nThe rising demand in the United States for illicit drugs has created a fearless group of smugglers who are driven by greed to get their drugs to market by land, sea or air. This episode reveals the mind-boggling smuggling schemes employed by drug dealers, who will go as far as building real submarines and smuggling drugs inside bars of soap in order to push their products. Interviews with field agents directly involved in the cases will provide the inside stories of these risky drug busts, while footage shot by a producer brings viewers an unprecedented glimpse at the lives, inner workings and even homes of the smugglers themselves.\n\n2)  Drugs Part 2 \nIn this episode, learn how cartels utilize inventive trafficking tricks to get their drugs into the U.S. and employ extreme techniques to transport the mountains of money they make. Exclusive video footage takes viewers on high-speed pursuits of drug runners at sea and into a cartel's sophisticated tunnel network. Witness helicopter drug drops near the Canadian border and get inside access to a Peruvian cocaine smuggling ring. Compelling interviews with law enforcement and undercover video provides an inside look at what it takes to catch these criminals.\n\n3)  Wildlife \nIn this episode, enter the cruel and clandestine world of illegal wildlife trafficking, where millions of people pay big bucks for rare and exotic animals. Six out of every ten households in the United States owns a pet, but there is a dark side to the exotic pet trade: endangerment and extinction of species, irresponsible ownership and the spread of animal-borne diseases. The trafficking and smuggling of exotic and endangered wildlife is a booming black market business estimated to reel in an excess of ten billion dollars annually. Traffickers go to extremes from carrying live animals under their clothes to concealing millions of dollar's worth of ivory in hidden panels inside shipping containers. Watch undercover surveillance of the largest seizure of animals in American history, a restaurant raid in Cambodia and footage of shocking airport confiscations.\n\n4)  Weapons \nPulling back the curtain of the illegal gun trade, this episode gives an insider look at how criminals access and distribute weapons on the black market through corrupt gun dealers, straw buys and lack of regulation at gun shows. Watch actual surveillance footage of illegal gun deals going down with interviews from the agents of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Explosives who put their lives on the line to stop violent crimes and get illegal guns off America's streets.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/4852/p2ym.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/4852/p2ym.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3294/csn2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3294/csn2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/8018/f02v.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/8018/f02v.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/6989/hca6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/6989/hca6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/8199/hyy8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/8199/hyy8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img821.imageshack.us/img821/7646/ngxk.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img821.imageshack.us/img821/7646/ngxk.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/186/vrsa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/186/vrsa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9382/hnp1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img404.imageshack.us/img404/9382/hnp1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7656/ffth.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/7656/ffth.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2f674648476f631c011f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2135 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 662 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/discovery-channels-extreme-smuggling-video-412414&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/discovery-channels-extreme-smuggling-video-412414&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bfcc47c9df9564ee0ba58fd7ab766fe8b67cfec","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+Extreme+Smuggling+2of4+Drugs+Part+2+PDTV+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bfcc47c9df9564ee0ba58fd7ab766fe8b67cfec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,252,196,124,157,249,86,78,224,186,88,253,122,183,102,254,139,103,207,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
