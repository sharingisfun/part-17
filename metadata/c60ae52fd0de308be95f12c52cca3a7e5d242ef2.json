Session guests: The Damned.\n\nMP3, 192Kbps\nDuration: 1 hour approx.\n\nN.B. The version of this I received had the track markers in odd places and the middle of the Pere Ubu track &quot;Final Solution&quot; missing, presumably because of a tape flip. This version is my attempt to put the trackmarkers in reasonably logical places, and to reinstate the full version of &quot;Final Solution&quot;.\n\nNo Peel links were harmed in the making of this reconstruction.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\nThe Damned - So Messed Up (Peel Session)\nThe Seeds - Pushing Too Hard\nIggy and the Stooges - Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell\nEddie and the Hotrods - Horseplay (Wearier of the Schmaltz)\nThe Damned - Neat Neat Neat (Peel Session)\nRichard Hell and the Voidoids - Blank Generation (E.P. version)\nTelevision - Little Johnny Jewel Pt. 1\nTuff Darts - Slash\nPere Ubu - Final Solution\nThe Damned - New Rose (Peel Session)\nSex Pistols - Anarchy in the U.K.\nThe Fast - Boys Will Be Boys\nNew York Dolls - Personality Crisis\nThe Saints - I'm Stranded\nThe Damned - Stab Your Back (Peel Session)\nShadows of Knight - Light Bulb Blues\nRamones - California Sun\nRamones - I Don't Want to Walk Around With You","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c60ae52fd0de308be95f12c52cca3a7e5d242ef2","amp;dn":"John+Peel+-+Punk+Rock+Special+-+10th.+December+1976+%28Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c60ae52fd0de308be95f12c52cca3a7e5d242ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,10,229,47,208,222,48,139,233,95,18,197,44,202,58,126,93,36,46,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
