The album features a mix of live and studio recordings and comes with a DVD featuring a documentary of the band. The songs featured on the album include a studio recording of &quot;Laura&quot;, which was previously only available on the live album Alive Behind the Green Door, followed by studio acoustic and live versions of songs from their previous studio albums. The live songs were recorded at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles. The artwork was done by Shepard Fairey. The documentary was directed, shot, and edited by Jim Dziura. Assistant editing was done by Joe &quot;Guisepi&quot; Spadafora. Although primarily a DVD release, it charted at #67 on the American Billboard Top 200 Chart. It has been certified Platinum by the RIAA.\n\n[img]http://image.bayimg.com/f931a7b9ce46c2bfe5f21ed26f7af418a02769fe.jpg[/img]\n\n[quote][b]By the one and only on June 18, 2007[/b]\nI am a big fan of this group, and Whiskey on a Sunday is definately something any fan of Flogging Molly should pick up. With a compilation of great songs from different albums and an extra DVD that shows several backstage footage as well as different performances over the years a lots of funny moments, this is one set you want to pick up!\n\nMusic of the CD includes:\n&quot;Laura&quot; - 4:15\n&quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; (acoustic) - 4:55\n&quot;The Wanderlust&quot; (acoustic) - 3:37\n&quot;Another Bag of Bricks&quot; (acoustic) - 4:05\n&quot;Tomorrow Comes a Day Too Soon&quot; (acoustic) - 3:39\n&quot;The Likes of You Again&quot; (live) - 4:08\n&quot;Swagger&quot; (live) - 2:14\n&quot;Black Friday Rule&quot; (live) - 11:57\n&quot;Within a Mile of Home&quot; (live) - 4:34\n&quot;What's Left of the Flag&quot; (live) - 4:13\n\nDVD extras include:\n\n&quot;Badger&quot;, a short piece on Flogging Molly's technician.\n\n&quot;Dave in the Studio&quot;, Dave King singing Light of a Fading Star in the studio.\n\n&quot;Gary&quot;, a short piece on Gary Schwindt, the band's manager, also the brother of Flogging Molly's drummer George Schwindt.\n\n&quot;Joe and Matt&quot;, a short movie of Matt Hensley and Joe Sib from SideOneDummy Records goofing off.\n\n&quot;Outtakes&quot;, including Dennis Casey's request that someone set his nipples on fire.\n\n&quot;Return to Molly Malone's&quot;, a piece on a concert which Flogging Molly performed on Saint Patrick's Day at Molly Malone's Pub in Los Angeles, where the band first played.\n\n&quot;Rebels of the Sacred Heart&quot;, music video with live footage shot at the Wiltern Theater.\n\n&quot;Selfish Man&quot;, music video with live footage shot at the Wiltern Theater.\n\nThis is definately recommended.
