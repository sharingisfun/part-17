Tracks like Tony &amp; Jackie Lamie's &quot;Wore to a Frazzle,&quot; Mack Banks' &quot;Be-Boppin' Daddy,&quot; the Hi-Tombs' &quot;Sweet Rockin' Mama,&quot; Warren Robbe's &quot;My Chicken Penn&quot; are rockabilly with one foot still doing a square dance, hillbilly artists giving this new music a shot with surprisingly wild results. The quality and approaches vary wildly from rocked-out strokes like Rudy Grayzell's &quot;Let's Get Wild&quot; and Jay Richards' &quot;Gosh Dog Baby&quot; to straight-up Elvis wannabes like Gene Terry's &quot;The Woman I Love&quot; and Carl Trantham's &quot;Where There's a Will (There's a Way).&quot; You'd be hard-pressed to find a cruder bopper than &quot;Boogie Woogie All Night&quot; by Bill Willis, just as you'd be equally hard-pressed to find a better Jerry Lee tribute than Groovy Joe Poovey's &quot;Ten Long Fingers.&quot; Bottom line, this is one '50s rockabilly collection that delivers the goods big time and would make an essential addition to anyone's rockabilly must-have list. No major hits, but much major music. ~ Cub Koda\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d050bcec13787057457c825fe583b3c7efdc60b0","amp;dn":"STARDAY+DIXIE+ROCKABILLY%2C+VOL.+1+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d050bcec13787057457c825fe583b3c7efdc60b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,80,188,236,19,120,112,87,69,124,130,95,229,131,179,199,239,220,96,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
