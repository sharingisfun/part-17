Even after years later,it still to this day holds the title of one of the best television mini-series of all time.\n\nUnder the usual definition of a \\&quot;series\\&quot;,ROOTS would not be included as a made for television movie-it was really an extended special. But in fact that it was the most-watched dramatic special in the history of television,and its considerable impact on its viewers was outstanding. The overall success of ROOTS was unprecedented. Approxiamately over 100 million viewers saw the concluding installment and it must be considered an event of considerable magnitude when nearly half of the entire population of the United States can be assembled in front of its television sets to watch a single dramatic presentation. No one,not even ABC,was prepared for anything this big. In fact,one of the reasons given for scheduling ROOTS on eight consecutive nights was that if it were a flop it would be over with quickly. But it wasn\\&amp;#039;t. It became a tidalwave of a hit. And America was watching.\n\n\nEp2 : &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3615846/Roots_Part_2_of_6__-_for_Black_History_Month_2007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3615846/Roots_Part_2_of_6__-_for_Black_History_Month_2007&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEp3 &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3617451/Roots_Part_3_of_6_-_for_Black_History_Month_2007&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3617451/Roots_Part_3_of_6_-_for_Black_History_Month_2007&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEp4 : http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3618871/Roots_Part_4_of_6_-_for_Black_History_Month_2007\n\nEp5 : http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3620555/Roots_Part_5_of_6_-_for_Black_History_Month_2007\n\nEp6 : http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3622020/Roots_Part_6_of_6_-_for_Black_History_Month_2007_amended\n\n\n\n\nThere are still seeds from last years sowing so I&amp;#039;ll top up where needed during February .\n\nPlease leave requests here so I only have to look in one place .
