Elizabeth McGovern plays a vulnurable and quite lovely pawn\nto Caine's aspirations and desires - in the plot overall.\n\nThis movie file was found on the net and is being brought to you with \nsubtitles added which we found at other sites where they are posted\nfor us all to get lucky now and then - although this time we struck out \nlooking for an English template srt to allow for easy subtitles creations \ninto other languages even perhaps possible instantly so.\n\n\nSubtitles for : Rusian, Romanian, Serbian included in UTF-8 SRT format\n\n720 X 416 Xvid video and 2150k bitrate, 384k AC3 5.1 surround sound audio\nwas included with the file we obtained and we bring it to you with this \naspect too, unchanged.\n\n1:27:53 movie lenght 24fps source\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9a2c6012ef194802abfababf3ef2c7f57530a62","amp;dn":"A+Shock+to+the+System+%281990%29+Michael+Caine+%28moviesbyrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9a2c6012ef194802abfababf3ef2c7f57530a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,162,198,1,46,241,148,128,42,191,171,171,243,239,44,127,87,83,10,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
