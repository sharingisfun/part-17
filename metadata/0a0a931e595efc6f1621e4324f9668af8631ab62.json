Hydra also goes beyond the 8-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies of iOS 8.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Video-HDR uses single-image tonemapping and device-specific sensor mode (iPhone 6) to create stunning videos. \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Lo-light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x and 4x scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album (iOS 8 feature), thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static &amp; distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a0a931e595efc6f1621e4324f9668af8631ab62","amp;dn":"Hydra+-+Amazing+Photography+v1.0.1+IOS.ipa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a0a931e595efc6f1621e4324f9668af8631ab62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,10,147,30,89,94,252,111,22,33,228,50,79,150,104,175,134,49,171,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
