This was his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sacred mission, and his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s before him, going back countless generations in an effort to free their people from enslavement. But when Siris somehow succeeds where all those from his bloodline previously have failed, he finds himself cast into a much larger world, filled with warriors and thieves, ancient feuds and shifting alliances, Deathless immortals and would-be kings. His quest for freedom will take him on an epic journey in search of the mythical figure known as the Worker of Secrets ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the one being in the world who can unravel the secrets of the Infinity Blade.\n\nBased on the bestselling video game from ChAIR Entertainment and Epic Games, this all-new adventure from acclaimed fantasy author Brandon Sanderson digs deeper into the fantastical world of Infinity Blade, a world of mystery and intrigue where magic and technology are indistinguishable, and even life and death are not what they seem.\n\nBrandon Sanderson has published six solo novels with Tor BooksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Elantris, the Mistborn trilogy, Warbreaker, and The Way of KingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as four books in the middle-grade Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians series from Scholastic.
