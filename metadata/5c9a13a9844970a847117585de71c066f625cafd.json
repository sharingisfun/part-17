James Q. Wilson redefined the public debate by offering a brilliant and provocative new argumentÃ¢â‚¬â€that criminal activity is largely rational and shaped by the rewards and penalties it offersÃ¢â‚¬â€and forever changed the way Americans think about crime. Now with a new foreword by the prominent scholar and best-selling author Charles Murray, this revised edition of Thinking About Crime introduces a new generation of readers to the theories and ideas that have been so influential in shaping the American justice system.\n\n320 pages\nPublisher: Basic Books; Revised Edition edition (May 14, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0465048838\nISBN-13: 978-0465048830","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c9a13a9844970a847117585de71c066f625cafd","amp;dn":"Thinking+About+Crime+%5BRevised+Ed%5D+%282013%29+by+James+Q.+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c9a13a9844970a847117585de71c066f625cafd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,154,19,169,132,73,112,168,71,17,117,133,222,113,192,102,246,37,202,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
