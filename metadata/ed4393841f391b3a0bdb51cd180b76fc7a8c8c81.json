And over the past decade we have experienced some extraordinary weather conditions, with 2012 no exception. It has led many people to wonder if our weather really is getting worse. The year started with storms and gale-force winds tearing across much of the UK, before our driest spring in a century left 35 million people in the UK suffering from drought. In Aberdeen in March, temperatures soared to 23 degrees Celsius. But within four weeks, everything had changed. April 15 marked the beginning of our wettest summer on record. Towns such as Hebden Bridge in Yorkshire were flooded not once, but twice, and by the end of August 4000 homes across Britain had been devastated by floods. But the strange events of 2012 are only part of the story. For the past decade, our weather has been so erratic that government scientists have begun to use words like 'unprecedented' and 'extraordinary'. This programme gets to the truth of our extraordinary decade of extreme weather. Blending dramatic archive footage, expert insight and cutting-edge graphics, the film investigates the most severe weather events to have struck Britain in recent memory and puts them into the wider context of climate change. Are the strange events of 2012 a one-off or an ominous sign of climate change in action? How does the changing global climate affect the British weather and what can we expect in the future? Is our weather getting worse?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img217.imageshack.us/img217/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/6638/isourweathergettingwors.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1951 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 47mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/is-our-weather-getting-worse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/is-our-weather-getting-worse&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4393841f391b3a0bdb51cd180b76fc7a8c8c81","amp;dn":"Ch4+Is+Our+Weather+Getting+Worse+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4393841f391b3a0bdb51cd180b76fc7a8c8c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,67,147,132,31,57,27,58,11,219,81,205,24,11,118,252,122,140,140,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
