Madsen attended the University of Mississippi where he joined the Navy ROTC and was later commissioned an ensign and underwent training at the Surface Warfare School. Between 1985 and 1989 Madsen held a series of jobs, first working for RCA as a government consultant on contracts for the National Security Agency (NSA) and later he worked for the Navy's Naval Data Automation Command as a civilian employee. After this Madsen briefly established his own consulting firm, then worked for the National Bureau of Standards, and later for the State Department. He currently edits and publishes the Wayne Madsen Report. \n[2nd half of hour 2]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.waynemadsenreport.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.waynemadsenreport.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[FWIW, Ted Anderson is on in hour 2 for about as much time as Wayne Madsen.]\n\n\n\n\nPrison Planet.tv editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson and author and GCN radio host Webster Tarpley also discuss the Yemen non-bombing incident.
