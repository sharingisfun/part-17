An unprecedented tool for spiritual and psychological exploration, acid takes effect after only a microscopic amount is ingested. Yet most people know very little about this influential molecule. \n\nExhaustively researched, this book cuts through the confusion and delivers the facts about chemical formulas, the causes of a bad trip, what factors influence a trip, acid's spiritual and creative effects, plant sources of LSD-like chemicals, the myth of the &quot;bad&quot; acid, the law and acid, and more. It also tells about the ergot fungus that underground chemists use to manufacture acid, along with how scientists cultivate ergot, process it to extract chemicals, and transform the chemicals into LSD.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.erowid.org/library/books/acid_trips.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.erowid.org/library/books/acid_trips.shtml&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92d84f2c3472c81a0533499bb3d0bedc04cfbcad","amp;dn":"Cam+Cloud+-+Acid+Trips+and+Chemistry+%28LSD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92d84f2c3472c81a0533499bb3d0bedc04cfbcad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,216,79,44,52,114,200,26,5,51,73,155,179,208,190,220,4,207,188,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
