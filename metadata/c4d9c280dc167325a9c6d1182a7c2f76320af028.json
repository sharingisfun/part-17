Vocalist Chris Norman, bassist Terry Utley, guitarist Alan Silson, and drummer Ron Kelly had played in the Elizabethans, but formed the band Kindness in 1970. The quartet recorded many singles during the late '60s and early '70s, but failed to show any chart activity. By 1973, Kelly had left the band and was replaced by Pete Spencer. In 1975, the band, signed to Rak Records, and billed as Smokey, hit number three in the U.K. with &quot;If You Think You Know How to Love Me.&quot; After another Top Ten hit, &quot;Don't Play Your Rock 'n' Roll to Me,&quot; Smokey became Smokie; during 1976, the group scored with three Top 20 hits, including the number five &quot;Living Next Door to Alice.&quot; \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.It's Your Life\n02.I Can't Stay Here Tonight\n03.Don't Play Your Rock'N'Roll To Me\n04.Changing All The Time\n05.Stranger\n06.What Can I Do\n07.Little Lucy\n08.Babe It's Up To You\n09.Needles And Pins\n10.London Is Burning\n11.Light Up My Life\n12.Wild Wild Angels\n13.Lay Back In The Arms Of Someone\n14.Oh Carol\n15.Pass It Around\n16.All Alone\n17.Daydreamin'\n18.For A Few Dollars More\n19.Petesey's Song\n20.Mexican Girl\n21.Stumblin' In (Feat.
