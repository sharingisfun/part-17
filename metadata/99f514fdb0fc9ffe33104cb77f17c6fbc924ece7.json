Every Picture Tells a Story achieved the same status at the same time, a feat achieved by only a handful of performers, notably The Beatles, John Lennon, George Harrison, Paul McCartney, Simon and Garfunkel, and BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.\n\nThe song was Stewart's first substantial hit as a solo performer and launched his solo career. It remains one of his best-known songs. A famous live performance of the song on Top of the Pops saw The Faces joined onstage by DJ John Peel, who pretended to play the mandolin. Stewart himself was amused by the song's success, saying, &quot;I still can't see how the single is such a big hit. It has no melody. Plenty of character and nice chords, but no melody\n\nThe song re-entered the UK charts in December 1976, but only reached number 31.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the song #130 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\n                            ***Maggie May.***\n\n\n                               Enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f514fdb0fc9ffe33104cb77f17c6fbc924ece7","amp;dn":"Rod+Stewart-Maggie+May%281971%29-Wushan.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f514fdb0fc9ffe33104cb77f17c6fbc924ece7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,245,20,253,176,252,159,254,51,16,76,183,127,23,198,251,201,36,236,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
