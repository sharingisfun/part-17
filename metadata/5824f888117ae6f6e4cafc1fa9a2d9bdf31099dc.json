I figured I would upload something small. :) I'm going to do a Staind discography next and then I will get to request. You can always request something in the comments but that does not mean I will do it.\n\nEnjoy this amazing EP! Aaron Lewis is a very talented man and if you enjoyed this album please support him and buy the EP. You can find it on Amazon for 3 bucks. It isn't like you have to sell an arm and a leg. \n\nDon't be greedy! Seed, Comment, and Rate\n\nTyMoD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5824f888117ae6f6e4cafc1fa9a2d9bdf31099dc","amp;dn":"Aaron+Lewis+-+Town+Line+%28iTunes%29+%2ATyMoD%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5824f888117ae6f6e4cafc1fa9a2d9bdf31099dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,36,248,136,17,122,230,246,228,202,252,31,169,162,217,189,243,16,153,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
