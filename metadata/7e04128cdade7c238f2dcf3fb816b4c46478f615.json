Rainbows and rainforests, oceans and humanity, Earth is the most colourful place we know of. But the colours we see are far more complex and fascinating than they appear. In this series, Dr Helen Czerski uncovers what colour is, how it works, and how it has written the story of our planet - from the colours that transformed a dull ball of rock into a vivid jewel to the colours that life has used to survive and thrive. But the story doesn't end there - there are also the colours that we can't see, the ones that lie beyond the rainbow. Each one has a fascinating story to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Colours Of Earth \r\nIn the first episode, Helen seeks out the colours that turned planet Earth multicoloured. To investigate the essence of sunlight Helen travels to California to visit the largest solar telescope in the world. She discovers how the most vivid blue is formed from sulfur atoms deep within the Earth's crust and why the presence of red ochre is a key sign of life. In gold, she discovers why this most precious of metals shouldn't even exist on the surface of the planet and in white, Helen travels to one of the hottest places on Earth to explore the role salt and water played in shaping planet Earth.\r\n\r\n2)  Colours of Life \r\nEarly Earth was a canvas for the vast new palette of the colours of life, with the diversity of human skin tones telling the story of how humanity spread and ultimately conquered the planet. Dr Helen Czerski explores the true masters of colour - which are often the smallest and most elusive - travelling to the mountains of Tennessee to witness the colourful mating display of fireflies, and revealing the marine creatures that can change the colour of their skin in order to hide from the world.\r\n\r\n3)  Beyond the Rainbow \r\nHelen Czerski ventures beyond the visible spectrum in the final (and best) episode in this vibrant little series, showing how electromagnetic radiation is so much broader than the narrow slice of reality we see with our eyes. Before delving into the details of UV, infrared and x-rays, Dr Czerski explores colour subjectivity by trying on a dress that recently divided the internet - to some it appeared blue and black, to others white and gold. It's a perfect fit. It's also a neat analogy of how people can have opposing views but both swear blind that their perspective is correct. The series ends with some amazing imaging techniques that show our bodies in a whole new light.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/04/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Colour-The-Spectrum-of-Science-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3027 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.31 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02vmwbt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e04128cdade7c238f2dcf3fb816b4c46478f615","amp;dn":"BBC+Colour+The+Spectrum+Of+Science+1of3+Colours+Of+Earth+720p+x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e04128cdade7c238f2dcf3fb816b4c46478f615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,4,18,140,218,222,124,35,143,45,207,63,184,22,180,196,100,120,246,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
