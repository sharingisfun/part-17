In the first part, there are 8 chapters describing new materials and analytic methods. These materials include chapters on gold nanoparticles and Sol-Gel metal oxides, nanocomposites with carbon nanotubes, methods of evaluation by depth sensing, and other methods. The second part contains 3 chapters featuring new materials with unique properties including optical non-linearities, new materials based on pulp fibers, and the properties of nano-filled polymers. The last part contains 5 chapters with applications of new materials for medical devices, anodes for lithium batteries, electroceramics, phase change materials and matrix active nanoparticles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96150bf5796743455cf10df366f39525beee8087","amp;dn":"Nanocomposites+and+Polymers+with+Analytical+Methods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96150bf5796743455cf10df366f39525beee8087","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,21,11,245,121,103,67,69,92,241,13,243,102,243,149,37,190,238,128,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
