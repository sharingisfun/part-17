This one is about one man's obsession with a woman... and it's incredibly strange. There's symbolism and metaphor, no doubt, but I'm not sure how well the translation was done (I think something was probably lost along the way). The possibly slightly sketchy dialogue just adds to the nervous tension. The end... the end is completely wtf surreal and makes reading the whole book worth it. \n\nThe real joy of this book, though, is the art, which is nothing short of brilliant. Richly detailed panels morph weirdly from one to another, repeatedly showing you both sides of one scene, looping through themselves only to end up looking over the shoulder of the scene you were just looping through. It's perfect for this story and it's very well done. It's easy to go fast after you've read thousands of comic books. Take some time with this one...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nDolores\n\nCasterman, 1991, 75 pages\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Dolores Anne Baltus, Benoit Peeters, Francois Schuiten","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5dbab6d0730319a2ae647ddddc7d36e6f46f369","amp;dn":"Dolores","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5dbab6d0730319a2ae647ddddc7d36e6f46f369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,219,171,109,7,48,49,154,42,230,71,221,221,199,211,110,111,70,243,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
