And no oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s had more access to the inner workings of the phenomenon than Kirkpatrick, a senior tech writer at Fortune magazine. Written with the full cooperation of founder Mark Zuckerberg, the book follows the company from its genesis in a Harvard dorm room through its successes over Friendster and MySpace, the expansion of the user base, and ZuckerbergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s refusal to sell. The author is at his best discussing the social implications of the site, from the changing notions of privacy to why and how people use FacebookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½increasingly itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s to come together around a common interest or cause (the eponymous Facebook Effect). Though significantly more informative, thoughtful, and credible than Ben MezrichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Accidental Billionaires, it may be hamstrung by its late entry; the furor over Facebook has more or less subsided, and potential readers are more likely to be using the site than to be reading about its origins.\n\n-------------------------------------\nVisit us for this, and loads more:\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n-------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49bf3d1b2afec869a08cc4cae256f896a078ca5b","amp;dn":"The+Facebook+Effect+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+David+Kirkpatrick","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49bf3d1b2afec869a08cc4cae256f896a078ca5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,191,61,27,42,254,200,105,160,140,196,202,226,86,248,150,160,120,202,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
