The Romans were mass-producers, capitalists and bureaucrats who during their 400-year stay in Britain built dozens of towns and miles of roads, leaving a fascinating and complex legacy that forms the basis of much of our technology today. Presented by Adam Hart-Davis, &quot;What The Romans Did For Us&quot; investigates the innovations that Romans brought to our shores and assesses their considerable impact on our lives. It features demonstrations and reconstructions of extraordinary Roman devices, and provides an alternative, dynamic history of the people that transformed Britain.\n\n1 Episode one: Life of Luxury\n2 Episode two: Invasion\n3 Episode three: Building Britain\n4 Episode four: Arteries of the Empire\n5 Episode five: Edge of Empire\n6 Episode six: Ahead of Their Time\n\nA short sample is included for evaluation.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01bf4a03160531f1bcdc77e31bc3cd9deb025206","amp;dn":"What+The+Romans+Did+For+Us+++%28BBC+2000+-+Complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01bf4a03160531f1bcdc77e31bc3cd9deb025206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,191,74,3,22,5,49,241,188,220,119,227,27,195,205,157,235,2,82,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
