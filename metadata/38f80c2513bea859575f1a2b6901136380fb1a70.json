Here they perform their debut, some blues standards and much of what would become Strange Days in a near-empty LA nightclub. There's a ghostly, eerie atmosphere as storming renditions of Soul Kitchen and The Crystal Ship are met with polite applause. Although Back Door Man hints at sexual deviance, Jim Morrison has not yet discovered the Dionysian power that made him such an explosive (if excessive) performer; he sounds focused, innocent and eager. The instrumental flights of Ray Manzarek, John Densmore and Robbie Krieger show the Doors were a mighty force even without him, although Morrison's poetry and ad-libs dwelling on death hint at what's to come. If he had known the Cult's Ian Astbury would be fronting the reunited Doors 31 years later, perhaps he would have stuck around.\nReview by The Guardian Newspapers Dave Simpson 19/12/2008\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Break On Through (To The Other Side)\n[02] Soul Kitchen\n[03] Money\n[04] The Chrystal Ship\n[05] Twentieth Century Fox\n[06] I'm A King Bee\n[07] Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)\n[08] Summer's Almost Gone\n[09] Light My Fire\n[10] Get Out Of My Life, Woman\n[11] Back Door Man\n[12] Who Do You Love\n[13] The End\n\nPlay Time - 01h:04m:59s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Unhappy Girl\n[02] Moonlight Drive\n[03] The Woman Is A Devil Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rock Me\n[04] People Are Strange\n[05] Close To You\n[06] My Eyes Have Seen You\n[07] Crawling King Snake\n[08] I Can See Your Face In My Mind\n[09] Summertime\n[10] When The MusicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Over\n[11] Gloria\n\nPlay Time - 00h:59m:05s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:04m:04s\nTotal File Size....................... 298mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
