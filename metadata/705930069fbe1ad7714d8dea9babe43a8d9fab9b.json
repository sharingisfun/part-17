Daniel Boone created a legend with one. Abraham Lincoln shot them on the White House lawn. And Teddy Roosevelt had his specially customized.\nIn this first-of-its-kind book, historian Alexander Rose delivers a colorful, engrossing biography of an American icon: the rifle. Drawing on the words of foot soldiers, inventors, and presidents, based on extensive new research, and spanning from the Revolution to the present day, American Rifle is a balanced, wonderfully entertaining history of the rifle and its place in American culture.\n\n\nEditorial Reviews\nAmazon.com Review\nAmazon Best of the Month, October 2008: Given the title, American Rifle is a book that many potential readers might dismiss without a thought. Don't do it: Alexander Rose's peculiar &quot;biography&quot; is not written for gun enthusiasts--though they'll certainly enjoy it--but for anyone interested American history from George Washington to the Wild West to Iraq. Drawing on original sources ranging from Samuel Colt to the soldiers who depend on the weapon the most, this book is an exhaustive history of the rifle's place in American culture, not only as an instrument of war, but also as a driver of technological innovation and advances in mass production that helped propel the United States into its role as both a military and economic superpower. Once you start, American Rifle will have to be pried from your cold, dead hands before you put it down. --Jon Foro\n--This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\n\n#Amazon http://www.amazon.com/American-Rifle-Biography-Alexander-Rose/dp/0553384384/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372388891&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=america+rifle+a+biography\n\n# Publisher \tDelta; Reprint edition (September 29, 2009)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ISBN-10 \t0553384384\n# ISBN-13 \t978-0553384383\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:705930069fbe1ad7714d8dea9babe43a8d9fab9b","amp;dn":"American+Rifle%3A+A+Biography++-+epub++%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"705930069fbe1ad7714d8dea9babe43a8d9fab9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,89,48,6,159,190,26,215,113,77,141,234,155,171,228,58,141,159,171,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
