Previously imprisoned for a crime he didn&amp;#039;t commit, Luciano (Ricardo Trepa) emerges into the real world in desperate need of a sense of direction. Luciano is haunted by the death of his sister Camila, though he does his best to stay distracted from family ghosts by going to work at the manor house of malcontent rich woman Alfreda (Leonor Silveira). Married to the much older Bahia (Duarte de Almeida), Alfreda has no children and spends much of her time discussing religious issues with eccentric Bible scholar Herschel (Michel Piccoli). When man-in-waiting Luciano fails to convince Alfreda that her fixation on the Virgin Mary is merely a delusion brought about by mental malaise, he subsequently hires local girl Filipe (Luis Miguel Cintra) to pose as the Madonna as part of an elaborate, but obscure, ruse.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Manoel de Oliveira - Espelho Magico.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.57 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 11mn\n      Bit rate : 1701 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.2 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 11mn\n      Bit rate : 1504 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.254\n      StreamSize : 1.39 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 11mn\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 180 MiB\n\nPortuguese audio, English and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5b312522e415cec420f97d4b2eec9509636cad","amp;dn":"Manoel+de+Oliveira+-+Espelho+Magico","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5b312522e415cec420f97d4b2eec9509636cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,91,49,37,34,228,21,206,196,32,249,125,75,46,236,149,9,99,108,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
