Love, Citizen Cope is a musical mixologist, fusing sluggish hip-hop beats with mellow piano melodies and new-school blues with easy-listening pop. On his debut album, Cope--nÃƒÂ©e Clarence Greenwood, former DJ for the rap group Basehead--sounds at times like both a younger, drawling Sting and a folksy Wyclef Jean as he sings over slow, loose, loungy instrumentals. Though his music is a patchwork of breezy styles, Cope's lyrics tackle some serious subjects. &quot;Contact&quot; confronts the hypocrisy of police profiling, while &quot;200,000 (in Counterfeit 50 Dollar Bills)&quot; details the work of a shifty middle-aged hustler. Cope tells stories about crazy women (&quot;Mistaken ID&quot;) and lost souls with short fuses (&quot;Appetite (for Lightin' Dynamite)&quot;), and even fantasizes about the musician's fight with the stay pure (&quot;Salvation&quot;), tucking a gritty street realism between the rosy rhythms dancing through these 13 songs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e24286502bbc029a95fe3b719fcc9248c3ac8a","amp;dn":"Citizen+Cope+-+Citizen+Cope+%5B2002%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e24286502bbc029a95fe3b719fcc9248c3ac8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,226,66,134,80,43,188,2,154,149,254,59,113,159,204,146,72,195,172,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
