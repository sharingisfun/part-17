SysML is a general purpose graphical modeling language used to specify, analyze, and design systems that may include hardware, software, and personnel. It allows engineers to describe how a system interacts with its environment, and how its parts must interact to achieve the desired system behavior and performance. The SysML model provides a shared view of the system, enabling a design team to surface issues early and prevent problems that would otherwise delay development and degrade design quality. Since SysML is based on UML, it also facilitates integration between systems and software development. SysML is now being adopted by companies across a broad range of industry, including Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, and IT System Developers.\n\nThis book provides a comprehensive and practical guide for modeling systems with SysML. It includes a full description of the language along with a quick reference guide, and shows how the language can be applied to specify, analyze, and design systems. It contains examples to help readers understand how SysML can be used in practice. The book also includes guidance on how an organization or project can transition to model based systems engineering using SysML, with considerations for processes, methods, tools, and training.\n\n*The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML\n*Authored by the foremost experts on the language\n*Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd0f295362318e5885ac9dc3775061272531c054","amp;dn":"A+Practical+Guide+to+SysML%3A+The+Systems+Modeling+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd0f295362318e5885ac9dc3775061272531c054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,15,41,83,98,49,142,88,133,172,157,195,119,80,97,39,37,49,192,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
