The trailer quickly leaked on to the Internet and by Monday night 2012.03.19 the trailer had over 100,000 YouTube views. Take down notices removed these copies starting Wednesday 2012.03.21.\n\nThis post shares 3 versions of the Blood and Chrome trailer, all of which use a lossless FLAC version of the O-Reznor-Ross Immigrant Song cover for the music:\n1) the original leaked trailer, a 1080p streaming web video\n2) a frame for frame replica of the original trailer using a blu-ray source\n3) a version that uses extra clips so a full length version of the Immigrant Song cover is used\n\nAll 3 versions of the audio are beat matched identically with the original so the scene changes are paced with the song.\n\nBattlestar.Galactica.Blood.and.Chrome.Trailer.Streaming.1080p.mkv\n1minute 35seconds 32,145,039bytes V:2500Kbps\n\nBattlestar.Galactica.Blood.and.Chrome.Trailer.Original.BluRay.1080p.mkv\n1minute 35seconds 38,140,847bytes V:3000Kbps \n\nBattlestar.Galactica.Blood.and.Chrome.Trailer.Extended.BluRay.1080p.mkv\n2minutes 30seconds 59,902,229bytes V:3000Kbs\n\nPlease check out other Battlestar Galactica posts plus Rifftrax, Star Trek Enterprise, DC Comics, documentaries and more at:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/&lt;/a&gt;  \nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\n\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5893e586ed5966ea8bb4142252b55ab1ccceb9","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+Blood+and+Chrome+Trailer+3+Mixes+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5893e586ed5966ea8bb4142252b55ab1ccceb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,88,147,229,134,237,89,102,234,139,180,20,34,82,181,90,177,204,206,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
