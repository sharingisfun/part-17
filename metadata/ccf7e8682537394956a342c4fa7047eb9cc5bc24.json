But in the last two decades, crime has gone down; homicide is down 5%; rape down 35%; robbery, 56%; and assault, 45%. Horrible things do happen, but they've always happened, and used to happen more often.\n\nBEST OF TIMES? Recently, President Obama said, &quot;The world is less violent than it has ever been.&quot; He was mocked for saying this, and yet this statement is entirely true. Things are better. The violence today doesn't compare to the 1940s and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ50s when millions were killed during World War II, the Korean War and in Communist China under Chairman Mao.\n\nTHE GUN MYTH: Politicians and the media constantly scream about gun crime. But violent crime rates are down while the number of Americans who own permits to carry guns has tripled.\n\nBUREAUCRATS OVERREACT: A 7-year-old boy in Maryland was suspended this year for molding a Pop-Tart into the shape of a gun. In New Jersey, another student was suspended for twirling a pencil...\n\nHOLLYWOOD HYPOCRITES: Actors like Matt Damon and Sylvester Stallone push gun control, but they keep making movies filled with gun use.\n\nMY TAKE: The world hasn't gotten meaner. Terrorism is a threat, but less of one than the hot and cold wars of my youth. The air and water are cleaner, and crime is down over the past 25 years.\n\nWe libertarians complain about today's politicians destroying our freedom and our future. And they do, with their taxes and suffocating rules and overspending.\n\nBut in spite of that, the free market has managed to make more or most of our lives less mean.\n\nAlso, if you are black or gay or a woman, America is much less mean than it was.\n\nBut fearful people often accept, and even welcome, repression that comes along with politicians' promise to protect us. But we don't need more protection. The world is less mean now.\n\nfoxbusiness[.]com/on-air/stossel/blog/2014/10/01/violence-america\n\n\nINFO:\n-----\nRipped with the Diamond VC500. Using the software that came packaged with the dongle. (It's called EZ Ripper.) In that software there's a &quot;DVD Standard&quot; which rips the video to .mpg at 720x480 with some terrible black bars. I load that file into AVIDemux. Cut the file into multiple parts to remove the commercials. Rejoin, crop, and resize those files using the same tool. For conversion I used MPEG4 AVC (x264), 2 pss on video and AAC (faac) on audio. File size limited to 350MB. (310 video 40 audio.\n\nI am not part of the scene. I just admire their naming standards.\n\nGeneral \nComplete name : J:MediaBrianTelevisionStosselStossel Season 05Stossel.2014.10.02.Its.A.Mean.Mean.World.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4 \nFormat : MPEG-4 \nFormat profile : Base Media \nCodec ID : isom \nFile size : 351 MiB \nDuration : 41mn 3s \nOverall bit rate : 1 194 Kbps \nWriting application : Lavf54.63.104 \n\nVideo \nID : 1 \nFormat : AVC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec \nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2f674648476f631c011f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes \nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames \nCodec ID : avc1 \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding \nDuration : 41mn 3s \nBit rate : 1 055 Kbps \nWidth : 720 pixels \nHeight : 404 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Variable \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nMinimum frame rate : 9.990 fps \nMaximum frame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.121 \nStream size : 310 MiB (88%) \nWriting library : x264 core 123 r2189 35cf912 \nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1055 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \n\nAudio \nID : 2 \nFormat : AAC \nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec \nFormat profile : LC \nCodec ID : 40 \nDuration : 41mn 3s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L R \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 37.6 MiB (11%) \nLanguage : unk \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf7e8682537394956a342c4fa7047eb9cc5bc24","amp;dn":"Stossel.2014.10.02.Its.A.Mean.Mean.World.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf7e8682537394956a342c4fa7047eb9cc5bc24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,247,232,104,37,55,57,73,86,163,66,196,250,112,71,235,156,197,188,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
