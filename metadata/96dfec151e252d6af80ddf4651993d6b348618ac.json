The band was known for the complexity and sophistication of its music and for the varied musical skills of its members. All of the band members, except the first two drummers, were multi-instrumentalists. Although not commercially successful, they did achieve a cult following.\nGentle Giant's music was considered complex even by progressive rock standards, drawing on a broad swathe of music including folk, soul, jazz, and classical music. Unlike many of their progressive rock contemporaries, their &quot;classical&quot; influences ranged beyond the Romantic and incorporated mediaeval, baroque and modernist chamber music elements. The band also had a taste for broad themes for their lyrics, drawing inspiration not only from personal events but from philosophy and the works of both Francois Rabelais and R.D. Laing.\n[from Wikipedia]\n\n[b]Band Line-up:[/b]\nDerek Shulman - lead vocals, saxophone, recorder, keyboards, bass, drums, percussion, &quot;Shulberry&quot; (3-string custom electric ukulele[24]) (1970-1980)\nRay Shulman - bass, trumpet, violin, vocals, viola, drums, percussion, recorder, guitar (1970-1980)\nKerry Minnear - keyboards, lead vocals (on recordings only), cello, vibraphone, xylophone, recorder, guitar, bass, drums (1970-1980)\nGary Green - guitar, mandolin, vocals, recorder, bass, drums, xylophone (1970-1980)\nPhil Shulman - lead vocals, saxophone, trumpet, clarinet, recorder, percussion (1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“72)\nMartin Smith - drums, percussion (1970ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1971)\nMalcolm Mortimore - drums, percussion (1971ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1972)\nJohn &quot;Pugwash&quot; Weathers - drums, percussion, vibraphone, xylophone, vocals, guitar (1972-1980)\n\n[b]Links:[/b]\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- AVAILABLE DISCOGRAPHY FOR THIS COMPILATION:\nGENTLE GIANT - 1970_Gentle Giant\nGENTLE GIANT - 1971_Acquiring the Taste\nGENTLE GIANT - 1972_Octopus\nGENTLE GIANT - 1972_Three Friends\nGENTLE GIANT - 1973_In A Glass House\nGENTLE GIANT - 1974_The Power And The Glory\nGENTLE GIANT - 1975_Free Hand\nGENTLE GIANT - 1976_Interview\nGENTLE GIANT - 1977_Playing The Fool\nGENTLE GIANT - 1977_The Missing Piece\nGENTLE GIANT - 1978_Giant For A Day\nGENTLE GIANT - 1980_Civilian\n\n- COVER IMAGES\nThe original cover art (for the single/LP or CD) is included in the Info Tag of the mp3 file\n\n- LYRICS\nLyrics are included in the torrent (PDF file)\n\n-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI would like to thank all the beautiful web sites from which I &quot;leeched&quot; all the information, images and lyrics.
