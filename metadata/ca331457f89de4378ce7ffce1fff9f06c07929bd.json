As the curtain rises, we find Goon writer and godfather of alternative comedy Spike Milligan going gaga from the strain of creating comic genius.  Wild fantasies of Jewish leprechauns, gay Vikings, and malevolent Morris dancers are springing from his fragmented brain.  Fellow Goons, including future Dr. Strangelove Peter Sellers, scramble to recover Milligan's missing marbles and save his sanity...\n\nOne episode of approximately 45 minutes.\n\nWith:\nSpike Milligan........James Clyde\nHarry Secombe........Kai Owen\nPeter Sellers........Toby Longworth\nWallace Greenslade........Benedick Blythe\n\nProduced by Liz Anstee and directed by Roy Smiles.\n\nFirst broadcast on 4th April 2007 on BBC Radio 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca331457f89de4378ce7ffce1fff9f06c07929bd","amp;dn":"Ying+Tong+-+A+Walk+with+the+Goons++%28BBC+Drama+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca331457f89de4378ce7ffce1fff9f06c07929bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,51,20,87,248,157,228,55,140,231,255,206,31,255,159,6,192,121,41,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
