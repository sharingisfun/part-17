It is written by Phil Vischer. It is the first VeggieTales episode released in 2009. It is also the first VeggieTales episode to use the title's new logo. The Silly Song in this episode is &quot;Sneeze if You Need To&quot;.\n\n[edit] Plot\n\nJunior Asparagus is anxious for the new show production to be finished. Bob the Tomato responds to a fan's letter about &quot;waiting&quot; by directing a Bible-times interview with Abraham, Sarah (voiced by Delilah) and their promised son, Isaac. Like in Josh and the Big Wall!, Bob and Junior use imagination to travel. Their patience is tested by splitting camels, a confused nurse, an easily distracted film crew, and others. This episode's second segment is &quot;Blunders in Boo-Boo-Ville&quot;. It is nearing the time of the great ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBoo-Boo-Bird Festival,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but there havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been any Boo-Boo Birds spotted in the town for a long time. The festival is in danger of being canceled if the townÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s residents canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come up with a way to attract the birds back to their city. Jacques (Larry the Cucumber) learns a tough lesson about taking his time to make sure things are done correctly when an attempt to bring back the boo-boo birds doesn't go as smoothly as hoped. One of his inventions gone awry creates a rift in his friendship with Maurice (Bob the Tomato), and he must embark on his next task alone. He learns his lesson from a scientist and inventor named Leon Merengue (Charlie Pincher). Madame Blueberry appears as the town's mayor.\n\n\n\nMP4\nIPOD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:856c432060fba66f19de863014b986cd59694375","amp;dn":"%28Ipod%29+Veggie+Tales+Abe+and+the+Amazing+Promise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"856c432060fba66f19de863014b986cd59694375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,108,67,32,96,251,166,111,25,222,134,48,20,185,134,205,89,105,67,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
