The music is somehow folk, but also cosmic rock inspired, reminiscent of Ash ra temple and Cosmic jokers, thanks to Shultze's influence who mixed it using &quot;Artificial Head Stereo Sound&quot;, the aim was &quot;to get an illusion of perfect surrounding space. The idea was brilliant but unfortunately not the sound.&quot;. The album has indeed been pressed again three times, as the band was not satisfied with the result. Their sole album Golem, was released in 1974.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Helicopter (13:42)\n02. Old Loggerhead (8:21)\n03. May Rain (4:29)\n04. On The Corner (4:26)\n05. Sarah (10:40)\n\nBand:\n- Johannes Vester / vocals, VCS3 synthesizer, guitar\n- Ludwig Papenberg / guitar, organ electronic drums\n- Ulrich Papenberg / bass, percussion\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a5e894929816dab3aef0a1b037630a4bd1af70","amp;dn":"Sand+-+Golem+%281974%2F2010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a5e894929816dab3aef0a1b037630a4bd1af70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,165,232,148,146,152,22,218,179,174,240,161,176,55,99,10,75,209,175,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
