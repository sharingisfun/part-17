Gik\nPergammon Press December 1981 ISBN 0-08-026896-X PDF 176 pages 22.5 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Chess-Kaleidoscope-Pergamon-Russian/dp/0080268978&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Chess-Kaleidoscope-Pergamon-Russian/dp/0080268978&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe first part of this book is just a bunch of chess puzzles(some really interesting ones) with annotations authour Gik). Once in a while Karpov throws in some endgame wisdom such as triangulation(losing the tempo) and the rule of the square which might be of interest to the beginner. \nThere is a section (letter) about the best games from the World Championships.(from Steinitz until Karpov)There is also a letter on Karpov's best games and a story on how he met his co-author Gik. The book is written as a set of letters and Karpov may want the book to look letter-like. \nThere is an outdated section on computer chess. Its rather amusing to read the naive predictions(from the 80s) of how computers will never beat a grandmaster. Now computers are thrashing grandmasters 6 piece endgames perfectly. \n\n\nContents\nPART ONE - SEVEN CHESS LETTERS \nFirst Letler Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Geometry of the Chess Board\nSecond Letter Ã¢â‚¬â€ Symmetry in Chess\nThird Letter Ã¢â‚¬â€ An Ancient Mate\nFourth Letter Ã¢â‚¬â€ Forty Chess Quartets\nFifth Letter- Ã¢â‚¬â€ Trios and Duets on the Chess Board\nSixth Letter Ã¢â‚¬â€ Two Decisive Games\nSeventh Letter - Before the 30th Match for the World Championship\n\nPART TWO - THE COMPUTER AT THE CHESS BOARD\nWhy program computers to play chess?\nCompetitions with the Participation of Computers\nThe Computer Analyzes the Endgame\n\nPART THREE - FIFTEEN OF THE WORLD CHAMPION'S BEST GAMES 123\nNo. 1 Karpou-Gik, Moscow University Championship, 1968 \nNo. 2 Karpov-Hort, Moscow 1971 \nNo. 3 Karpov-Polugayevsky, Quarter-Final Candidates' Match, Moscow 1974 \nNo. 4 Karpov-Spassky, Semi-Final Candidates' Match, Leningrad 1974\nNo. 5 Karpov-Korchnoi, Final Candidates' Match, Moscow 1974 \nNo. 6 Portisch-Karpou, European Team Championship, Moscow 1977 \nNo. 7 Tlmman-Karpov, Montreal 1979 '*\nNo. 8 Karpov-HCibner, Bad Lauterberg 1980 \nNo. 9 Kar-pov-Tal, Bugojno 1980 H9\nNo. 10 Gl igoric-Karpov, Bugojno 1980\nNo. 11 Karpov-Ribl i , Amsterdam 1980\nNo. 12 Larsen-Karpov, Amsterdam 1980\nNo. 13 Karpov-5passky, Tilburg 1980\nNo. 14 Karpov-Hort, Malta Olympiad 1980\nNo. 15 Ljubojevic-Karpov, Linares 1981","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0159e28bdb144538f6a21b8fc1a8fafa57f34897","amp;dn":"Chess+Kaleidoscope+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0159e28bdb144538f6a21b8fc1a8fafa57f34897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,89,226,139,219,20,69,56,246,162,27,143,193,168,250,250,87,243,72,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
