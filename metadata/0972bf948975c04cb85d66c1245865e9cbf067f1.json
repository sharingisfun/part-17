Jay stars as a high school student who has just transferred to a new school known for its music program. He meets and falls in love with a cute and mysterious classmate (Guey Lun Mei, Blue Gate Crossing), but she has a secret that can tear them apart. A gentle mix of music and puppy love, this sweet and subtle film adds another notch to Jay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s long list of accomplishments.\n\nOther than starring, directing, and creating the story for the film, Jay also took care of the music, which plays a key role in Secret. The soundtrack comes with the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s score and four theme songs, including title theme Secret, a soft British-style rock number with moving melody and lyrics.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img260.imageshack.us/img260/7426/cover3mq8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img260.imageshack.us/img260/7426/cover3mq8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist: http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/8622/c1004975172nh7.png\n\nSAMPLE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dO6hCunTA (Track 25)\n\nPlease help seed as long as you can!!!\n\nLove for All and Sharing is the first step to solving all the problems of humanity.\n\nWebsites I want to share.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lightmiddleway.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lightmiddleway.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shareintl.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shareintl.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank you very much","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0972bf948975c04cb85d66c1245865e9cbf067f1","amp;dn":"%5BCPOP%5D+Jay+Chou+-+Secret+OST+%28Release+Date%3A+August+23%2C+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0972bf948975c04cb85d66c1245865e9cbf067f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,114,191,148,137,117,192,76,184,93,102,193,36,88,101,233,203,240,103,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
