Expertly guided by the erudite Kevin McCloud, this series takes you on seven extra-ordinary builds...from the re-birthing of a dilapidated mill complex into a sustainable and dynamic dream home... the conversion of a crumbling boathouse on a pier... to the re-interpretation of a heritage listed barn into a contemporary museum-like home.\n\n\n1)  Derelect Mill Cottage \nKevin McCloud looks at the transformation of a derelict mill cottage in Northumberland into a contemporary family home, the longest-running project ever featured on the programme. Stefan Lepkowski and Annia Shabowska began work in 2006, and their ambitious plans involved restoring the Georgian building, reconstructing a watermill and adding a steel-and-glass atrium, but their budget of Ã‚Â£250,000 was completely inadequate.\n\n2)  Contemporary Mansion \nKevin McCloud meets Paul and Penny Denby, who are demolishing their mock-Georgian home on an exclusive south London estate to replace it with a contemporary mansion. The couple have no building experience and they struggle with many design decisions, finding themselves Ã‚Â£250,000 short of the amount needed to finish the property.\n\n3)  Lifeboat Station \nKevin McCloud meets Tim and Philomena O'Donovan, who are trying to convert a lifeboat station in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, into a contemporary home and preserve the historic building for posterity. A weather-worn, rusting and rotting hulk that was never designed for habitation, it is perched on a steel pier 40ft above the sea and can only be reached by crossing the sandy beach at low tide.\n\n4)  Large Timber Framed Barn \nKevin McCloud follows the conversion of a large, Grade II-listed timber-framed barn in Essex into a family home and work-space by artists Freddie Robbins and Ben Coode-Adams. Their plans involve few interior walls to display their collection of toys, but at seven times the size of an average three-bedroom house, the transformation of the 500-year-old building proves extremely challenging.\n\n5)  Recycled Timber Framed House \nKevin McCloud meets estate manager Ed Waghorn and his wife Rowena, a couple living an almost self-sufficient life with their four children on a smallholding in Herefordshire. They have been constructing a timber-framed house using recycled materials, wood from nearby forests and stone from around the site, but as construction becomes a way of life for Ed they seem to have lost sight of their goal.\n\n6)  Dilapidated Engine House \nStonemason Adam Purchase and his partner Nicola Brennan try to restore a dilapidated Grade II-listed engine house in Cornwall, which was formerly part of a silver mine. With a budget of Ã‚Â£100,000, Adam takes a year off work to transform the property into a new home, but has to rely on favours to complete the project before he runs out of time.\n\n7)  Disco Home \nKevin McCloud meets Claire Farrow and Ian Hogarth, who are trying to construct a home containing a sauna, spa, dance floor and DJ booth on a small patch of land in London. They have applied for planning permission to include a basement and started work on the construction, but setbacks including their digger smashing into a neighbour's wall and the re-emergence of the old river under the project threaten to prevent them completing the build.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5767/sjez.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5767/sjez.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/5216/k9fi.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img268.imageshack.us/img268/5216/k9fi.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3404/to4w.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3404/to4w.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9179/ei9x.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/9179/ei9x.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5900/spci.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/5900/spci.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3381/h0bw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/3381/h0bw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4011/wur2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4011/wur2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/8096/0xah.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/8096/0xah.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/266/zory.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/266/zory.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2545/l7gu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2545/l7gu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1938/xasa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/1938/xasa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/8809/ei5s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/8809/ei5s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;743c1d131c3438475a44&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1819 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 46mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 7\n * Part Size: 645 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Release Notes\n * Merged subtitles\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.granddesignsmagazine.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e298d658a1a8eb5dfc68f7ef5a3ae439d5cc5a","amp;dn":"Ch4+Grand+Designs+Collection+10+7of7+The+Disco+Home+DVDRip+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e298d658a1a8eb5dfc68f7ef5a3ae439d5cc5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,226,152,214,88,161,168,235,93,252,104,247,239,90,58,228,57,213,204,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
