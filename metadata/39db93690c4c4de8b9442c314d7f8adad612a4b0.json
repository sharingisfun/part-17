This is a compilation of his first two books which were finally edited for error and published with additional Chapters as &quot;Patriots&quot;. This was the shareware version which Jim Rawles has been very successful in getting the internet copies removed so as to not cut into the Sales of Patriots. This version doesn't have all the supply descriptions and links as does &quot;Patriots&quot;. \n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Rawles, once something is on the internet, it is forever. I ask that you help spread this version. Send Mr. Rawles $5.00 which is his asking price for this piece of shareware if you think it deserves it. The publishing errors are many but if you can get past that, it is a decent piece of Fiction. \n\n\nThe Pirate Bay Lives.
