Nastiest: the Delta-styled &quot;Too Much Seconal&quot; and &quot;Ain't Nothing to Me,&quot; dedicated to the subversive notion that sometimes the impassivity of country music is a little sadistic. White blues lives: the best and heaviest track is a Hoodoo Rhythm Devils song.&quot; B+\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b21ae0b12f9f1d99765b8951ba7356b6e4b798ad","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+-+Still+Alive+and+Well+%281973+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b21ae0b12f9f1d99765b8951ba7356b6e4b798ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,26,224,177,47,159,29,153,118,91,137,81,186,115,86,182,228,183,152,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
