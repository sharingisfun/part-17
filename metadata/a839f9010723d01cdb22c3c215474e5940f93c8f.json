(1991)\n\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Soul Brother Number One,&quot; &quot;the Godfather of Soul,&quot; &quot;the Hardest Working Man in Show Business,&quot; &quot;Mr. Dynamite&quot; -- those are mighty titles, but no one can question that James Brown earned them more than any other performer. Other singers were more popular, others were equally skilled, but few other African-American musicians were so influential over the course of popular music. And no other musician, pop or otherwise, put on a more exciting, exhilarating stage show: Brown's performances were marvels of athletic stamina and split-second timing. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.25% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tPolydor\nCatalogue:\t\t314 511 326-2\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.I Got You (I Feel Good)\n02.Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine, Pt. 1\n03.I Got The Feelin'\n04.MotherPt. 1\n05.Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\n06.Make It Funky, Pt. 1\n07.Papa's Got A Brand New Bag, Pt. 1\n08.Think\n09.It's A Man's Man's Man's World\n10.Try Me\n11.Night Train\n12.Cold Sweat, Pt. 1\n13.Get On The Good Foot\n14.Papa Don't Take No Mess, Pt. 1\n15.The Payback\n16.Say It Loud (I'm Black And I'm Proud), Pt. 1\n17.Super Bad, Pts. 1 &amp; 2\n18.Hot Pants, Pt. 1\n19.Get Up Offa That Thing\n20.Please, Please, Please\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a839f9010723d01cdb22c3c215474e5940f93c8f","amp;dn":"James+Brown+-+20+All+Time+Greatest+Hits%21+1991+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a839f9010723d01cdb22c3c215474e5940f93c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,57,249,1,7,35,208,28,219,34,195,194,21,71,78,89,64,249,60,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
