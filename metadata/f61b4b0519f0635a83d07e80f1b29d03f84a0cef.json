Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries. \\&quot;What if Cannabis Cured Cancer\\&quot; explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies, and when pot is consumed, the \\&quot;endocannabinoids\\&quot; inside us, along with any cannabinoids we ingest, fit together like a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the body\\'s healthy cells. A powerful and eye-opening film about the future of cannabis, and perhaps even the future of medicine. Narrated by Emmy-winning actor Peter Coyote. \n\nQUOTES: \n\n\\&quot;What If Cannabis Cured Cancer summarizes the remarkable research findings of recent years about the cancer-protective effects of novel compounds in marijuana.
