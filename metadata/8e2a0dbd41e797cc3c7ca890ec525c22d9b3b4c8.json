Such interpretations are based on our knowledge of processes occurring on Earth Terrestrial analog studies therefore play an important role in understanding the geological features observed on Mars. This is the first book to present direct comparisons between locales on Earth and Mars, and contains contributions from leading planetary geologists to demonstrate the parallels and differences between these two neighboring planets. Mars is characterized by a wide range of geological phenomena that also occur on Earth, including tectonic, volcanic, impact cratering, eolian, fluvial, glacial and possibly lacustrine and marine processes. The book provides terrestrial analogs for newly acquired data sets from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, Mars Exploration Rovers and Mars Express, and will therefore be a key reference for students and researchers of planetary science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2a0dbd41e797cc3c7ca890ec525c22d9b3b4c8","amp;dn":"The+Geology+of+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2a0dbd41e797cc3c7ca890ec525c22d9b3b4c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,42,13,189,65,231,151,204,60,124,168,144,236,82,92,34,217,179,180,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
