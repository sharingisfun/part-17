By integrating processing methods with ultrasound and microwave irradiation into biorefineries, the time-scale of many operations can be greatly reduced while the efficiency of the reactions can be remarkably increased so that process intensification can be achieved. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Production of Biofuels and Chemicals with UltrasoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Production of Biofuels and Chemicals with MicrowaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are two independent volumes in the Biofuels and Biorefineries series that take different, but complementary approaches for the pretreatment and chemical transformation of biomass into chemicals and biofuels.\n\nThe volume Ã¢â‚¬Å“UltrasoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides current research advances and prospects in mechanistic principles of acoustic cavitation in sonochemistry, physical and chemical mechanisms in biofuel synthesis, reactor design for transesterification and esterification reactions, lipid extraction from algal biomass, microalgae extraction, biodiesel and bioethanol synthesis, practical technologies and systems, pretreatment of biomass waste sources including lignocellulosic materials, manures and sludges for biogas production, vibration-assisted pelleting, combined chemical-mechanical methods, valorization of starch-based wastes and techno-economic methodology. Each of the 12 chapters has been peer-reviewed and edited to improve both the quality of the text and the scope and coverage of the topics. Both volumes Ã¢â‚¬Å“UltrasoundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“MicrowaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are references designed for students, researchers, academicians and industrialists in the fields of chemistry and chemical engineering and include introductory chapters to highlight present concepts of the fundamental technologies and their application","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d134dae5a39abc1a791a96edbde24cbfd1130260","amp;dn":"Production+of+Biofuels+and+Chemicals+with+Ultrasound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d134dae5a39abc1a791a96edbde24cbfd1130260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,52,218,229,163,154,188,26,121,26,150,237,189,226,76,191,209,19,2,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
