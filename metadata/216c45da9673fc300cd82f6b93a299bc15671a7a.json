Great choice of songs (she wrote 5 of the 13) that let her show all her talents, both vocally and instrumentally. Slow-tempo songs display the force of her voice, as in &quot;I Still Love You,&quot; and another of the many gems, &quot;For the Love of a Man.&quot; Meanwhile, the playfulness of the title cut and &quot;The Right Tool for the Job&quot; allow her to have fun and let the band air it out. Then there is the perfect song to end the disc and an absolute tour de force, Randy Newman's &quot;Louisiana 1927.&quot;\n\nBall has again assembled another top-notch cast of characters who more than hold up their end of the bargain. A few of the many who shine are George Rains on drums, Mark Kazanoff, who does double duty as a co-producer and excels on various saxes, and Derek O'Brien, who also co-produced and shares much of the guitar work with Steve Williams. If you don't know Marcia Ball, this is a fantastic introduction, and if you liked her past work this is a gem you won't want to miss. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Let Me Play With Your Poodle\n02.
