Ostensibly James' debut album, Hunter actually follows up her 2012 Nina Simone tribute concert recording, Morgan James Live from Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola. That said, Hunter is James' first recording of all-original material and, in that sense, a much more personal statement than her live debut. Produced by jazz and bluegrass guitarist Doug Wamble, Hunter finds James delving deeply into a collection of tunes that, while not show tunes in any sense, still make clever use of her stage-honed chops. It also doesn't hurt that Wamble, an experienced musician with a wealth of musical skill and cross-genre knowledge, has assembled a backing band that features a bevy of heavyweight jazz artists, including acclaimed pianist Robert Glasper, saxophonist Ron Blake, trumpeter Ravi Best, and others. However, rather than having James focus on jazz standards or even jazz-influenced pop songs, Wamble helped the vocalist craft an R&amp;B-inflected album that brings to mind classic artists like Carole King and Hall &amp; Oates as well as more contemporary singers including BeyoncÃƒÂ© and the late Amy Winehouse. James, who made her Broadway debut in 2010 alongside Nathan Lane in The Addams Family, has a big, resonant voice with a ton of flexibility, perfectly suited for such crisp, soulful cuts as &quot;Heart Shake&quot; and &quot;Bring Yourself to Me.&quot; Elsewhere, she delves into several equally compelling bluesy midtempo numbers, including &quot;You Never Lied&quot; and &quot;Drown.&quot; Ultimately, it's that voice -- matched with Wamble's superb musical vision -- that creates the soulful, exuberant vibe of Hunter.\n\n\nHunter [43:55]\n_________________________________\n\n\n01.
