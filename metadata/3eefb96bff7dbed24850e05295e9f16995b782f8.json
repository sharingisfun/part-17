As much a follow-up to Traffic's self-titled second album as it is to Cream's final output, it merges the soulful blues of the former with the heavy riffing and outsized song lengths of the latter for a very compelling sound unique to this band. Not all of it works -- between the virtuoso electric blues of &quot;Had to Cry Today,&quot; the acoustic-textured &quot;Can't Find My Way Home,&quot; the soaring &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; (Eric Clapton's one contribution here as a songwriter, and the first great song he ever authored) and &quot;Sea of Joy,&quot; the band doesn't do much with the Buddy Holly song &quot;Well All Right&quot;; and Ginger Baker's &quot;Do What You Like&quot; was a little weak to take up 15 minutes of space on an LP that might have been better used for a shorter drum solo and more songs. \nUnfortunately, the group was never that together as a band and evidently had just the 42 minutes of new music here ready to tour behind. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eefb96bff7dbed24850e05295e9f16995b782f8","amp;dn":"1969+Blind+Faith+%26lrm%3B%26ndash%3B+Blind+Faith++Viynlrip+24bit-192khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eefb96bff7dbed24850e05295e9f16995b782f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,239,185,107,255,125,190,210,72,80,224,82,149,233,241,105,149,183,130,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
