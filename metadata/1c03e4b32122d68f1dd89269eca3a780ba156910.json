Fisher Phillips is suing the contractor who turned Union Bank in to the Federal Reserve because the original code was so shitty (memory and stack overflows everywhere, no checks). The source code is for the IceBreaker/IceSOAP projects, which manage transactions between Union Bank's mainframe COBOL code and their Oasis transaction software. It uses SOAP calls to a WSDL on the mainframe for communication, through unmanaged C++ to C# back to C++. Also contains the Kerberos server authentication code, which uses the same unmanaged C++ to C# back to C++","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c03e4b32122d68f1dd89269eca3a780ba156910","amp;dn":"UnionBankSourceCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c03e4b32122d68f1dd89269eca3a780ba156910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,3,228,179,33,34,214,143,29,216,146,105,236,163,167,128,186,21,105,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
