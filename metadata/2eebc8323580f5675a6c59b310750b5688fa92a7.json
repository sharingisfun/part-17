In particular, it deals with 3d-metal pnictides (i.e., compounds containing phosphorus, arsenic, antimony or bismuth). Part I reports the experimental data together with phenomenological discussions from fundamental and application view points. Part II addresses how some of interesting behaviors mentioned in Part I can be explained on the basis of an itinerant electron picture. Band structures obtained by first-principle calculations are applied to introduce theories to calculate various properties such as susceptibility, magnetic ordering, and magnetic transitions, etc.\n\n# Hardcover: 142 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (December 17, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3642034195\n# ISBN-13: 978-3642034190","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2eebc8323580f5675a6c59b310750b5688fa92a7","amp;dn":"Electronic+Structure+and+Magnetism%2C3d-Transition+Metal+Pnictides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2eebc8323580f5675a6c59b310750b5688fa92a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,235,200,50,53,128,245,103,90,108,89,179,16,117,11,86,136,250,146,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
