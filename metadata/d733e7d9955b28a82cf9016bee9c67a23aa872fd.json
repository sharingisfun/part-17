A P.I. helps out digging up factual information. While in nearly every episode a criminal is found out and put behind bars, after testing out tactics in Shark's private mock court, Sebastian often also has to deal with his daughter Julie, who surprisingly chose after Shark's divorce to live with him rather then her mother in New York.\n\n------------------\n\nWell enjoy\n\nGreetings\nPowerOfThePoor - POTP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d733e7d9955b28a82cf9016bee9c67a23aa872fd","amp;dn":"Shark+season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d733e7d9955b28a82cf9016bee9c67a23aa872fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,51,231,217,149,91,40,168,44,249,1,107,238,156,103,162,58,168,114,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
