It is NOT a porno.\n\nThis is my first torrent; sorry about the size but I couldn't find where to change it in the ripper I used. Quality is not great but is watchable. I ripped this from my vhs tape; I've never seen this on dvd.\n\n\n\nTen women, most of them in Vancouver or Toronto, talk about being lesbian in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: discovering the pulp fiction of the day about women in love, their own first affairs, the pain of breaking up, frequenting gay bars, facing police raids, men's responses, and the etiquette of butch and femme roles. Interspersed among the interviews and archival footage are four dramatized chapters from a pulp novel, &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;: Laura leaves her hick town and heads for the city, where she meets Mitch in a bar. Sparks fly, and so do laughter and joy. Ann Bannon, one of the writers of those paperback novels about forbidden love, talks about the genre.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdebed5cce6aad785cebcb251e6d01ecffcbe7ca","amp;dn":"Forbidden+Love%3A+the+Unashamed+Stories+of+Lesbian+Lives+AVI%2C+VHS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdebed5cce6aad785cebcb251e6d01ecffcbe7ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,235,237,92,206,106,173,120,92,235,203,37,30,109,1,236,255,203,231,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
