It was released on April 19, 2014 on Record Store Day by Third Man Records. The entire album, which consists of covers of classic songs by artists Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Gordon Lightfoot and others, was recorded in a refurbished 1947 Voice-o-Graph vinyl recording booth at Jack White's Third Man store in Nashville, Tennessee. The opening spoken-word track, and other spoken lines throughout the album, were addressed to Edna &quot;Rassy&quot; Young, Neil's mother who died in 1990.  A message on Young's website described the album as &quot;an unheard collection of rediscovered songs from the past recorded on ancient electro-mechanical technology captures and unleashes the essence of something that could have been gone forever&quot;.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;A Letter Home Intro&quot;   \t  \t2:16\n02. \t&quot;Changes&quot;   \tPhil Ochs \t3:56\n03. \t&quot;Girl from the North Country&quot;   \tBob Dylan \t3:32\n04. \t&quot;Needle of Death&quot;   \tBert Jansch \t4:57\n05. \t&quot;Early Morning Rain&quot;   \tGordon Lightfoot \t4:24\n06. \t&quot;Crazy&quot;   \tWillie Nelson \t2:16\n07. \t&quot;Reason to Believe&quot;   \tTim Hardin \t2:47\n08. \t&quot;On the Road Again&quot;   \tWillie Nelson \t2:23\n09. \t&quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;&quot;   \tGordon Lightfoot \t4:04\n10. \t&quot;Since I Met You Baby&quot;   \tIvory Joe Hunter \t2:13\n11. \t&quot;My Hometown&quot;   \tBruce Springsteen \t4:08\n12. \t&quot;I Wonder If I Care as Much&quot;   \tThe Everly Brothers \t2:29\n\n\n   - Neil Young Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, harmonica, piano\n   - Jack White Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals and piano on &quot;On the Road Again&quot; and &quot;I Wonder If I Care as Much&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:266cd3f653e63570271d62d59dcc19dbc167d430","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+A+Letter+Home+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"266cd3f653e63570271d62d59dcc19dbc167d430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,108,211,246,83,230,53,112,39,29,98,213,157,204,25,219,193,103,212,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
