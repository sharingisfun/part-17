The people he meets and travels with are fully-fledged characters that the reader comes to know and care about while the Himalaya, captured in all their variety, cast their spell. It is as if the act of walking allows the author to fully understand all the nuances-spiritual, environmental, social and politica l- of this inspiring region. A Long Walk in the Himalaya is a book to savour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:037b23176bf3150a6cee9feb3fdea506705edc2a","amp;dn":"A+Long+Walk+in+the+Himalaya%3A+A+Trek+from+the+Ganges+to+Kashmir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"037b23176bf3150a6cee9feb3fdea506705edc2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,123,35,23,107,243,21,10,108,238,159,235,63,222,165,6,112,94,220,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
