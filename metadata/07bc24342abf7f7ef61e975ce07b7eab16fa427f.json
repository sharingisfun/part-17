Crawford and Graham interview the parents of the latest girl to go missing, only to discover that her body has been returned to her bedroom and Graham suspects it is an apologetic gesture on behalf of the killer. As Graham struggles to create a profile, Crawford enlists the help of noted psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), who takes a keen interest in the case and particularly in Graham, in whom he senses a like-mind. Another girl is found, mounted on top of a deer's head in an open field with her lungs removed and Graham is convinced it is the work of someone else, a negative to show him the positives of the other crimes. Dr. Lecter is shown preparing himself a meal with meat that looks like lungs. Dr. Beverly Katz (Hettienne Park) finds a shred of metal from a pipe-threader on the clothes of the returned girl, which leads Graham and Dr. Lecter to a construction site that employs one Garrett Jacob Hobbs, who fits Graham's profile. Dr. Lecter makes a phone call to Hobbs, warning him that the FBI is onto him and he and Graham arrive at Hobbs' house just as Hobbs kills his own wife. Graham shoots Hobbs dead, but not before Hobbs slits his daughter's throat. Graham and Lecter sit with the unconscious girl in her hospital room.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bc24342abf7f7ef61e975ce07b7eab16fa427f","amp;dn":"Hannibal+S01E01+XviD+%5BJKS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bc24342abf7f7ef61e975ce07b7eab16fa427f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,188,36,52,42,191,127,126,246,30,151,92,224,123,126,171,22,250,66,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
