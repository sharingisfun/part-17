She has been an avid reader of most of her life, taking inspiration from the stories she read as a child, and the novels she devoured as an adult.\n\nSarah mainly writes speculative fiction for a Young Adult audience and has had pieces of short fiction published in the Medulla Literary Review, PANK magazine, Apex Magazine and the British Fantasy Society publication Dark Horizons. Her short story Ã¢â‚¬ËœVampires Wear ChanelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is featured in the Wyvern Publication Fangtales available here: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fangtales-Ber...\nShe is currently working on her first novel series The Blemished which is a Young Adult dystopian novel.\n==================\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Compound bustled with action and anticipation, causing my stomach to do a flip. I stopped in my tracks, realising something, something I hadn't thought of before. We were going to war, and people were going to die.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe Vanished are the forgotten: those who live beyond law or society. Mina fought for freedom. She fought for a better life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a future. But even a free world can decay.\n\nAs Mina begins her new life in the Clans she meets people with surprising knowledge about her power, knowledge that could change everything Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even her relationship with Daniel. But as she makes new friends, old friends turn against her in shocking betrayal.\n\nLife in the Compound is tough; there are ways and traditions so strange that Mina begins to suspect foul play at the very heart of her new home. Instead of leaving corruption behind in Area 14, Mina is faced with the rotten core of human nature as a Clan warlord threatens to invade the Compound. The Clans are turning against each other and Mina is stuck in the middle.\n\nThe Vanished is the second instalment in the Blemished series and follows MinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story as she continues to challenge those in power and seek out new dangers. With even more rebellion, romance and betrayal, The Vanished promises to take the reader on a roller-coaster ride of adventure and emotion.\n\nWill freedom fall?\n\nDovah.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:264f3000207329e5ca10774728da8a024e57c300","amp;dn":"Sarah+Dalton%2C+The+Vanished+YA+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"264f3000207329e5ca10774728da8a024e57c300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,79,48,0,32,115,41,229,202,16,119,71,40,218,138,2,78,87,195,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
