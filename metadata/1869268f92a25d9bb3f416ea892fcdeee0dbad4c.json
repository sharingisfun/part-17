The book includes dedicated chapters for each major subsystem, along with coverage devoted to dealing with fuel subsystems, and the basics of vehicle computer control systems. Fuel and engine management systems are discussed in generic terms to establish an understanding of typical engine systems, and there is an emphasis on fuel systems used in post-2007 diesel engines. Concluding with a chapter on diesel emissions and the means used to control them, this is a valuable resource designed to serve as a foundation for more advanced studies in diesel engine technology\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1869268f92a25d9bb3f416ea892fcdeee0dbad4c","amp;dn":"Modern+Diesel+Technology%3A+Diesel+Engines+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1869268f92a25d9bb3f416ea892fcdeee0dbad4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,105,38,143,146,162,93,155,179,244,22,234,137,47,205,238,224,219,173,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
