Leading the charge is an explosive combination of frenzied riffs, moody harmonies and visceral effects, countered by a massive rhythm section composed of combative drum work and dominating bass rhythms. Produced by Rick Rubin.\n\nSirens, industrial noise, and ultra-intense vocals from singer-programmer-guitarist Martin Cock kick off The War of Art&amp;#039;s aptly titled opening cut, &quot;A Violent Reaction&quot;, and from there this 16-cut debut from American Head Charge serves up more heavy nu-metal bolstered with intelligent, disturbing lyrics. Like Slipknot, Mudvayne, Slayer and other doomsayers, this seven-piece line-up&amp;#039;s severe musical and lyrical take on modern society is more for moshing than humming, though songs like the surprisingly melodic and dynamic &quot;Just So You Know&quot;, the spooky &quot;Fall&quot; and &quot;Effigy 23&quot; break up the grind of songs like &quot;Seamless&quot; and the pounding speed-metal onslaught of &quot;Americunt Evolving into Useless Psychic Garbage&quot;.\n\n&amp;#039;All bands want you to believe that what they say comes straight from their guts. With American Head Charge you know it&amp;#039;s true because it&amp;#039;s all out there on display&amp;#039;  Kerrang!\n\nNME (3/2/02, p.15 ) - &quot;...outstanding slab of modern heavy metal...&quot;\n\nCMJ (8/27/01, p.20) - &quot;...Aiming its cannons, grenades and shotguns at point-blank range...its spliced with programming and aggro geetars much [like] Slipknot...&quot; \n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dec67b74b187034a9e16dec0839c7d077d74717","amp;dn":"American+Head+Charge+-+The+War+Of+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dec67b74b187034a9e16dec0839c7d077d74717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,236,103,183,75,24,112,52,169,225,109,236,8,57,199,208,119,215,71,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
