John Coltrane and his Quartet (pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones) perform extended versions of &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; and &quot;Traneing In&quot; that gradually build up to great intensity. Well recorded, this European concert (of uncertain origin) is worth hearing, particularly by Coltrane collectors who already have his more essential recordings, although it does not quite live up to the label that producer Norman Granz gave it: &quot;His Greatest Concert Performance.&quot; \n\nPersonnel:\nJimmy Garrison- Bass\nMcCoy Tyner - Piano\nJohn Coltrane - Sax (Soprano), Main Performer, Sax (Tenor)\nElvin Jones - Drums\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Bye Bye Blackbird  \t(18:00)\t\n2.Traneing In (7:10)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:502ecebeda3855e3a7d4234f19c9cc96dd70d37c","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Bye+Bye+Blackbird+%281958%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"502ecebeda3855e3a7d4234f19c9cc96dd70d37c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,46,206,190,218,56,85,227,167,212,35,79,25,201,204,150,221,112,211,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
