These intellectuals have searched for instances of racism, sexism, and bigotry in our history while downplaying the greatness of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patriots and the achievements of &quot;dead white men.&quot; \nAs a result, more emphasis is placed on Harriet Tubman than on George Washington; more about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II than about D-Day or Iwo Jima; more on the dangers we faced from Joseph McCarthy than those we faced from Josef Stalin. \nA PatriotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s History of the United States corrects those doctrinaire biases. In this groundbreaking book, AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s discovery, founding, and development are reexamined with an appreciation for the elements of public virtue, personal liberty, and private property that make this nation uniquely successful. This book offers a long-overdue acknowledgment of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true and proud history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43908814542c206858440fb374941c755071f7c0","amp;dn":"A+Patriot%27s+History+of+the+United+States%3A+From+Columbus%27s+Great+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43908814542c206858440fb374941c755071f7c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,144,136,20,84,44,32,104,88,68,15,179,116,148,28,117,80,113,247,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
