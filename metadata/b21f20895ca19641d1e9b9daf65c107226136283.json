The Ed Sullivan Show is an American TV variety show that originally ran on CBS from Sunday June 20, 1948 to Sunday June 6, 1971, and was hosted by New York entertainment columnist Ed Sullivan.\n\nThe program ran on CBS every Sunday night from 8 to 9 p.m. ET (originally from 9 to 10 p.m. ET, until March 1949), and is one of the few entertainment shows to have been run in the same weekly time slot on the same network for more than two decades. Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; opera singers, popular artists, songwriters, comedians, ballet dancers, dramatic actors performing monologues from plays, and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville, and although vaudeville had died a generation earlier, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.\n\n&quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Age of Aquarius&quot; or &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;, is a medley of two songs from the musical Hair (&quot;Aquarius&quot; and &quot;The Flesh Failures (Let The Sunshine In)&quot;) written by James Rado, Gerome Ragni, and Galt MacDermot, and released as a single in 1969 by The 5th Dimension. The single held the number one position on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 becoming the first medley to ever achieve this feat and was eventually certified Platinum.\n\nThis song is listed at #57 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of all time\n\nThis song was one of the most popular songs of 1969, worldwide, and in the United States it reached the number one position on both the Billboard Hot 100 (for six weeks in April and May) and the Billboard magazine Adult Contemporaries Chart. It also reached the top of the sales charts in Canada, and elsewhere.\n\nThe recording won both the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Group for the Grammy Awards of 1970, after being published on the album The Age of Aquarius by The 5th Dimension, and also being released as a seven-inch vinyl single record.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius/Let_the_Sunshine_In&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius/Let_the_Sunshine_In&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EABdaAADF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EABdaAADF&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:57\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
