I think the 6th and 3rd symphonies, and probably the 5th, are just about the best that could ever be recorded. There might be a few that could come close to matching this set, but it's almost impossible to surpass these superb recordings. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1b662dcbafc5e5f307affd3385d3dad401528f","amp;dn":"Tchaikovsky+-+The+Complete+Symphonies+-+Karajan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1b662dcbafc5e5f307affd3385d3dad401528f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,27,102,45,203,175,197,229,243,7,175,253,51,133,211,218,212,1,82,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
