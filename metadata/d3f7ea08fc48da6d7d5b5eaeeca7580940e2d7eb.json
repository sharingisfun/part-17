Pollet built a space of sensation, putting things in line without explicit intentions. He didn't film himself more than a half of this movie, he has just ordering things (antique ruins, corrida, dead girl after the operation, factory, Horus) according with his own obsessions : darkness, morbid &amp; illuminate feeling, chaos ('when there is life, there is death and there is chaos' he seems to say) and pain. In France, Pollet was considered as a great film director after it - he gave a shock. We can't believe he's unknown in other country so, react !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f7ea08fc48da6d7d5b5eaeeca7580940e2d7eb","amp;dn":"Mediterranee+-+Jean-Daniel+Pollet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f7ea08fc48da6d7d5b5eaeeca7580940e2d7eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,247,234,8,252,72,218,109,125,91,94,174,236,167,88,9,64,226,215,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
