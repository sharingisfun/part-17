It was recorded and produced by the band and Nick Raskulinecz at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. \nOn June 10, the band released a free download of &quot;Mission Statement&quot;, which was later released as a single on iTunes. \nThe first official single, &quot;Say You'll Haunt Me&quot;, however, was released on July 6, 2010. Audio Secrecy is also the first album by the band to not feature a 'Parental Advisory' sticker and is dedicated to Slipknot bassist Paul Gray, who had died earlier in 2010. \nIt is also the band's last album to feature bassist Shawn Economaki.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Stone Sour. \nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Audio Secrecy&quot;   \t1:44\n2. \t&quot;Mission Statement&quot;   \t3:51\n3. \t&quot;Digital (Did You Tell)&quot;   \t4:01\n4. \t&quot;Say You'll Haunt Me&quot;   \t4:25\n5. \t&quot;Dying&quot;   \t3:02\n6. \t&quot;Let's Be Honest&quot;   \t3:45\n7. \t&quot;Unfinished&quot;   \t3:11\n8. \t&quot;Hesitate&quot;   \t4:17\n9. \t&quot;Nylon 6/6&quot;   \t3:39\n10. \t&quot;Miracles&quot;   \t4:08\n11. \t&quot;Pieces&quot;   \t4:31\n12. \t&quot;The Bitter End&quot;   \t3:34\n13. \t&quot;Imperfect&quot;   \t4:23\n14. \t&quot;Threadbare&quot;   \t5:47\n15. \t&quot;Hate Not Gone&quot;   \t3:51\n16. \t&quot;Anna&quot;   \t3:30\n17. \t&quot;Home Again&quot;   \t3:54\n \nTotal length:\n\t64:54\n\nPersonnel\n\nStone Sour\n\n    Corey Taylor Ã¢Ë†â€™ Lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, guitar solo on &quot;Pieces&quot;\n    James Root Ã¢Ë†â€™ Lead/rhythm guitar, keyboards\n    Josh Rand Ã¢Ë†â€™ Lead/rhythm guitar\n    Shawn Economaki Ã¢Ë†â€™ Bass\n    Roy Mayorga Ã¢Ë†â€™ Drums, percussion, piano on &quot;Say You'll Haunt Me&quot; and &quot;Nylon 6/6&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96600cf0163a7b775e5995c04177ef113ba7387f","amp;dn":"Stone+Sour+-+Audio+Secrecy+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%282010%29+AK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96600cf0163a7b775e5995c04177ef113ba7387f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,96,12,240,22,58,123,119,94,89,149,192,65,119,239,17,59,167,56,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
