It was nominated for an Academy award for best documentary.[2]\n\nThe film, which is in black and white, contains much historical footage and many interviews. Those interviewed include Harry S. Ashmore, Daniel Berrigan, Philippe Devillers, David Halberstam, Roger Hilsman, Jean Lacouture, Kenneth P. Landon, Thruston B. Morton, Paul Mus, Charlton Osburn, Harrison Salisbury, Ilya Todd, John Toller, David K. Tuck, David Werfel, and John White.\n\nProduced during the Vietnam War, the film was greeted with hostility by many audiences, with bomb threats and vandalism directed at theaters that showed it.[3]\n\nDe Antonio cites the film as his personal favorite. It features the ironic use of patriotic music, portrays Ho Chi Minh as a patriot to the Vietnamese people, and asserts that Vietnam was always a single country rather than two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df3b41ddd16cf644f1621ec37df06000b5523dc","amp;dn":"In+The+Year+of+the+PIG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df3b41ddd16cf644f1621ec37df06000b5523dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,243,180,29,221,22,207,100,79,22,33,236,55,223,6,0,11,85,35,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
