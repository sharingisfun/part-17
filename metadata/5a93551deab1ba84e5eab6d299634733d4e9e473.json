The first thing we hear is a ragged sequence of painful grunts before the camera homes in on a dark street where two figures are wrestling. A barefoot man dressed only in underpants is getting the worst of it. Then it's over. His attacker jabs him with a syringe and he's bundled into the boot of a car.\n\nThe journey that follows covers a lot of ground very fast. The car heads out of the city, on through the suburbs and into the bush until a siren is heard and the speeding driver reluctantly pulls over to be questioned by ... Bryan Brown.\n\nI've used the ellipsis because it's the closest I can get to conjuring up the sense of ceremony with which Brown is introduced. It's the cinematic equivalent of a drum roll. Starting at his belt buckle, the camera gradually travels up to the badge on his shirt and on to his chin, which is adorned by a grey goatee. Finally, he speaks - with a predictably heavy lacing of irony. The driver is told that he's very lucky to be stopped today and not tomorrow. Tomorrow is Brown's wife's 50th birthday and by way of a present, he has promised her that he will stop smoking. From this it's clear that the only thing which has saved the driver from a speeding fine is the calming influence of nicotine.\n\nIt's an impressive - if not exactly original - bit of swaggering but you have to wait quite a while for the follow-up because Cactus is basically a two-hander in which Brown's Rosco, the cop, makes only a few brief but pivotal appearances. The real stars of the show are Travis McMahon's John Kelly, the driver, and his bruised and baffled prisoner, Eli (David Lyons), who spends a substantial part of the trip wondering what he's done to warrant being bound, gagged and thrown into a car boot by a man he has never seen before.\n\nThe gag eventually comes off. He's also freed from the boot and pitched onto the car's back seat. His captor wants to prevent him from starving or suffocating before he's delivered to the mystery men who have commissioned the abduction. Equally pressing is the script's need to generate some conversation, for even a minimalist crime movie such as this one needs a few words of dialogue.\n\nIt's easy to see why first-time directors are attracted to this kind of thing. If they're clever enough, they can use speed and ingenuity to make up for a small budget. As well, no-frills action represents the purest form of cinema - irresistible to any young filmmaker who feels an urge to play around with an audience's collective nervous system. Get the engineering right and the resulting momentum takes care of the rest. That's the theory, anyway, and Steven Spielberg proved it eloquently enough with Duel. But that was Spielberg. It was also 36 years ago. Since then, Tarantino and the Coen Brothers have come along and given us a taste for something more - suspense plus the snap and crackle of humanity at its most colourful.\n\nSee_Me_Torrents'n_Seed _Me_Torrents.\n\nEnjoy !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a93551deab1ba84e5eab6d299634733d4e9e473","amp;dn":"Cactus+2008.DVDRip.H.263.DivX+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a93551deab1ba84e5eab6d299634733d4e9e473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,147,85,29,234,177,186,132,229,234,182,210,153,99,71,51,212,233,228,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
