He hired two drummers, Per Eklund (Lykke Li, Miike Snow) and Ola Hultgren (Loney Dear, thus Owls) to play together on most of the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs. Martin Hederos (Soundtrack Of Our Lives, Tonbruket) was behind the organs. A large part of what takes place in the musical arrangements is due to the interaction between the evocative rhythm section and HederosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ soaring piano. Froberg only wanted bass on a single song, creating space and movement for AneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exceptional voice, which was flanked by, among others, the sisters from First Aid Kid (Do You Remember) and JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez (Worship).Some of the songs were completed by January 2011, but most have been written in AneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing studio in Stockholm in the January / February period of 2011. It was at this time that the Arab revolution started and Ane spoke of how affected she was by the courage and energy that people showed the world.It All Starts With One explored the dynamics involved in trying to find balance between embracing the independent without feeling lonely, and to keep oneself and ones core intact, whilst wanting to help someone in need. The album also includes a encouraged dose of passionate love, a celebration of language, a carnival of words and an attempt at reconciliation\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/12/13/tobias-froberg/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a5383141571c113a73e03b23006dd47091bd9d9","amp;dn":"Ane+Brun...It+All+Starts+With+One%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a5383141571c113a73e03b23006dd47091bd9d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,83,131,20,21,113,193,19,167,62,3,178,48,6,221,71,9,27,217,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
