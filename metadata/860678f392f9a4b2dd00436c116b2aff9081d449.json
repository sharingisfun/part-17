Less clear will be the fate of the New Christy Minstrels. The group received precious little respect in folk circles in their own time, despite the fact that -- to a significant number of casual listeners -- the Christys were the most familiar folk group in America. After the Kingston Trio and Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, the Christys' recordings spun on more turntables at the time than any other folk group in America.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-new-christy-minstrels-p2089/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-new-christy-minstrels-p2089/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):\n\nThe Christys scored their biggest seller with their fourth album, which also contained their biggest hit single, Barry McGuire's &quot;Green, Green.&quot; The album was also their artistic high-water mark. Their arrangements were never more stirring and their singing never lustier, as Barry Kane and McGuire made their marks as soloists.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r96760&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r96760&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DRVE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000DRVE&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
