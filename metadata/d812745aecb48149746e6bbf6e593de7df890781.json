In his case, this is a collection of military war-gaming enthusiasts, some tiny painted pewter soldiers, his terrifying Czech mother and the mysterious Mr Demjanjuk.\n\n www.comedy.co.uk Review: \nWhen On The Blog first made its debut on Radio 2 we must confess we didn't bother listening to it - as the premise made it sound like another middle-of-the-road boring and ill-informed comedy programme attacking the internet. We were wrong - it's actually a rather good sitcom, albeit with a poorly chosen title.\n\n On The Blog is essentially just a funny sitcom about a rather sad middle-aged man, still living at home with his mother, who spends most of his time typing out his petty and insignificant thoughts on the internet.\n\n The character of Andrew Glasgow is a fantastic creation by the writers, and has been brought to life brilliantly by actor Andy Taylor, so we're really glad it's now back on the radio for a third series.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cast:\n Andy Taylor\n Caroline Quentin\n Simon Greenall\n Denica Fairman\n Kris Dyer\n Dave Marks\n\n Writers:\n Kris Dyer, Dave Marks, Andy Taylor\n\n\n On The Blog - S01 - E01 - You Can't Hurry Love \n On The Blog - S01 - E02 - The First Casualty Of War \n On The Blog - S01 - E03 - An Englishman's Home \n On The Blog - S01 - E04 - Wolfie And Beatie \n On The Blog - S01 - E05 - Into The Valley Of Debt \n On The Blog - S01 - E06 - The Long March Home \n\n On The Blog - S02 - E01 - Virgins And Philistines \n On The Blog - S02 - E02 - Operation Chastise \n On The Blog - S02 - E03 - Love And Grenades \n On The Blog - S02 - E04 - A Darned Close Run Thing \n On The Blog - S02 - E05 - Del Du Jour \n On The Blog - S02 - E06 - It's A PC World ( &lt;&lt;&lt; Never Aired )\n\n On The Blog - S03 - E01 - Leaving Home\n On The Blog - S03 - E02 - Local Economy \n On The Blog - S03 - E03 - Off-Piste \n On The Blog - S03 - E04 - Missionary Work \n On The Blog - S03 - E05 - Mysterious Stranger \n On The Blog - S03 - E06 - Returning Home\n\n\n Audio Format : MP3\n Duration Approx : 28mn 54s\n Bit rate mode : Constant\n Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n Channel(s) : 2 channels\n Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n Resolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d812745aecb48149746e6bbf6e593de7df890781","amp;dn":"On+The+Blog+-+S01+to+03+-+Sitcom+-+128k+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d812745aecb48149746e6bbf6e593de7df890781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,18,116,90,236,180,129,73,116,110,107,191,110,89,61,231,223,137,7,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
