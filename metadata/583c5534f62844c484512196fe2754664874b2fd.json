This isnâ€™t science fiction; in a few short years, it could be a fact of life.\r\nSpychips takes readers into the frightening world of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). While manufacturers and the government want you to believe that they would never misuse the technology, the future looks like an Orwellian nightmare when you consider the possibilities of surveillance and tracking these chips embody. Combining in-depth research with firsthand reporting, Spychips reveals how RFID technology, if left unchecked, could soon destroy our privacy, radically alter the economy, and open the floodgates for civil liberty abuses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583c5534f62844c484512196fe2754664874b2fd","amp;dn":"Katherine+Albrecht+-+Spychips+-+How+Major+Corporations+and+Gover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583c5534f62844c484512196fe2754664874b2fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,60,85,52,246,40,68,196,132,81,33,150,254,39,84,102,72,116,178,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
