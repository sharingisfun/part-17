Katherine Giuffre writes with insight and verve.Ã¢â‚¬Â² Ronald Breiger, University of Arizona Ã¢â‚¬Â²Forty years ago, people thought of community as a neighborhood. Now social networks have busted the boundaries of communities. They are farÃ¢â‚¬â€œflung and much more than villageÃ¢â‚¬â€œlike solidarities. The Internet and Mobile Revolutions have pushed these processes even further: community is now in our pocket and on our screens. Communities have become networks; networks have become communities. Katherine Giuffre tells this story well, and supplies solid evidence to clinch the tale.Ã¢â‚¬Â² Barry Wellman, University of Toronto\nProduct Description\n\nIn Communities and Networks, Katherine Giuffre takes the science of social network analysis and applies it to key issues of living in communities, especially in urban areas, exploring questions such as: How do communities shape our lives and identities? How do they foster either conformity or innovation? What holds communities together and what happens when they fragment or fall apart? How is community life changing in response to technological advances?\n\nRefreshingly accessible and built on fascinating case examples, this unique book provides not only the theoretical grounding necessary to understand how and why the burgeoning area of social network analysis can be useful in studying communities, but also clear technical explanations of the tools of network analysis and how to gather and analyze real-world network data. Network analysis allows us to see community life in a new perspective, with sometimes surprising results and insights, and this book enables readers to gain a deeper understanding of social life and the relationships that build (and break) communities.\nThis engaging text will be an exciting new resource for upper-level undergraduate and beginning graduate students in a wide range of courses including social network analysis, community studies, urban studies, organizational studies, and quantitative methods. \n\nPublisher: Polity; 1 edition (12 April 2013)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00CD6VQFC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdcdfeac3d86325234e6a5e309f72ea9a4e05580","amp;dn":"%5BKatherine+Giuffre%5DCommunities+and+Networks+Using+Social+Network","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdcdfeac3d86325234e6a5e309f72ea9a4e05580","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,205,254,172,61,134,50,82,52,230,165,227,9,247,46,169,164,224,85,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
