Former Buzzcock Howard Devoto leads his ensemble through a set that primarily draws on REAL LIFE ('78) and THE CORRECT USE OF SOAP ('80), including fierce art-rock classics such as &quot;The Light Pours Out of Me&quot; and &quot;A Song From Under the Floorboards.&quot; Like its peers Wire, the group doesn't disappoint in concert, with Barry Adamson (later of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) providing a potent bass rumble and temporary guitarist Robin Simon (Ultravox) applying dynamic six-string flourishes. Though PLAY is primarily geared towards Magazine completists, it should easily appeal to many other post-punk diehards.\n\nMagazine: Howard Devoto (vocals); Robin Simon (guitar); Dave Formula (keyboard); Barry Adamson (bass guitar); John Doyle (drum)\n\n\n\n 1.
