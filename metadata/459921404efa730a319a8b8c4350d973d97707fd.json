Outroduction\n\nReview from AMG:\nTaking their moniker from a Gilles Peterson quote, brothers Yoshihiro and Shuya Okino first caught the ear of the downtempo glitterati through a series of releases for Compost which successfully blended &amp;#039;70s fusion with broken beats and bossa cool. Their debut album continues from where these singles left off, with shimmering keywork playing amongst fatback bass and a set of talented vocalists. Despite the occasional falter on to the wrong side of the faux-jazz tracks -- Victor Davies sounding more Alexander O&amp;#039;Neil than nu soul sensation with the excruciating lyrics of &quot;Deep in Your Mind,&quot; while the brass of &quot;Between the Lights&quot; elegantly captures the spirit of thankfully long-lost &amp;#039;80s jazz romantic Kenny G. -- on the whole this is a well-rounded first full-length outing. Vanessa Freeman proves a fantastic talent, her vocal plunged into a sensuous mix of Rhodes in &quot;The Brightness of These Days,&quot; while the brothers&amp;#039; broken beat instrumentals swirl convincingly behind complex arrangements and softly spoken keys. A highlight comes in Guida de Palma&amp;#039;s delicious bossa shuffler &quot;Shine.&quot;\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459921404efa730a319a8b8c4350d973d97707fd","amp;dn":"Kyoto+Jazz+Massive+-+Spirit+Of+The+Sun%5BFLAC+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459921404efa730a319a8b8c4350d973d97707fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,153,33,64,78,250,115,10,49,154,139,140,67,80,217,115,217,119,7,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
