The game featured a 3-D environment which allowed the player to rotate (as opposed to Rocket Science's earlier production Obsidian in which the camera was usually fixed), and a humorous cast of aliens in the framework of a mystery. The player fills the role of a detective, interacting with characters and objects via a first-person interface. The name itself is a pun, as the game takes place in a bar in outer space--literally a &quot;space bar&quot; rather than the space bar found on a computer's keyboard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b73515f0f9df865f7ad189f4aec6ab2dd8fb2af","amp;dn":"The+Space+Bar+-+Steve+Meretzky+Segasoft+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b73515f0f9df865f7ad189f4aec6ab2dd8fb2af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,115,81,95,15,157,248,101,247,173,24,159,74,236,106,178,221,143,178,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
