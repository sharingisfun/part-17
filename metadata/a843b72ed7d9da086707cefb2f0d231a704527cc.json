Survival is a blood quest, and lethal force the means to power. Still, a handful retains their humanity among thecoldhearts, and in a world where nothing lasts forever, hope is a commodity as precious as jack. \n\nDIVIDE AND CONQUER \n\nSteeped in beauty and mysticism, the canyons of Mesa Verde, Colorado, survived the blast that altered the American west. Hired to track a group of missing children, Ryan Cawdor and his band follow the trail to a legendary city carved in stone, older and stronger than the nukecaust. The inhabitants of the palaces of light are more than warriors and survivors; they are masters of mind games that prey on illusion. And true believers in a metaphysical end game poised to push the companions over the edge of reality...into certain death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a843b72ed7d9da086707cefb2f0d231a704527cc","amp;dn":"James+Axler-+Palaces+of+Light+%28Deathlands+104%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a843b72ed7d9da086707cefb2f0d231a704527cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,67,183,46,215,217,218,8,103,7,206,251,47,13,35,26,112,69,39,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
