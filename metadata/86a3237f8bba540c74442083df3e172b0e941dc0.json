Although the band were formed in an era when punk rock reigned, Dire Straits worked within the conventions of classic rock, albeit with a stripped-down sound that appealed to modern audiences weary of the overproduced stadium rock of the 1970s (see 1970s in music). In their early days, Mark and David requested that pub owners turn down the amps so that patrons could converse while the band played ? indicative of their unassuming demeanor. Despite this oddly self-effacing approach to rock and roll, Dire Straits soon became hugely successful with their first album going multi-platinum globally. The band&amp;#039;s best-known songs include &quot;Sultans of Swing,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; &quot;Private Investigations,&quot; &quot;Money for Nothing,&quot; &quot;Walk of Life,&quot; &quot;Your Latest Trick,&quot; &quot;Heavy Fuel,&quot; &quot;So Far Away&quot;, and &quot;Brothers in Arms.&quot;\n\n------------\nDire Straits:\nIs the self-titled debut album by British rock band Dire Straits, released in 1978 (see 1978 in music). The album was noted for the single &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, which was a US hit a full five months after the album was released. It was later remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue on September 19, 2000.\n\nTrack listing\n\n&quot;Down to the Waterline&quot; ? 3:55 \n&quot;Water of Love&quot; ? 5:23 \n&quot;Setting Me Up&quot; ? 3:18 \n&quot;Six Blade Knife&quot; ? 4:10 \n&quot;Southbound Again&quot; ? 2:58 \n&quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; ? 5:47 \n&quot;In the Gallery&quot; ? 6:16 \n&quot;Wild West End&quot; ? 4:42 \n&quot;Lions&quot; ? 5:05 \n\nReleased October 1978 \nRecorded February 1978 at Basing St. Studios, London \nGenre Rock \nLength 41:34 \nLabel Warner Bros.
