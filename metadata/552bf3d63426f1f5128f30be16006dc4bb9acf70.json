After having a creative discussion with director Alfonso CuarÃƒÂ³n, Price began coming up with a template of sounds and noises that eventually led to him being hired as the film's composer. As work began on the film's score, CuarÃƒÂ³n and Price set ground rules for distancing the score from conventional Hollywood-style action scores such as omitting the use of percussion.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ordinarily in an action film youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re often competing with explosions and god knows what else, whereas with this [movie] music could do things a different way,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Price. Ã¢â‚¬Å“With everything we did we would try and look beyond the normal way of doing things.some of the action sequences where there are explosions, I knew that those explosions had to be inherent.The score was recorded in small groups or single instruments as opposed to a collective orchestra in order for each sound to be electronically processed and mixed individually to create a layered and surrounding effect.\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01.
