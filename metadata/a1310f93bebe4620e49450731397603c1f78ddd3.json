Bear Family Records. Remastered.\n\n\nLook closely at the cover credit on Bear FamilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second Buck Owens box, Open Up Your Heart: the subtitle makes clear this is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Buck Owens &amp; the Buckaroos Recordings 1965-1968,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which means this seven-disc set is not limited to recordings where Buck sings lead. Everything the Buckaroos made without Buck is here along with all of his studio sessions from those four years, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a ton of music: a total of 12 albums released under BuckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name, along with several cuts that would appear on 1969ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Tall Dark Stranger, plus the six LPs the Buckaroos cut during that time and a handful of alternate takes capped off by session tapes that eat up the bulk of the setÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seventh disc. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 249 tracks cut over a scant four years, the massive output proof of the huge popularity of Buck Owens &amp; the Buckaroos in the late ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s. During this period most of BuckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s LPs reached the top of the country charts -- if not, they came close, never dipping below number five -- and so did most of his singles, with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBefore You Go,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBuckaroo,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOnly You (Can Break My Heart),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen Up Your Heart,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThink of Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWaitinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in Your Welfare Line,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Place,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere Does the Good Times Go,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYour Tender Loving Care,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow Long Will My Baby Be GoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ all reaching number one. When a formula is working so well thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no incentive to change, so Owens &amp; the Buckaroos didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, choosing to build their brand in other areas, notably those Buckaroos solo albums but also putting a Bakersfield stamp on two Christmas albums and two gospel albums (one not seeing release until 1970), while also cutting two instrumental albums of his own and two live albums, neither of which are here because theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re outside of the studio-specific scope of this set. Such strict adherence to formula means there is a lot of virtuosity but not much variety on Open Up Your Heart, particularly when compared to the restless exploration Merle Haggard displayed on his Capitol recordings during the same era. Basically, Buck &amp; the Buckaroos locked into a high gear and never shifted, churning out music of a consistently high quality that only veers off track toward the end, when fuzz guitars are introduced into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Gonna Mow Your Grass.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Apart from that, this is clean, crisp Bakersfield country performed by the band that did it best, the only flaw being that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a little bit much to take in an extended sitting. So, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t listen to all seven discs of Open Up Your Heart at once -- sample liberally, a disc at a time, and Buck &amp; the Buckaroos still sound singular instead of sounding a little samey.
