The Victorian Way.\nDavid Heathcote uses a 1887 Baedeker Guide to explore modern-day Britain, discovering hidden treasures popular with Victorian tourists but rarely visited today. He discovers 'the most fashionable of Welsh watering places' before taking a trip to the salt mines and visiting Manchester, recommended by Baedeker as a hotbed of music, politics and radical thinking. The journey ends in York where modern day tourists follow in the footsteps of their Victorian counterparts.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hw3yr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hw3yr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nSRT available at MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e554e596cec525019158d2982e75da5379a11adb","amp;dn":"BBC+Touring+Britain+1of2+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e554e596cec525019158d2982e75da5379a11adb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,84,229,150,206,197,37,1,145,88,210,152,46,117,218,83,121,161,26,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
