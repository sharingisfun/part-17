Beginning as a part of his newscasts during the Second World War and then premiering as its own series on the ABC Radio Networks on May 10, 1976, The Rest of the Story consisted of stories presented as little-known or forgotten facts on a variety of subjects with some key element of the story (usually the name of some well-known person) held back until the end. The broadcasts always concluded with a variation on the tag line &quot;And now you know the rest of the story.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d94c6307ae01d20e72ea686c4471b0c8d4aa12f0","amp;dn":"Paul+Harvey+-+The+Rest+of+the+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d94c6307ae01d20e72ea686c4471b0c8d4aa12f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,76,99,7,174,1,210,14,114,234,104,108,68,113,176,200,212,170,18,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
