One hesitates at the thought of pumping further caffeine into the timbale-pummelling Puente or his cohorts on congas, guiros, bongos, and assorted other percussion. Listeners who think a computer is necessary to play as fast as the beats would get in 90&amp;#039;s jungle music had better check this man&amp;#039;s hands out. Highlight track is, hands down, the unforgettable &quot;Witchdoctor&amp;#039;s Nightmare,&quot; a great way to start off the sounds at any party. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01.
