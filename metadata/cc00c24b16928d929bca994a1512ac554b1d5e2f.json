Tabu Ley was decidedly a modernizer, the first Congolese singer to use a trap drum kit, to develop a choreographed stage show, and to perform at ParisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prestigious Oympia Theatre (1970). These 29 tracks are selected from hundreds Tabu Ley recorded during his first 16 years. As Braun points out, Tabu LeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s penchant for modernity sometimes led him in unfortunate directions, particularly after this period. The work this singer is best known for internationally is a mixed bag. This well chosen selection is a pot of gold by comparison, and really clarifies exactly why he remains such a towering figure in Congo music.\n\nEAC rip,log cue images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc00c24b16928d929bca994a1512ac554b1d5e2f","amp;dn":"Tabu+Ley+%28Rochereau%29+The+Voice+of+Lightness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc00c24b16928d929bca994a1512ac554b1d5e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,0,194,75,22,146,141,146,155,202,153,74,21,18,172,85,75,29,94,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
