Not since In Cold Blood or Helter Skelter has a true story been written with all the harrowing suspense and verve of a detective story.\n\nThis is an important as well as a chilling and exciting story, with implications that go beyond its particular events. It is the true account of five Black men who held a city in a 179-day grip of terror Provoked and guided by their leaders, these men randomly selected for kidnap, rape, robbery, mutilation and murder, 23 victims from the streets of San Francisco Ã¢â‚¬â€ any street, any time. Calling themselves Death Angels, they set a goal: to sacrifice nine &quot;blue-eyed devils&quot; each, for their God, Allah.\n\nUsing every avenue open to the research journalist (and some known only to the author himself) Ã¢â‚¬â€ records, reports, witnesses, surviving victims, relations, even the convicted men themselves, and the informer who risked a nightmare death to stop the killings Ã¢â‚¬â€ Howard has probed as deeply into the minds of murderers as anyone is ever likely to go. He shows us frenzied men, killing in the name of a religion that is teaching them white hatred. And he takes us into the shadows of their deepest secrets: their insecurities about color, their desire for respect, their burning ambition to rise above their status. He shows us killers as we have never seen them: caught up in a clash between right and wrong, black and white, life and death. And finally, in crime writing at its finest, he details the exhaustive police work by Detectives Gus Coreris and John Fotinos as they struggle against time and odds to track down the killers and trace the gun that will lead to conviction. The pace of fiction, the chronology of truth is at the heart of this controversial, sensational story. As with all great crime stories, Zebra is also a work of profound meaning which reminds us not only what evil we are capable of but especially what we are capable of on behalf of a cause, a political or religious commitment larger than ourselves.\n\n405 pages\nPublisher: Richard Marek Pubs\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0399900500\nISBN-13: 978-0399900501","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3346fb1bb8e8d2dc657cd70b950c20131ec3669","amp;dn":"Zebra%3A+179+Days+of+Terror+in+San+Francisco+by+Clark+Howard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3346fb1bb8e8d2dc657cd70b950c20131ec3669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,52,111,177,187,142,141,45,198,87,205,112,185,80,194,1,49,236,54,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
