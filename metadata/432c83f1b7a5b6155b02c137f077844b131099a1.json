In an effort to keep torrent sizes reasonable, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve decided to split 1993 into two volumes. This volume includes everything Dave Matthews Band related from the 6/16/93 Flood Zone show through the end of 1993. This also marks the first volume to include a studio release. Remember Two Things was released on November 9th, 1993. A remastered re-issue including two additional, previously unreleased, studio tracks was released on June 17th, 2014. For completion purposes, both releases of Remember Two Things are included in this volume.\n\nCountless hours of research has been put into this project, ensuring the most accurate archive possible. The highest quality sources available were always used. Every file is a 320 kbps MP3, with 600x600 pixel cover art in the style of the original DMBLive cover art for non-official releases. Everything has been carefully tagged so all ID3 tags are consistent, and most importantly, correct. Please help us seed as long as you can.\n\nComing soon... Volume 4: 1994 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Part 1.
