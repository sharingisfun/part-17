S. Ramachandran investigates strange, unforgettable casesÃ¢â‚¬â€from patients who believe they are dead to sufferers of phantom limb syndrome. With a storytellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye for compelling case studies and a researcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flair for new approaches to age-old questions, Ramachandran tackles the most exciting and controversial topics in brain science, including language, creativity, and consciousness.\n\nRamachandran (A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness), director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at UCSD, explores why humans, who are &quot;anatomically, neurologically and genetically, physiologically apes,&quot; are not &quot;merely&quot; apes. While animals can communicate with sound and gesture, and chimpanzees can even use words to express immediate needs, humans have developed the ability to speak in structurally complex sentences, and often speak in metaphor. Ramachandran speculates that, as we can map another's actions and intuit their thoughts, we also map our own sensory apparatus, perceiving our surroundingsÃ¢â‚¬â€and perceiving ourselves perceiving our surroundings. We imagine the future and speculate about the past and seek to understand our place in the universe, laying the foundation for our the sense of free will; we not only envisage future actions, but are aware of their potential consequences and the responsibility for our choices. Richard Dawkins has called Ramachandran &quot;the Marco Polo of neuroscience,&quot; and with good reason. He offers a fascinating explanation of cutting-edge-neurological research that deepens our understanding of the relationship between the perceptions of the mind and the workings of the brain.\nGenre: Neuroscience, ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daf6d3eb5f13d9c7f338daa7ac75d562e9f93e47","amp;dn":"The+Tell-Tale+Brain%3A+A+Neuroscientist%27s+Quest+for+What+Makes+Us+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daf6d3eb5f13d9c7f338daa7ac75d562e9f93e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,246,211,235,95,19,217,199,243,56,218,167,172,117,213,98,233,249,62,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
