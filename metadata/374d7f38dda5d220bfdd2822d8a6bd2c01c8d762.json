After several years of lackluster results from recording various styles of country music in and around Nashville, Lynne co-wrote and recorded this album in Palm Springs, California, incorporating confessional lyrics with musical elements from blues and rock and roll. Lynne collaborated on this album with producer Bill Bottrell, who had previously worked with Sheryl Crow on her debut album, Tuesday Night Music Club.\n\nThe album is considered to be her breakout work, and the catalyst toward Lynne receiving her first career Grammy award as Best New Artist of 2000. The award came more than a decade after Lynne's debut album,\n\nformat mp3 320 kbps\n\n\n\n    1 &quot;Your Lies&quot; (Bill Bottrell, Shelby Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 2:54\n    2 &quot;Leavin'&quot; (Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:11\n    3 &quot;Life Is Bad&quot; (Bottrell, Roger Fritz, Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:18\n    4 &quot;Thought It Would Be Easier&quot; (Bottrell, Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:55\n    5 &quot;Gotta Get Back&quot; (Bottrell, Lynne, Dorothy Overstreet) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:37\n    6 &quot;Why Can't You Be?&quot; (Bottrell, Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 4:19\n    7 &quot;Lookin' Up&quot; (Bottrell, Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:28\n    8 &quot;Dream Some&quot; (Jay Joyce, Lynne, Overstreet) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 4:12\n    9 &quot;Where I'm From&quot; (Bottrell, Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:49\n   10 &quot;Black Light Blue&quot; (Bottrell, Lynne) Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374d7f38dda5d220bfdd2822d8a6bd2c01c8d762","amp;dn":"Shelby+Lynn+-I+am+Shelby+Lynn+%5B1999%5D+320+kbps.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374d7f38dda5d220bfdd2822d8a6bd2c01c8d762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,77,127,56,221,165,210,32,191,221,40,34,216,166,189,44,1,200,215,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
