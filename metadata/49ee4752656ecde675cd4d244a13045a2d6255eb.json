It is the lead-off single to an upcoming eighth studio album Get Off on the Pain to be released on March 9, 2010. It debuted at #52 in July 2009.\n\nThe song's narrator claims that he lost his lover and everything that he ever wanted &quot;today&quot; when he sees his former lover getting married to another man. He also claims that he should be happy for her, but he isn't:\n\n    Today is the happiest day of her life\n    I should be happy for her today\n    So tell me, why are these tears in my eyes?\n    I know I should be happy for her\n    But I lost everything\n    I lost everything I ever wanted today \n\nLeeann Ward of Country Universe gave the song a C+ rating, and said in her review of the song: &quot;With a moody piano to serve as the foundation for the swelling strings and over all dramatic angst, Allan sings of the pain of loosing his former lover to another man&quot;, but added, &quot;it is severely weakened by a disappointingly generic, overblown production.&quot; The 9513 critic Juli Thanki gave the song a thumbs-up; while her review describes the production as &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;, she also says, &quot;Luckily AllanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beautiful rasp rises above these shortcomings as he manages to simultaneously sound brokenhearted, regretful, and maybe just a little pissed off.&quot; Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also gave a favorable review, saying &quot;it is nice to hear a smoldering ballad of regret from one of the best vocalists in modern country music&quot;, although he added that he did not consider the song's theme original.\n\nGet Off on the Pain is the eighth studio album by American country music artist Gary Allan.

ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of those songs that you missed it with that girl, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the girl you always thought you should have (been) with and you let her slip through your fingers and now she is happy as hell and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think about you ever,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he joked with Jeff, to which the radio host responded, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve all got one of those girls in our past!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe Music Video for the single was filmed live during a performance from his Get Off on the Pain tour.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ee4752656ecde675cd4d244a13045a2d6255eb","amp;dn":"Gary+Allan+-+Today++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ee4752656ecde675cd4d244a13045a2d6255eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,238,71,82,101,110,205,230,117,205,77,36,74,19,4,90,45,98,85,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
