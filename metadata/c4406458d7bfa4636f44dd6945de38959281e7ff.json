Kosuke Matsuyama (Shun Shioya), is a second-year high school student. A nice, normal, nonviolent type, he suddenly finds himself in the middle of a rampaging crowd of Korean boys, outraged by insults perpetrated by several of his idiotic class-mates on two Korean girls. He makes a narrow escape, but soon after, he and his best bud Yoshio (Keisuke Koide) are sent by their home-room teacher to invite the Korean students to a friendly soccer game as a way of restoring the peace.\n\nTrembling like black-uniformed leaves, they enter enemy territory, where Kosuke encounters a doll-faced, but serious-looking girl (Erika Sawajiri) playing a Korean folk song, &quot;Imjin River,&quot; on a flute. He and Yoshio are also nearly lynched by her older brother Lee Ang Son (Sosuke Takaoka) and his gang, but he is already smitten -- and eager to learn that haunting tune.\n\nThe story concentrates on Kosuke's struggle to not only master a song, but win the love of a girl who seems to live in an alien, hostile world. Meanwhile, Ang Son and his crew are street-fighting with Japanese toughs as if playing a contact sport, with one side scoring hits, then the other. He is macho to a fault, but when he learns that his sweet-heart (Kyoko Yanagihara) is pregnant and determined to keep the baby, he faces a choice that makes him quail: grow up or cop out.\n\nGeneral:\n\nFormat.......: Matroska\nFile Size....: 1489,40 MiB\nDuration.....: 1h 59mn\nBitrate......: 1 750 Kbps\nSubtitles....: Custom English by Mazaliche/chochoc@ADC\nSource.......: DVD5 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4406458d7bfa4636f44dd6945de38959281e7ff","amp;dn":"Break+Through%21+%5BPacchigi%5D%5B2004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4406458d7bfa4636f44dd6945de38959281e7ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,64,100,88,215,191,164,99,111,68,221,105,69,222,56,149,146,129,231,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
