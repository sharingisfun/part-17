In this documentary, he presents a (bull?s) eye-opening account of the sport&amp;#039;s heady popularity in the 1970s and 1980s. He speaks to the fans and the players, including the Rabid Squirrels, the worst darts team in Britain.\n\nBack in the 1970s and 80s, darts was one of the biggest sports in the country. Every pub had its own dart board and mini league of players. The UK and World Darts championships attracted the kind of TV audience figures that are unheard of nowadays, attracting more than 18 million viewers. \n\nThe likes of Eric &quot;The Crafty Cockney&quot; Bristow, Jocky Wilson, John Lowe and Bobby George were household names. Even game shows got into the act, with Jim Bowen regularly enjoying a &amp;#039;bit of Bully&amp;#039; with an enraptured audience every Sunday evening on Bullseye.\n\n But then, the UK&amp;#039;s love affair with the oche and the arrow came to an end. In the space of a few short years, the whole idea of a Darts tournament being a major TV ratings hit would go from being perfectly normal to totally laughable. But why was this? Why did the British fall out of love with darts?\n\nIn Darts Tarts, writer and columnist Jacques Perretti sets out to discover what really happened to the game that fixated him as a child. He meets former players, obsessive fans, and people who have achieved the darts equivalent of a hole-in-one - the Nine Dart Finish. \n\nJacques also gets to meet the man who&amp;#039;s turned his garden shed into a Museum of Darts, and the Rabid Squirrels, said to be the worst darts team in the whole of Britain.\n\nFrÃƒÂ¥n UKNova.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:add186c87138dcc2e382c4d6bd80f1f777e7966f","amp;dn":"Darts+Tarts+-+Welcome+to+My+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"add186c87138dcc2e382c4d6bd80f1f777e7966f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,209,134,200,113,56,220,194,227,130,196,214,189,128,241,247,119,231,150,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
