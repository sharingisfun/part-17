The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.\n\nTrance and Acid - the theme that was played at the start of his sets for what seemed and eternity - and one that brought utter glee to the revelers on the dance floor. He is the powerhouse behind famous anthems like Too Many Times, Life is Too Short, 4 Just 1 Day and of course his breakthrough track Your Own Reality. Playing in the days where Techno ruled supreme, his style along with the likes of Warmduscher spawned a generation of DJ's and music being played now: hardstyle. Try to sit back, but have some dancefloor nearby as this will really make you want to move. Hard, but energetic and uplifting at the same time, Tracid is always a pleasure on the senses. Here is over 13 hours of the best.\n\nKai Tracid - Live @ Club Decolte - 20020524.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Einslive Partyservice - 20030119.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Qlimax - 20010600.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Rosenmontags Rave 20020211.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Rosenmontags Rave 20030303.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Soundtropolis Poland - 20060721.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Trance Energy 2003 Pre Party - 20030215.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Tunnel Hamburg - 20040229.mp3\nKai Tracid - Live @ Vision Park - 20020622.mp3\nKai Tracid Vs Asys - Live @ SSL Pick-Up - 20030121.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029d3ecb9af335d1a89a556e9eb0a4a5f4eabd02","amp;dn":"Gods+Collection+-+Kai+Tracid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029d3ecb9af335d1a89a556e9eb0a4a5f4eabd02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,157,62,203,154,243,53,209,168,154,85,110,158,176,164,165,244,234,189,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
