Numerous carefully crafted exercise sets accompanied by clear, crisp exposition give students a firm grasp of basic concepts and take the student from sentential logic through first-order predicate logic, the theory of descriptions, and identity. As the title suggests, this is a book devoted not merely to logic; students will encounter an abundance of philosophy as well. \n\n456 pages \nPublisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 11th edition (March 12, 2009) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:046116a13d21876bdc2011cd43aa8eb4446e25e3","amp;dn":"Logic+and+Philosophy%3A+A+Modern+Introduction+11th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"046116a13d21876bdc2011cd43aa8eb4446e25e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,97,22,161,61,33,135,107,220,32,17,205,67,170,142,180,68,110,37,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
