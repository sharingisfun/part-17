The sessions were rough going from the beginning. First, their manager, Peter Grant, withdrew from view after the death of Led Zeppelin drummer, John Bonham in 1980. That same year, the murder of John Lennon made the band change their way of thinking. Then, on another occasion, a fistfight broke out between Paul Rodgers and Boz Burrell, only to be restrained by Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirke.\n\nThe album's opening track, &quot;Electricland&quot;, written by Rodgers, was the album's biggest hit. Rodgers' &quot;Painted Face&quot; also received substantial airplay on rock stations.\n\nThe album became the original line-up's worst-selling album, reaching a disappointing No. 26 on the Billboard album charts in 1982.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Electricland&quot; (Paul Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:29\n    &quot;Untie the Knot&quot; (Rodgers; Simon Kirke) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n    &quot;Nuthin' on the TV&quot; (Boz Burrell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:46\n    &quot;Painted Face&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n    &quot;Kickdown&quot; (Mick Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:35\n    &quot;Ballad of the Band&quot; (Burrell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:10\n    &quot;Cross Country Boy&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:00\n    &quot;Old Mexico&quot; (Ralphs) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;Downhill Ryder&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:09\n    &quot;Racetrack&quot; (Rodgers) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n\n\n    Paul Rodgers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar\n    Mick RalphsÃ¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, slide guitar\n    Simon Kirke Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Boz Burrell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60c603d824156fbaed3900c6a4d268304a96c1cf","amp;dn":"Bad+Company+-+Rough+Diamonds+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60c603d824156fbaed3900c6a4d268304a96c1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,198,3,216,36,21,111,186,237,57,0,198,164,210,104,48,74,150,193,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
