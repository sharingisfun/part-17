For the last twenty-seven years of his life he was a schoolteacher and choir director whose duties extended to meal supervision and dormitory inspection. Yet throughout his career he composed a vast body of music which is amongst the most joyful, dancing and enrapturing ever written. This portrait-in-sound includes many examples of the music that made him immortal. With compelling narration by Jeremy Siepmann, character portrayals by acclaimed actors, and the interpolation of over twenty-five substantial musical extracts reflecting the development of one of musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most enduringly awe-inspiring composers, we are transported back three centuries straight into the life of Johann Sebastian Bach. This innovative sense of immediacy is at the heart of this comprehensive audio-biography, depicting the life of a composer whose music is universally admired. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027d999983fb872d236696661fada19f6cfc60a7","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Works+of+Johann+Sebastian+Bach+-+Jeremy+Siepmann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027d999983fb872d236696661fada19f6cfc60a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,125,153,153,131,251,135,45,35,102,150,102,31,173,161,159,108,252,96,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
