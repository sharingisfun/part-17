After lots of changes, the lineup finally found his stability on early 2008 with the entries of Davide Ã¢â‚¬Å“BrutalDaveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Billia (drums in Putridity) and Clod Ã¢â‚¬Å“The RipperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ De Rosa (Modus Delicti).\n\nThe band released 2 full length albums, Growing Seeds Of Decay (2006 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mutilated/Sevared rec.) and Erase the Insignificant (2009 - Permeated Records), which contributed to build a solid fan base and a strong reputation in the underground death metal scene; an intense live activity followed and brought SG playing in the main death metal events in Europe (Neurotic Deathfest, Mountains Of Death, Ludwigshafen Deathfest, Obscene Extreme) and even touring USA on summer 2010 with the ULR band Inherit Disease.\n\nThe band has recently signed a multi album contract with US label Brutal Bands (November 2010), and now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strongly motivated and ready to deliver his sickest and most focused material to date.\n\nTracklist:\n\nChapter I: Protogenesis\n1.
