But some chores are no work at all, like grooming young Jack. At eight months, his rough foal coat has shed out, leaving a smooth, rich silk, like chocolate. As for Black George, such a good horse, it turns out heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a natural jumper. When he and Abby clear four feet easy as pie, heads start to turn at the ringÃ¢â‚¬â€buyersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ headsÃ¢â‚¬â€and Abby knows Daddy wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t turn down a good offer. \n\nThen a letter arrives from a private investigator, and suddenly Abby stands to lose not one horse but two. The letter states that JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mare may have been sold to the Lovitts as stolen goods. A mystery unfolds, more surprising than Abby could ever expect. Will she lose her beloved Jack to his rightful owners?\n\nPulitzer Prize winner Jane Smiley raises horses of her own, and her affection and expertise shine through in this inviting horse novel for young readers, set in 1960s California horse country and featuring characters from The Georges and the Jewels.\n\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Animals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670ec6679c45a5bb3f3361c107fe55d36a51a36c","amp;dn":"A+Good+Horse+-+Jane+Smiley+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670ec6679c45a5bb3f3361c107fe55d36a51a36c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,14,198,103,156,69,165,187,63,51,97,193,7,254,85,211,106,81,163,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
