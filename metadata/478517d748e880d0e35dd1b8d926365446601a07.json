They had a run of hit singles during the 1980s and early 1990s, eventually scoring a total of 19 top-ten singles across the Billboard charts. Their greatest success was in the 1980s with the number-one album,  Sports, coupled with a series of highly successful MTV videos. Their worldwide fame expanded when the song The Power Of Love was featured as a key track in the film Back To The Future,  became a number-one hit, and nominated for an Academy Award. The News combined a rock (and sometimes, a &quot;blues-rock&quot;) backing with soul and doo-wop-influenced harmony vocals and Lewis' voice.\n[from Wikipedia]\n\n\n[b]Band Original Line-up:[/b]\n- Hugh Anthony Cregg, III  &quot;Huey Lewis&quot; (July 05,1950) - lead vocals,harmonica\n- Sean Thomas Hopper  (March 31,1953) - keyboards\n- William Scott &quot;Bill&quot; Gibson  (November 13,1951) - drums, percussion\n- John Victor &quot;Johnny&quot; Colla   (July 2, 1952) - guitars\n- Mario Cipollina (November 5, 1954) - bass (until 1995)\n\n[b]Links:[/b]\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.hln.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.hln.org/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscography:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Lewis_and_the_News_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_Lewis_and_the_News_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n- AVAILABLE DISCOGRAPHY FOR THIS COMPILATION:\n1980_Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n1982_Picture This\n1983_Sports\n1986_Fore\n1988_Small World\n1991_Hard At Play\n1992_The Heart Of Rock &amp; Roll_The Best\n1994 _Four Chords &amp; Several Years Ago\n2001_Plan B\n2010_Soulsville\n\n- COVER IMAGES\nThe original cover art (for the single/LP or CD) is included in the Info Tag of the mp3 file\n\n- LYRICS\nLyrics are included in the torrent (PDF file)\n\n-ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI would like to thank all the beautiful web sites from which I &quot;leeched&quot; all the information, images and lyrics.
