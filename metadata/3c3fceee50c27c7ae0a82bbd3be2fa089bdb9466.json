Beyond being worshiped for\nfertility, she .. was revered as the wise creator and the one source of universal\norder. Under her, women's roles differed markedly from those in patriarchal\nJudeo-Christian cultures. Women bought and sold property, traded in the\nmarketplace, and the inheritance of title and property was passed from\nmother to daughter.\n\nHow did the change come about? By documenting the wholesale rewriting\nof myth and religious dogmas, Merlin Stone details a most ancient conspiracy:\nthe patriarchal re-imaging of the Goddess as a wanton, depraved\nfigure. This is the portrait that laid the foundation for one of culture's greatest\nshams-'the legend of Adam and fallen Eve.\n\n&quot;The dramatic climax of her book is intriguing and important: that the\nmyth of Adam and Eve was designed as part of the continuous Levite battle\nto suppress a female religion!' -Martha Lifson, Los Angles Times\n\n&quot;Here i4' Jio~ful book that could well become required reading for .the\nwomen's move~ent ... a thoroughly fascinating study ..
