Creatures of the Deep.\nThe nature documentary series takes a look at marine invertebrates, some of the most bizarre and beautiful animals on the planet. Divers swim into a shoal of predatory Humboldt squid as the creatures emerge from the depths to hunt in packs. Time-lapse photography reveals thousands of starfish gathering under the Arctic ice to devour a seal carcass. And a giant octopus commits suicide for her young: a camera follows her into a cave which she walls up, then she protects her eggs until she starves.\n\nTechnical Specs for Hi-Def\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 1.80GB\nRipped by JungleBoy\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf22500e0c43ad2d24bef96dd694f0e8c94b568","amp;dn":"BBC+Life+08of10+Creatures+of+the+Deep+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf22500e0c43ad2d24bef96dd694f0e8c94b568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,242,37,0,224,196,58,210,210,75,239,150,221,105,79,14,140,148,181,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
