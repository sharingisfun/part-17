Now sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s working hard to bury the pieces left behindÃ¢â‚¬â€all but one. Her little sister, Livie. Kacey can swallow the constant disapproval from her born-again aunt Darla over her self-destructive lifestyle; she can stop herself from going kick-boxer crazy on Uncle Raymond when he loses the girlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ college funds at a blackjack table. She just needs to keep it together until Livie is no longer a minor, and then they can get the hell out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nBut when Uncle Raymond slides into bed next to Livie one night, Kacey decides itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to run. Armed with two bus tickets and dreams of living near the coast, Kacey and Livie start their new lives in a Miami apartment complex, complete with a grumpy landlord, a pervert upstairs, and a neighbor with a stage name perfectly matched to her chosen Ã¢â‚¬Å“profession.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But KaceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not worried. She can handle all of them. What she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle is Trent Emerson in apartment 1D.\n\nKacey doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to feel. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s safer that way. For everyone. But sexy Trent finds a way into her numb heart, reigniting her ability to love again. She starts to believe that maybe she can leave the past where it belongs and start over. Maybe sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not beyond repair.\n\nBut Kacey isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only one whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s broken. Seemingly perfect Trent has an unforgiveable past of his own; one that, when discovered, will shatter KaceyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newly constructed life and send her back into suffocating darkness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06b183cc6de6d5606b2d81c071197f7d2b218b8d","amp;dn":"Ten+Tiny+Breaths+-+K.A.+Tucker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06b183cc6de6d5606b2d81c071197f7d2b218b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,177,131,204,109,230,213,96,107,45,129,192,113,25,127,125,43,33,139,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
