Sam Bicke (Sean Penn) is a salesman for an office-supply company whose life is slowly beginning to unravel. Bicke's job is going nowhere, his wife, Marie (Naomi Watts), has left him, and his boss (Jack Thompson) keeps pushing self-help books on him that make a mockery of his state of mind. One of Bicke's few friends is Bonny Simmons (Don Cheadle), an auto mechanic, and together they come up with an idea for a tire shop on wheels; while neither has the money to finance the project, Bicke has learned of a program for small-business loans instituted by President Richard Nixon, which he's certain will come through for him. But Bicke is denied his loan, which dovetails with his increasing suspicion of the president's Vietnam policies and a sudden interest in the &quot;by any means necessary&quot; political activism of the Black Panther Party. Desperate to seem important in some way, Bicke becomes increasingly obsessed with the duplicity of Richard Nixon, until he chooses to take it upon himself to stop the president once and for all. The Assassination of Richard Nixon was the first feature film from director Niels Mueller.\n\nAlso known as: DÃƒÂ­as de furia, L'assassinat de Richard Nixon, Ãï¿½Ã‘â€šÃÂµÃÂ½Ã‘â€šÃÂ°Ã‘â€šÃ‘Å Ã‘â€š Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃ‘â€°Ã‘Æ’ ÃÂ ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€¡ÃÂ°Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ´ Ãï¿½ÃÂ¸ÃÂºÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘Å ÃÂ½, O Assassinato de um Presidente, Attentat auf Richard Nixon, Attentat pÃƒÂ¥ Nixon, El asesinato de Richard Nixon, Richard Nixonin salamurha, I dolofonia tou Richard Nixon, A Richard Nixon-merÃƒÂ©nylet, The Assassination, Zabic prezydenta, O AssassÃƒÂ­nio de Richard Nixon, Ubistvo RiÃ„ï¿½arda Niksona, ÃÂ£ÃÂ±ÃÂ¸Ã‘â€šÃ‘Å’ ÃÂ¿Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂµÃÂ·ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ÃÂµÃÂ½Ã‘â€šÃÂ°.
