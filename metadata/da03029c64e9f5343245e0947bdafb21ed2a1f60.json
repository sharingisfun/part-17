In six years he hasn&amp;#039;t thrown a punch. He hasn&amp;#039;t held, much less fired, a gun. He hasn&amp;#039;t called his friend Win, still the scariest man he knows, to back him up or get him out of trouble.\n\n  All that is about to change...because of a promise.\n\n  The school year is almost over. In these last pressure-cooker months of high school, some kids will make the all-too-common and all-too-dangerous mistake of drinking and driving. But Myron is determined to help keep his friends&amp;#039; children safe, so he makes two neighborhood girls promise him: If they ever in a bind but are afraid to call their parents, they must call him.\n\n  Several nights later, the call comes at 2:00 AM, and true to his word, Myron picks up one of the girls in midtown Manhattan and drives her to a quiet cul-de-sac in New Jersey where she says her friend lives.\n\n  The next day, the girl&amp;#039;s parents discover that their daughter is missing, and that Myron was the last person to see her. Desperate to fulfill a well-intentioned promise turned nightmarishly wrong. Myron races to find her before she&amp;#039;s gone forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da03029c64e9f5343245e0947bdafb21ed2a1f60","amp;dn":"Harlan+Coben+-+Promise+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da03029c64e9f5343245e0947bdafb21ed2a1f60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,3,2,156,100,233,245,52,50,69,224,148,123,218,251,33,237,42,31,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
