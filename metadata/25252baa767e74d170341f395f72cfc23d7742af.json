Yet he places every battle in a wide perspective, revealing their significance to America's development as it grew from a new Republic on the edge of a threatening frontier to a global superpower.\nDecision at Sea is a powerful and illuminating look at pivotal moments in the history of the Navy and of the United States. It is also a compelling study of the unchanging demands of leadership at sea, where commanders must make rapid decisions in the heat of battle with lives--and the fate of nations--hanging in the balance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25252baa767e74d170341f395f72cfc23d7742af","amp;dn":"Decision+at+Sea+by+Craig+L.+Symonds+%28420weedman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25252baa767e74d170341f395f72cfc23d7742af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,37,43,170,118,126,116,209,112,52,31,57,95,114,207,194,61,119,66,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
