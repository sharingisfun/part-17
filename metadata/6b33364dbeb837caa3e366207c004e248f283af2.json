It ends, 100 pages later, in the year 2000, with the death rattle of a 100-year-old man. The infant and the old man are both Julio, and Gilbert Hernandez's Julio's Day (originally serialized in Love and Rockets Vol. II but never completed until now) is his latest graphic novel, a masterpiece of elliptical, emotional storytelling that traces one life - indeed, one century in a human life - through a series of carefully crafted, consistently surprising and enthralling vignettes.\n\nThere is hope and joy, there is bullying and grief, there is war (so much war - this is after all the 20th century), there is love, there is heartbreak. While Julio's Day has some settings and elements in common with Hernandez's Palomar cycle (the Central American protagonists and milieu, the vivid characters, the strong familial and social ties), this is a very much a singular, standalone story that will help cement his position as one of the strongest and most original cartoonists of this, or any other, century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b33364dbeb837caa3e366207c004e248f283af2","amp;dn":"Gilbert+Hernandez+-+Julio%27s+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b33364dbeb837caa3e366207c004e248f283af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,51,54,77,190,184,55,202,163,227,102,32,124,0,78,36,143,40,58,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
