One major focus of the book is extension phenomena alien to the one-dimensional theory (Hartog's Kugelsatz, theorem of Cartan-Thullen, Bochner's theorem). The book primarily aims at students starting to work in the field of complex analysis in several variables and teachers who want to prepare a university lecture. Therefore, the book contains more than 50 examples and more than 100 supporting exercises.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 172 pages\nPublisher: BirkhÃƒÂ¤user; 2005 edition (September 16, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 376437490X\nISBN-13: 978-3764374907\n\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720595e8bba022a6d217c44d7ee31ceb06ce3b6a","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Complex+Analysis+in+Several+Variables+by+Volker+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720595e8bba022a6d217c44d7ee31ceb06ce3b6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,5,149,232,187,160,34,166,210,23,196,77,126,227,28,235,6,206,59,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
