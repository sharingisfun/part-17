His small act of kindness propels him into a world he never dreamed existed. There are people who fall through the cracks, and Richard has become one of them. And he must learn to survive in this city of shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, murderers and angels, if he is ever to return to the London that he knew.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a53fec4607d2db542c2411d914b310e438bd79","amp;dn":"Neverwhere+-+Neil+Gaiman+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a53fec4607d2db542c2411d914b310e438bd79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,165,63,236,70,7,210,219,84,44,36,17,217,20,179,16,228,56,189,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
