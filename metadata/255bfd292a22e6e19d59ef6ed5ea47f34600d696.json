After downloading, use Daemon Tools Lite or PowerISO to mount the image to a virtual drive.\n\n2. Run setup.exe, or use the autorun feature when clicking on the icon in Computer. The setup will switch the color scheme to basic. It works on Vista 32-bit without running compatibility mode. If it doesn't work, right click setup.exe and click properties. Go to the compatibility tab and check the box to run in compatibilty mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 2). Also, try running as administrator.\n\n3. The serial code is 108956-515663-985633-6869\n\n3. The game must stay mounted to play it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255bfd292a22e6e19d59ef6ed5ea47f34600d696","amp;dn":"The+Sims+%5BOriginal%3B+No+Expansions%3B+CD+Rip%3B+ISO%3B+PC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255bfd292a22e6e19d59ef6ed5ea47f34600d696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,91,253,41,42,34,230,225,157,89,239,110,213,234,71,243,70,0,214,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
