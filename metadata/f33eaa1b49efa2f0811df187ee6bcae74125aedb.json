It contains the full version of the song &quot;Hobbit&quot; which I believe is deleted from the 1 disc versions of this album.\n\nI googled high and low and could not find any reference to this release which is one of the few complete versions available. \n\nALvin Lee on guitar, 'nuff said.\n\n\nRecorded Live is a live album by British blues rock musicians Ten Years After, which was released as a double LP in 1973.\n\n--This album is a truthful recording of Ten Years After with no overdubs or additives. What you --hear is what happened on the night. Recorded over four nights in Amsterdamm, Rotterdam, --Frankfurt and Paris with the Rolling Stones' mobile recording truck and later mixed from --sixteen track to stereo at Olympic Studios in London.\n\n-In answer to the inferior live recordings sold illegally: this is the true Ten Years After bootleg. The omission of &quot;Hobbit&quot; for the first USA release was a big mistake. Not only are you missing Ric Lee's bombastic drum solo, but also Alvin's smokin' tone to kick off the drum solo from &quot;Big Red&quot;, his 1958 Gibson ES-335 wired through enough Marshall stacks to blow the house down. The omission is like Led Zepplin II without &quot;Moby Dick&quot; on it!\n\nDutch live compilation for the British blues-rock act feat.guitar virtuoso Alvin Lee. Tracks include, 'You Give Me Loving', 'Help Me', 'I'm Going Home' and many more. \n2000 release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f33eaa1b49efa2f0811df187ee6bcae74125aedb","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+Recorded+Live+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f33eaa1b49efa2f0811df187ee6bcae74125aedb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,62,170,27,73,239,162,240,129,29,241,135,238,107,202,231,65,37,174,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
