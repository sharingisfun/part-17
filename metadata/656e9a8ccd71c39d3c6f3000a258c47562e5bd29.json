But these songs are so dang catchy that sometimes I just don't care.\n\n\n1 In Ohio  0:46 \n2 Can't Exist  4:08 \n3 Stumble and Pain  4:43 \n4 Devil's Broom  4:46 \n5 Echo Park  2:51 \n6 Even Tho  4:47 \n7 Puppets  3:53 \n8 Wasted  4:13 \n9 Failed  4:22 \n10 I Am  4:14 \n11 A Smile That Explodes  3:21 \n12 Leave Us Alone  3:47 \n\nSo, pretty good if unspectacular stuff all the way through after &quot;Can't Exist.&quot; That track is worth the purchase alone.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656e9a8ccd71c39d3c6f3000a258c47562e5bd29","amp;dn":"Joseph+Arthur...Our+Shadows+Will+Remain%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656e9a8ccd71c39d3c6f3000a258c47562e5bd29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,110,154,140,205,113,195,157,60,111,48,0,162,88,196,117,98,229,189,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
