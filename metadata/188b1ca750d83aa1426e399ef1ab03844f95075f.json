The first of these three CDs is the strongest, highlighted by &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (featuring altoist Johnny Hodges), &quot;I'm Confessin'&quot; with trumpeter Jonah Jones, and the four master takes from a date with Coleman Hawkins, Chu Berry, Ben Webster, Benny Carter and a young Dizzy Gillespie. Great music but dumb programming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188b1ca750d83aa1426e399ef1ab03844f95075f","amp;dn":"Lionel+Hampton+-+Hot+Mallets%2C+Volume+1+%281987%29+%5BFLAC+EAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188b1ca750d83aa1426e399ef1ab03844f95075f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,139,28,167,80,216,58,161,66,110,57,158,241,171,3,132,79,149,7,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
