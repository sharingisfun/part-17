It is possible to create complicated scenes with a huge amount of objects easy and quickly with the aid of this plug-in.\n\nUsually scenes in 3ds max with a great amount of even identical objects take a lot of space on HDD, consumes a lot of time for loading, and it is very hard to work with. MultiScatter is created to solve these problems. The scene containing 500 000 identical objects created with 3ds max 2008 occupies 1400Mb of HDD space. Now, if it is created with MultiScatter and still containing the same 500 000 objects the scene can take just 250Kb.\n\nThe most exciting feature of MultiScatter is a quick generation of an array of objects right before rendering. Those very 500 000 objects are created in only 2 seconds before rendering. Another outstanding MultiScatter ability is uploading and downloading from VRayProxy memory if needed (as and when necessary). This allows the application of polygon models without missing productivity and capacity of RAM.\n\nAnimated objects support and animated VRayProxy support allows creating huge amounts of animated objects. Now with MultiScatter it is possible to create the whole forest of wind-shaken woods.\n\nThe support of 64-bit systems and multi core processing allows MultiScatter to create and render, for example, forest or even a city in a blink of an eye.\n\nMultiScatter includes integrated procedure map/card - MultiScatterTexture. This card helps to create uncountable amount of various tones to gain a more realistic appearance of the scenes with huge number of similar objects. There can be, for example, different tones of leaves in a forest or various colours of cars at the parking area. MultiScatterTexture is able also to define different tones for the mixing materials, cards, etc.\n\nMultiScatterTexture may be applied both to the MultiScatter objects and to any other objects at the scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1bdf0a094fa1f3c3b1e886969f15cd5b9590260","amp;dn":"MultiScatter.1.0.18a.3Ds.Max.2008-2011.x64.x86","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1bdf0a094fa1f3c3b1e886969f15cd5b9590260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,189,240,160,148,250,31,60,59,30,136,105,105,241,92,213,185,89,2,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
