[Mohandas] is meticulously researched, written in felicitous prose and is a delight to readÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€Khushwant Singh, Outlook\n\nA candid recreation of one of the most influential lives of recent times, Mohandas finally answers questions long asked about the timid youth from PBI - IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s west coast who became a centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conscience and led his nation to liberty: What was Gandhi like in his daily life and in his closest relationships? In his face-offs with an Empire, with his own bitterly divided people, with his adversaries, his family andÃ¢â‚¬â€his greatest confrontationÃ¢â‚¬â€with himself?\n\nAnswering these and other questions, and releasing the true Gandhi from his shroud of fame and myth, Mohandas, authored by a practised biographer who is also GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandson, does more than tell a story.\n\nPraise for the Book\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœRajmohan strikes a fine balance in this comprehensive work, lacing the painstakingly detailed chronological account with just the right amount of interpretation. [His] approach goes a long way in painting a portrait of Gandhiji that is very human, plausible, and easy to identify withÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€Mukund Padmanabhan, The Hindu\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœAn impeccable exercise in objectivity . . . A remarkable performance. This biography ought to be read over and over again . . . The bareness of RajmohanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recital of moods and events heightens the poignancy . . . Mahatma Gandhi was a votary of restraint; this book exemplifies, magnificently, such restraint. The grandfather would have approved of RajmohanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MohandasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€Ashok Mitra, Telegraph\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœA story of epic proportions . . . GandhiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luminous compassion, courage and humanity shine through these pages and bring light into our livesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€Sonia Gandhi\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœThe only word to describe this work is Ã¢â‚¬Å“fabulousÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Literally scores of people have written on Mahatma Gandhi . . . But . . . Mohandas will henceforth be remembered as the last word on the subjectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€M.V.
