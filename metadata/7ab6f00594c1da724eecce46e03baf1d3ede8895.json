If you're looking for the New Wave side of the equation I would suggest Le Beau Serge, Les Cousins &amp; Les Bonnes Femmes. All three early 60's New Wave masterpieces. By the late 60's however Chabrol was a different kind of film maker. This Man Must Die along with La Femme Infidele &amp; Le Boucher are what might be considered the best films from Chabrol's second phase. Until his resurgence in the 90's with the Cesar winning La Ceremonie these three second phase films were also considered his last great films. La Femme Infidele, Le Boucher &amp; This Man Must Die(under its French title Que la Bete Muere) have not been the easiest films to find but have now all been rereleased in March 2003. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064861/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064861/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab6f00594c1da724eecce46e03baf1d3ede8895","amp;dn":"Que.La.Bete.Meure.1969.DVDRip.DivX5.MKO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab6f00594c1da724eecce46e03baf1d3ede8895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,182,240,5,148,193,218,114,78,236,206,70,224,59,175,29,62,222,136,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
