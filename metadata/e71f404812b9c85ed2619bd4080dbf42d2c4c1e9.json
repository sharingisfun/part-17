For here is a collection of all his most notable works.\n\nJ C Bach was very well regarded in his lifetime and is known to posterity as the 'London Bach' due to the fact that like Handel he chose to live in England. Indeed, the boy Mozart became good friends with him during his boyhood stay in the country.\n\nThe music has much charm to it and you can see the influence which he bore on the young Mozart very clearly.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e71f404812b9c85ed2619bd4080dbf42d2c4c1e9","amp;dn":"Johann+Christian+Bach+-+The+Collector%5C%27s+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e71f404812b9c85ed2619bd4080dbf42d2c4c1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,31,64,72,18,185,200,94,210,97,155,212,8,13,191,66,210,196,193,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
