Nate Ruess, late of The Format, has teamed up with ex-Anathallo multi-instrumentalist Andrew Dost and Steel TrainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jack Antonoff, resulting in their ingenious debut, Aim And Ignite. The trio melds a stunning array of diverse inspirations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ spanning Broadway to The Beach Boys, Nilsson Shmilsson to Pinkerton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ into an irresistible collection of freewheeling Pop songcraft. Fun have crafted something special indeed, a contemporary rethinking of classic Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s pop, where ornate arrangements and inspired orchestrations meet present-day Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1 Be Calm\n2 Benson Hedges\n3 All the Pretty Girls\n4 I Wanna Be the One\n5 At Least IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not As Sad (As I Used to Be)\n6 Light a Roman Candle With Me\n7 Walking the Dog\n8 Barlights\n9 The Gambler\n10 Take Your Time (Coming Home)\n11 Stitch Me Up\n12 Walking the Dog II\n13 Take Your Time (Acoustic Version)\n14 Walking the Dog (RAC Mix)\n15 All the Pretty Girls (RAC Mix)\n16 All the Pretty Girls [Video]\n17 Walking the Dog [Video]\n\n+ Digital Booklet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Aim and Ignite [Deluxe Video Version]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e38272c6a52c4c6dd4e1717b53068d4b9cecb5bb","amp;dn":"Fun++Aim+and+Ignite+%28iTunes+Deluxe+Video+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e38272c6a52c4c6dd4e1717b53068d4b9cecb5bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,130,114,198,165,44,76,109,212,225,113,123,83,6,141,75,156,236,181,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
