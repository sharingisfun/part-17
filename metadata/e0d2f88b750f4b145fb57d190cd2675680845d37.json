Will only work with version 5.01b\n\n\nJust copy the comdlgxp.dll and the CommonVcPh.dll to\nyour Wavelab folder. Overwrite existing files.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nMore info for those interested...\n-----------------------------------\nLike many others, I was frustrated when I found out that\nWavelab 5 did not run on Vista. Even more frustrated when\nSteinberg said that they would not fix the problem for version 5.\nInstead, one had to buy the new version 6. Yeah right!\n\nWell good news! I happen to be good at reverse engineering and\nI have a solution for you all. I was very curious on finding why\nin hell Wavelab crashed when trying to &quot;Open&quot; or to &quot;Save As...&quot;\na file. Well, it looks like the problem comes from some changes in\nthe comdlg32.dll in Vista. Some wavelab variable gets overwritten\nby the GetOpenFilename function inside comdlg32.dll. That causes\nthe application to crash. By debugging the disassembled code, I was\nable to realize that Steinberg could have easily fixed the bug. They only \nhad to make a minor change in the source code. They wont fix it because\nthey want to make more money off you! \n\n\n\nBy The Black Numenorean","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d2f88b750f4b145fb57d190cd2675680845d37","amp;dn":"Wavelab+5.01b+FIX+for+VISTA+%28just+the+fix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d2f88b750f4b145fb57d190cd2675680845d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,210,248,139,117,15,75,20,95,181,125,25,12,210,103,86,128,132,93,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
