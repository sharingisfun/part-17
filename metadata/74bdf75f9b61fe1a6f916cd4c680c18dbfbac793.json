ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like buying one theme and constantly getting access to new themes all the time! \n\nThe Stacks currently included in X are as follows (the links below take you to the main demo for each Stack; however, we have created multiple unique demos for each Stack so be sure to check them all out via the links in the navigation):\n\nExperts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ X was built upon the input of industry-leading experts. We consulted numerous individuals and asked them what sort of features they wanted to see in a theme from an SEO standpoint, design, feature-set, et cetera, and built their suggestions right into the theme. Forget the marketing speak, X truly delivers on what it promises.\n\nCustomizer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Being on the cutting edge of WordPress development is something we wanted to do from the start. Because of that, we made sure that we avoided the use of clunky additional admin panels and instead, opted to utilize the native WordPress Customizer (or rather, our souped up version of the WordPress Customizer). \n\nWith this setup, you can preview all of the changes you make to your site live without any need to switch windows or refresh the browser over and over again. When youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re happy with your changes, select Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save &amp; PublishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and your updates will go live.\n\nIf you like it, please support the creators and buy it!
