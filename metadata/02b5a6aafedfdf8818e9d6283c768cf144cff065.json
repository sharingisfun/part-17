I would give many of the recordings from which these songs are drawn four stars, but sometimes this would be because of the overshadowing strength of one or two songs.  This recording takes the best without the rest.  There is not a clunker on it.  It ranges from the delightfully upbeat showmanship of &quot;Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, complete with the syncopated vocals of Gillespie (it's the only vocal on the recording and you will find yourself singing it), to more delicate companionship with Oscar Peterson and his trio.  By contrast, &quot;Moten Swing&quot; off the original recording with Peterson sounds so hackneyed to me that I just cannot listen to it.  \nNone of the songs date from Stitt's funk period, which is a style of his that has not worn as well over the years.  These are pieces that sparkle even amidst the talented field of works from the high era of acoustic jazz.  The sound quality of the recordings is also good enough to not be a detraction, as is not the case with many recordings of this period.  ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nSonny Stitt's phrases are like cool steel.  He has a sense of humor and does his own thang.  The Bird comparisons are invalid, because he is said to have been playing the bebop alto since the late 40's.  On this CD, we get a view of late 50's/early 60's Sonny.  He shines alongside Gene Ammons on &quot;Walkin'&quot;, a solid mid-paced burner and the lovely &quot;Time&quot; with strings.  If you never hear his playing, you will miss out on one of America's greatest jazz musicians.  ~ Ahmed Chronwell\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 50 - Sonny Stitt Tracks:\n01  I Got Rhythm 3:09\n02  Mean To Me 6:35\n03  Sonny's Tune 5:33\n04  Time After Time 3:50\n05  Walkin' 5:24\n06  Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me 5:14\n07  Easy Does It 5:25\n08  Just Friends 3:51\n09  Easy Living 4:50\n10  On The Sunny Side Of The Street 5:43\n11  Laura 4:52\n12  The String 9:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02b5a6aafedfdf8818e9d6283c768cf144cff065","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+50+-+Sonny+Stitt+%281995%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160-320%5D%5Bh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02b5a6aafedfdf8818e9d6283c768cf144cff065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,181,166,170,254,223,223,136,24,233,214,40,60,118,140,241,68,207,240,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
