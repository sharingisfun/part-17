Their first single, &quot;Every Beat Of My Heart,&quot; was written by Otis for another Paradise discovery, Jackie Wilson, but the Royals' version, inspired by the smooth sound of Sonny Til and the Orioles, went nowhere. To make matters worse, original member Lawson Smith was about to depart for the Army.\nHis replacement was Hank Ballard, who'd run away from his Alabama home to return to his birthplace, a singer who'd also played the Paradise but couldn't get signed in an era of groups. Throwing in with the Royals, he urged them in a earthier direction with an original he'd written, &quot;Get It.&quot; Ralph Bass of Federal suggested their next hit feature the phrase &quot;work with me,&quot; and &quot;Work With Me Annie&quot; was born. It would become the first R&amp;B hit to cross over to white teens. In fact, the song was so popular it caused the band to become the Midnighters overnight so as to avoid confusion with doo-woppers the 5 Royales.\nAfter several &quot;Annie&quot; followups, the Midnighters hit next, ironically, with the ballad &quot;Teardrops On Your Letter.&quot; But it was the flip side that really got DJ Dick Clark's attention: when he submitted &quot;The Twist&quot; to friend Chubby Checker to record, the result kicked off a national dance craze feeding frenzy. The hits stopped coming by the mid-Sixties, but Ballard continued working, thanks largely to fan James Brown; in the years before his death, he was known to take new versions of the Midnighters out on the road to enthusiastic audiences. Ballard died of throat cancer in 2003. \n\nTracklist:\n\n1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Twist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rock &amp; Roll Wedding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Midnighters\n3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Henry's Got Flat Feet (Can't Dance No More) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Midnighters\n4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ E Basta Cosi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Midnighters\n5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rock, Granny, Roll ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Midnighters\n6 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Coffee Grind ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n7 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Finger Poppin' Time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n8 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n9 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hoochie Coochie Coo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Continental Walk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Let's Go Again (Where We Went Last Night) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Float ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Switch-A-Roo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Keep on Dancing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It's Twistin' Time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n16 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Good Twistin' Tonight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n17 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Do You Know How to Twist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard &amp; the Midnighters\n18 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That Low Down Move ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n19 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (I'm Going Back to) The House on the Hill ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n20 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Poppin' the Whip ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n21 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sloop and Slide ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n22 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dance Till It Hurtcha ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n23 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Funny Soul Train ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n24 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Butter YourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hank Ballard\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a487b1ed8f38c7df171f15b3b125ad2ed6b18a5f","amp;dn":"Hank+Ballard+and+The+Midnighters+-+Dancin%5C%27+And+Twistin%5C%27%28rock%29%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a487b1ed8f38c7df171f15b3b125ad2ed6b18a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,135,177,237,143,56,199,223,23,31,21,179,177,37,173,46,214,177,138,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
