Despite their beginnings as a post-hardcore band bordering on pop-punk territory, the New York based rock quartet has grown to incorporate elements of classic rock, prog, and metal to formulate a sound all their own while appealing to a wide and diverse audience Ã¢â‚¬â€ something thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to accomplish these days in mainstream rock. The band was thought to have hit their peak in the breakout hit record Good Apollo, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Burning Star IV: From Fear Through The Eyes Of Madness and then appeared to have been running out of good ideas just two albums later in Year of the Black Rainbow, but with their new double album origin story for their discography-wide conceptual universe The Amory Wars in The Afterman, the band have showed no signs of slowing down as they release their greatest material to date.\nTelling the story of astronaut Sirius Amory, who discovers the secrets behind the cosmic energy source The Keywork, The Afterman: Descension picks up where the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sonic cliffhangerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (as frontman Claudio Sanchez calls it) leaves off in The Afterman: Ascension; Sirius is on the brink of losing his life after being possessed and forced to relive the lives of the entities living in The Keywork. As Ascension painted the astronautÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ascent into space and scientific achievement, Descension not only follows his life as he returns to his home planet, but the emotional depths he reaches as he deals with guilt and remorse for losing the love of his life.\nWhile the story is hard to follow without the companion coffee table book and given the musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at-times seemingly incongruous nature against the storyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s events, Coheed and CambriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s penchant for storytelling though music is further cemented and ever more stirring on Descension. This record contains some of CoheedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most emotive work to date, with the one-two downer of somber and reflective Ã¢â‚¬ËœIron FistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the hauntingly beautiful ballad Ã¢â‚¬ËœDark Side Of MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ putting an emotional weight on the audience before the silver-linings catharsis of Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2Ã¢â‚¬Â²s My Favorite 1Ã¢â‚¬Â² ends The Afterman with some much needed closure. Despite the dark themes exploring the death of a loved one and introspective turmoil, the album ends on a high note not only for the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protagonist, but for Coheed and Cambria as artists.\nWhile it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as strong as a cohesive album as its predecessor, Descension does house some of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strongest work to date. The band have always successfully bridged progressive rock and pop, which is hard to accomplish while holding onto both artistic integrity and sincerity, but the band have started to explore new ideas within this disparate cross-section of influences. Following the two back to back potential classic hard rock anthems in the acoustic and Latin-infused Ã¢â‚¬ËœSentry The DefiantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the funky Pink Floydian Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Hard SellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with the strangely Wham!-invoking Ã¢â‚¬ËœNumber CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ would be a head-scratcher for lesser bands, but the sheer talent and confidence put on display across not only Descension but for the entire The Afterman double album puts Coheed and Cambria among the likes of Faith No More and Devin Townsend in their ability to get away with anything.\nThe Afterman is undoubtedly Coheed and CambriaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crowning achievement thus far in their careers. The admittedly excessive praise reflected in this review may be off-putting to those who only know the band based on their hits, but accessibility and the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tight grasp on writing catchy tunes is only one aspect to CoheedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multi-faceted success in the realm of rock music. High concept, unparallelled songwriting, and forward-thinking musicianship lies within this double album, and if it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t considered a rock and roll classic, there is no justice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e790b7f4925620855203ea60da46a44809c8f3e","amp;dn":"Coheed+and+Cambria+-+The+Afterman+Descension+%282013%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e790b7f4925620855203ea60da46a44809c8f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,121,11,127,73,37,98,8,85,32,62,166,13,164,106,68,128,156,143,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
