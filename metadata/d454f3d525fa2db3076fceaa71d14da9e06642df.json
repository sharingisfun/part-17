The characteristic deep red color of the ripe tomato fruit and related products is mainly due to lycopene. Lycopene is the predominant carotenoid in tomatoes, followed by a-carotene, b-carotene, g-carotene, and phytoene, as well as by several other minor carotenoids. Tomatoes and tomato-based foods have long been an important source of lycopene in the Western diet.\n\nThere has been a growing interest in exploring the role of lycopene in the prevention of a variety of nutritional and health issues in humans, including some cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, many case studies using cell cultures, animal models, and epidemiological investigations have shown a relationship between lycopene intake and a lowered risk of contracting some cancers and various chronic diseases. Increasingly, clinical evidence supports the role of lycopene as a nutrient with important health benefits, since it appears to provide protection against a broad range of epithelial cancers. The possibility that consumption of lycopene-rich foods may reduce the risk of such diseases has prompted numerous in-depth studies of the levels of lycopene in foods and of correlations between dietary lycopene and certain diseases. This monograph will serve as a reference for providing a better understanding of the role of lycopene in promoting health, and by encouraging a deeper understanding of approaches to a healthy diet and life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d454f3d525fa2db3076fceaa71d14da9e06642df","amp;dn":"Lycopene%3A+Nutritional%2C+Medicinal+and+Therapeutic+Properties","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d454f3d525fa2db3076fceaa71d14da9e06642df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,84,243,213,37,250,45,179,7,111,206,170,113,209,77,169,224,102,66,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
