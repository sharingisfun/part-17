The script was written by Richardson with Pete Richens, derived from elements of an earlier screenplay for a three part mini-series satirising the Catholic Church, which was rejected by Channel 4. The Pope Must Die stars Robbie Coltrane as a low ranking priest who is mistakenly elected Pope, then has to avoid being assassinated by the Mafia. The film co-stars Adrian Edmondson, Annette Crosbie, Herbert Lom, Alex Rocco and Richardson. The production was filmed in 1990 in what was then Yugoslavia on a budget of Ã‚Â£2.5 million. The film's subject was controversial and the distributors experienced serious difficulties with its promotion, London Transport refusing to carry advertising for it until the film's posters were censored. In the USA the Big Three television networks refused to show commercials for the film, which they said was sacrilegious and offensive. Many newspapers in the US also censored or refused to carry advertising for the film. The film was released to mixed reviews, and struggled at the box office, failing to make back its budget at the cinema.\n\nPlot: \n\nThe plot is predicated on the Vatican being controlled by the Mafia. The movie opens with the death of the previous Pope and the Mob's tame Cardinal (Alex Rocco) successfully persuading the College of Cardinals to elect the Mafia's favoured candidate to the papacy, Albini.\n\nUnfortunately, the secretary of the College of Cardinals (Adrian Edmondson) is hard of hearing, and announces the similar name of an honest parish priest, Albinizi, (Robbie Coltrane) who thus becomes Pope. As the plot develops, the Pope demands to see the Vatican accounts and discovers the gun-smuggling and stolen merchandise operations, and confronts the Mob, who decide that the Pope must die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbaf8ec9908a6f12437dd3fcf15ba03eaa8fe029","amp;dn":"The+Pope+Must+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbaf8ec9908a6f12437dd3fcf15ba03eaa8fe029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,175,142,201,144,138,111,18,67,125,211,252,241,91,160,62,170,143,224,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
