Some are more credible than others, and, frankly, some are completely insane, but all are observed with appropriate seriousness as Taylor attempts to better understand some of the spooky things that have happened to him in his life, especially that night at the Cold House.\n\nBut thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not all, folks. Taylor once again gives you a behind-the-scenes tour of his crazy life and the many beyond-the-grave events heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encountered. (YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be shocked how often Slipknot has been invaded by the supernatural.) Taylor also touches on his religious background and how it led him to believe in much more than the Man in the Sky.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9be9c40c05e1c85e55c06fb9ecdbf7f2a0148a76","amp;dn":"A+Funny+Thing+Happened+On+The++Heaven+-+Corey+Taylor.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9be9c40c05e1c85e55c06fb9ecdbf7f2a0148a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,233,196,12,5,225,200,94,85,192,111,185,236,219,247,242,160,20,138,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
