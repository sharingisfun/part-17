A co-production of Marvel Productions and TSR, the show was popular in the United States and ran for three seasons on CBS. The show's story editors were Hank Saroyan and Steve Gerber, who both contributed episodes and had a firm hand in the writing of the series.\n\nThe general premise of the show is that a group of children are pulled into the &quot;Realm of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; by taking a magical dark ride trip on an amusement park roller coaster. Invariably, the children wish most to return home, but often take detours to help people, or find that their fates are intertwined with the fate of others.\n\nAfter arriving in the Realm, the children are a little out of place, but the Dungeon Master, named for the role of the referee in the role-playing game, appears assuming the role of their mentor, and gives them each clothing and magical paraphernalia to suit their abilities.\n\n\n\nThe main characters of the show are six friends, ranging from age 8 to 15, trying to find their way home. They are:\n\nProtagonists\n\nHank, the Ranger (Willie Aames)\n\nEric, the Cavalier (Don Most)\n\nDiana, the Acrobat (Tonya Gail Smith)\n\nPresto, the Magician (Adam Rich)\n\nBobby, the Barbarian (Ted Field III)\n\nUni, the Unicorn (Frank Welker)\n\nDungeon Master (Sidney Miller)\n\n\n\nAntagonists\n\nVenger, Force of Evil (Peter Cullen)\n\nShadow Demon (Bob Holt)\n\nTiamat (Frank Welker)\n\n\n\nSeason 1: (1983)\nSeason 2: (1984)\nSeason 3: (1985)\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01 &quot;The Night of No Tomorrow&quot; \n02 &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; \n03 &quot;The Hall of Bones&quot; \n04 &quot;Valley of the Unicorns&quot; \n05 &quot;In Search of the Dungeon Master&quot; \n06 &quot;Beauty and the Bogbeast&quot; \n07 &quot;Prison Without Walls&quot; \n\nDisc 2\n\n08 &quot;Servant of Evil&quot; \n09 &quot;Quest of the Skeleton Warrior&quot; \n10 &quot;The Garden of Zinn&quot; \n11 &quot;The Box&quot; \n12 &quot;The Lost Children&quot; \n13 &quot;P-R-E-S-T-O Spells Disaster&quot; \n14 &quot;The Girl Who Dreamed Tomorrow&quot; \n\nDisc 3\n\n15 &quot;The Treasure of Tardos&quot; \n16 &quot;City at the Edge of Midnight&quot; \n17 &quot;The Traitor&quot; \n18 &quot;Day of the Dungeon Master&quot; \n19 &quot;The Last Illusion&quot; \n20 &quot;The Dragon's Graveyard&quot; \n21 &quot;Child of the Stargazer&quot; \n\nDisc 4 \n\n\n22 &quot;The Dungeon at the Heart of Dawn&quot; \n23 &quot;The Time Lost&quot; \n24 &quot;Odyssey of the Twelfth Talisman&quot; \n25 &quot;Citadel of Shadow&quot; \n26 &quot;Cave of the Fairie Dragons&quot; \n27 &quot;The Winds of Darkness&quot; \n\n                        [Special Features Included On All Discs]\n\nLanguage: English\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 \nRunTime: 573min\nPAL\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:684a97e963c1ee2df89f6f2acbd7189a2d0e346c","amp;dn":"Dungeons+%26+Dragons+%5BComplete%5D+%281983-1985%29++DVD-R++PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"684a97e963c1ee2df89f6f2acbd7189a2d0e346c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,74,151,233,99,193,238,45,248,159,111,42,203,215,24,154,45,14,52,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
