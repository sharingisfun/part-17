In addition to the relationship between physical and mathematical spaces, it examines the interactions of geometry, algebra, and calculus. The text proves many significant theorems and employs several important techniques. Chapters on non-Euclidean geometry and projective geometry form brief, self-contained treatments.\r\nMore than 100 exercises with answers and 200 diagrams illuminate the text. Teachers, students (particularly those majoring in mathematics education), and mathematically minded readers will appreciate this outstanding exploration of the role of geometry in the development of Western scientific thought","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f16269c63c913d81c587fc4ad83a659fb7b82816","amp;dn":"A+New+Look+at+Geometry+-+RePrint+Edition+%282012%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f16269c63c913d81c587fc4ad83a659fb7b82816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,98,105,198,60,145,61,129,197,135,252,74,216,58,101,159,183,184,40,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
