Only two King of Fighters games were made on the Atomiswave platform (The King of Fighters Neowave and The King of Fighters XI) before SNK decided to discontinue using the platform for the series. The current arcade hardware for the series is the Taito Type X2, with its first usage coming with the release of The King of Fighters XII. Ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games have been released for several video games consoles.\r\n\r\nThe torrent has following files inside:\r\nKing of Fighters 1994\r\nKing of Fighters 1995\r\nKing of Fighters 1996\r\nKing of Fighters 1997\r\nKing of Fighters 1998\r\nKing of Fighters 1999\r\nKing of Fighters 2000\r\nKing of Fighters 2001\r\nKing of Fighters 2002\r\nKing of Fighters 2003\r\nKing of Fighters XI\r\nAtomis Wave plugin\r\nNeoGeo plugin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04df34899b1e220133c9694076a957a1d8513c0e","amp;dn":"King+of+Fighters+Collection+MAME","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04df34899b1e220133c9694076a957a1d8513c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,223,52,137,155,30,34,1,51,201,105,64,118,169,87,161,216,81,60,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
