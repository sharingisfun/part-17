One of these students, Issei Hyodo, is a lecherous second-year human student there who lives a peaceful life. After an ordinary school day, Issei is spontaneously asked out on a date by a girl named Yuma Amano. The day of their date, Yuma brings Issei to a local park and makes startling request. She reveals herself as Raynare, a fallen angel. Issei is nearly killed by Yuma. Using his summoning card, Rias Gremory, a buxom third-year student at Kuoh Academy, revives him. Issei wakes up the next morning, thinking that the events that occurred were all just a dream. Immediately after being attacked by another fallen angel and waking up, he notices Rias naked in his room. Rias reveals her true identity as a devil to Issei and says that she has reincarnated him as a devil, becoming his new master in the process.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f94e5082c3f0bf4a6fd5db7874a2c97f8e0052f","amp;dn":"High+School+DxD+Season+1-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f94e5082c3f0bf4a6fd5db7874a2c97f8e0052f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,148,229,8,44,63,11,244,166,253,93,183,135,74,44,151,248,224,5,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
