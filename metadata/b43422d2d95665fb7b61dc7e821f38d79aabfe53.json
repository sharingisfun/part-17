AWS provides big data at a small cost, offering one of the most full-featured and scalable data solutions around. Start here to explore your storage and framework options when working with data services on the Amazon cloud. Your guide, Lynn Langit, a working big data architect, helps you parse through the storage of files, relational data, semistructured data (in NoSQL), data warehousing, graph databases, and Hadoop. Plus, discover how these solutions translate to real-world scenarios involving businesses of different sizes and needs, including startups and enterprise clients.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tWhy cloud tools matter\r\n\tâ€¢\tStorage choices on AWS\r\n\tâ€¢\tRDBMSs such as Core RDS, Aurora, and Oracle\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with semistructured data in NoSQL\r\n\tâ€¢\tConnecting to data warehouses such as AWS Redshift and Snowflake\r\n\tâ€¢\tGraph databases and AWS Machine Learning\r\n\tâ€¢\tWorking with Hadoop\r\n\tâ€¢\tCommon data scenarios and architectures\r\n\r\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43422d2d95665fb7b61dc7e821f38d79aabfe53","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Amazon+Web+Services+Data+Services","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43422d2d95665fb7b61dc7e821f38d79aabfe53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,52,34,210,217,86,101,251,123,97,220,126,130,31,56,215,154,171,254,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
