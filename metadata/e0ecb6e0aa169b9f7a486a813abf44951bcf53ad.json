You have had difficulty building correct Farsi sentences. With high hopes, you wanted to speak Farsi with your husband, wife, grandmother, grandfather, relatives, and friends. This was your dream, but no success!\n\nThe students who focus on conjugating the verbs while speaking have some troubles in speaking fluent Farsi. Furthermore, some students use vocabulary words that are old fashioned from over 500 years ago! They themselves get confused the listeners as well! They may feel sad and frustrated because they tried for months or even years and now they can't speak Farsi in a natural way! All their efforts useless, just because they didn't choose the right method!\n\nLet me show you how I have tackled all those barriers for you with my new teaching method. I want to make your dream of learning Farsi come true. Let me prove to you that the method is the only thing that matters, not your age or your ability to learn Farsi.\n\nIn this course you will directly use and link vocabulary words to create your own new sentences. This course links new Farsi (Persian) words together and enables you to speak automatically, just like a spider that easily knots and spins! Rapidly you will gain confidence in linking new vocabulary words together after finishing each lesson!\n\nSpiderFarsi is a step-by-step method. The course takes you little by little from zero to a level that you can easily communicate in all Farsi speaking countries such as Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikestan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ecb6e0aa169b9f7a486a813abf44951bcf53ad","amp;dn":"Spider+Farsi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ecb6e0aa169b9f7a486a813abf44951bcf53ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,236,182,224,170,22,155,159,122,72,106,129,58,191,68,149,27,207,83,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
