Yet, less than three years after her early death in 2013, her name is little known, and her work largely forgotten.\r\nThis documentary aims to put that right - the first to examine her legacy and to place Antonia Bird where she belongs, among the most important British directors of the past 40 years. Filmmaker Susan Kemp reveals the secrets behind Antonia's greatest films - such as Safe, Priest, Face, Ravenous, The Hamburg Cell and Care - through intimate interviews many of her closest collaborators, including actors Robert Carlyle, Anita Dobson, Kate Hardie and Steven Mackintosh, and writers Irvine Welsh, Ronan Bennett and Kay Mellor.\r\nAntonia's career was a long fight to get her voice heard, and to give voice to the powerless and the abused, the misfits and outcasts left behind our society and let down by its institutions - homeless teenagers, kids in care, criminal addicts in recovery, priests struggling with their sexuality, even the 9/11 hijackers and cannibals in the Old West.\r\nYet her politics and her gender meant she was often blocked. This documentary brings to life the battles - the victories and defeats - of this shy but passionate woman.\r\nThis is also the story of Britain over the past 40 years, a period of convulsive and painful transformation.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/From-EastEnders-to-Hollywood-Antonia-Bird-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19.5 (~1833Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.47 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 89 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.22 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07chwf7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce3f1724044fc4bb35178ed8140f289b8ec2bb77","amp;dn":"BBC+From+EastEnders+to+Hollywood+Antonia+Bird+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce3f1724044fc4bb35178ed8140f289b8ec2bb77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,63,23,36,4,79,196,187,53,23,142,216,20,15,40,155,142,194,187,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
