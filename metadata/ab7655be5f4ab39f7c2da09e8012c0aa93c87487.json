None too impressed by this sudden humanitarian leaning however, the cyborgs' boss (John Saxon) decides to have our hero wiped out.\n\nMeanwhile our cyborg seeks solace at a diner in the middle of the Arizona desert where he hopes to be left alone. Unfortunately, he just seems to attract trouble like a dog turd does flies and even in this desolate location he manages to get on the wrong side of some local truckers headed by big George Eastman who challenges our hero to an arm wrestling bout.\n\nVarious bar brawls and further trouble ensue until a sadistic hit-man and the corporate goons eventually catch up with our man and attempt to take care of him for good.\n\nOK so it's obvious that this was made on the cheap but frankly who cares; the action never lets up for a second and is backed by a cool thumping Claudio Simonetti score throughout.\n\nDaniel Greene is admittedly wooden as the lead but nonetheless proves to be perfect physically for the role whilst the supporting cast are all fine and it's always a pleasure to see the lovely Janet Agren on screen.\n\nWatch out also for a direct scene lift from the Terminator where our hero performs some self surgery on his forearm!\n\nTremendously enjoyable from start to finish! If only all films were this much fun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7655be5f4ab39f7c2da09e8012c0aa93c87487","amp;dn":"Hands+of+Steel+%281986%29-+Vendetta+dal+Futuro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7655be5f4ab39f7c2da09e8012c0aa93c87487","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,118,85,190,95,74,179,159,124,45,160,158,128,18,192,170,147,200,116,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
