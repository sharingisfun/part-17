The protagonist of the story is Fridolin, a successful 35-year-old doctor who lives with his wife Albertina (also translated as Albertine) and their young daughter.\n\nIt was first published in instalments in the magazine Die Dame between December 1925 and March 1926. The first book edition appeared in 1926 in S. Fischer Verlag and was adapted in 1999 into the film Eyes Wide Shut by director, screenwriter Stanley Kubrick.\n\nSchnitzler's works were called &quot;Jewish filth&quot; by Adolf Hitler and were banned by the Nazis in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when Joseph Goebbels organized book burnings in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including Einstein, Marx, Kafka, Freud and Stefan Zweig.\n\nThe book belongs to the period of Viennese decadence after the turn of the 20th century.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:533396ac927a66fe64d61b7f5d77db74612036a6","amp;dn":"Dream+Story+by+Arthur+Schnitzler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"533396ac927a66fe64d61b7f5d77db74612036a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,51,150,172,146,122,102,254,100,214,27,127,93,119,219,116,97,32,54,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
