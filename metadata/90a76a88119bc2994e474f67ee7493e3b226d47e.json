The movie tells the story of three young women and two young men who are thrown together. One young woman grabs a box of jewels during the looting when one warlord takes Peking. A deserting soldier joins her, but the jewels end up at the Peking Opera. Here we meet the daughter of the head of the troupe, who dreams of being an actress. But even female roles are played by men in the opera. Soon, the daughter of the currently ruling warlord and a male agent of the democratic underground are involved.\n\n\nRELEASE DATE....: 04/22/2011\nTHEATRE DATE....: 1986\n\nGENRE...........: Comedy | Action\nSOURCE .........: Peking Opera Blues 1986 BluRay 1080p AVC TrueHD 7 1-CHDBits\nViDEO BiTRATE...: x264 L4.1 High @ 9496 Kbps\nFRAME RATE......: 23.976 fps\n\nAUDiO 1.........: Russian Dub\nAUDiO 2.........: Cantonese TrueHD core AC3 5.1 640Kbps\n\nSUBTITLES : Russian &amp; English\n\nRUNTiME.........: 1:45:16 (h:m:s)\nASPECT RATiO....: 1.850 : 1\nRESOLUTiON......: 1916 X 1036\nENCODER.........: SweetSmile@CHD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90a76a88119bc2994e474f67ee7493e3b226d47e","amp;dn":"Peking.Opera.Blues.1986.BluRay.1080p.AC3.x264-CHD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90a76a88119bc2994e474f67ee7493e3b226d47e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,167,106,136,17,155,194,153,78,71,79,103,238,116,147,227,178,38,212,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
