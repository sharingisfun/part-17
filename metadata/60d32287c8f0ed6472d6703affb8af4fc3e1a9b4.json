Chess stalwart Willie Dixon even pays a visit, as does harmonica ace Walter Horton who blows the harp on a great &quot;Mean Mistreater&quot;.\n\nWhile most every other white blues singer in the late 60s was trying to make the blues more palatable to the mainstream pop audience by toning it down a little, Winter makes no concessions to pop sensibility at all. His guitar playing is pure and savage, yet he never resorts to meaningless shredding, and his prowess on the acoustic slide guitar is impressive...just listen to his self-penned &quot;Dallas&quot;, a perfectly authentic slice of Delta blues.\n\nThere is barely a weak track on this fine record. Contained here is some of the best and certainly most authentic blues ever recorded by a white bluesman, and &quot;Johnny Winter&quot; is the perfect introduction to the albino guitarist, as well as being one of his two or three best albums.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60d32287c8f0ed6472d6703affb8af4fc3e1a9b4","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+-+Johnny+Winter%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60d32287c8f0ed6472d6703affb8af4fc3e1a9b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,211,34,135,200,240,237,100,114,214,112,58,255,184,175,79,195,225,169,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
