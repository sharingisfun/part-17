Penetration Testing and Network Defense offers detailed steps on how to emulate an outside attacker in order to assess the security of a network.\n\nUnlike other books on hacking, this book is specifically geared towards penetration testing. It includes important information about liability issues and ethics as well as procedures and documentation. Using popular open-source and commercial applications, the book shows you how to perform a penetration test on an organizationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s network, from creating a test plan to performing social engineering and host reconnaissance to performing simulated attacks on both wired and wireless networks.\n\nPenetration Testing and Network Defense also goes a step further than other books on hacking, as it demonstrates how to detect an attack on a live network. By detailing the method of an attack and how to spot an attack on your network, this book better prepares you to guard against hackers. You will learn how to configure, record, and thwart these attacks and how to harden a system to protect it against future internal and external attacks.\n\nFull of real-world examples and step-by-step procedures, this book is both an enjoyable read and full of practical advice that will help you assess network security and develop a plan for locking down sensitive data and company resources.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis book goes to great lengths to explain the various testing approaches that are used today and gives excellent insight into how a responsible penetration testing specialist executes his trade.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bruce Murphy, Vice President, World Wide Security Services, Cisco Systems\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 624 pages\nPublisher: Cisco Press (October 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1587052083\nISBN-13: 978-1587052088","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e07dc1dad4af5b93c278d09dbe75c871a3f55c","amp;dn":"Cisco.Press.Penetration.Testing.and.Network.Defense.Oct.2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e07dc1dad4af5b93c278d09dbe75c871a3f55c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,224,125,193,218,212,175,91,147,194,120,208,157,190,117,200,113,163,245,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
