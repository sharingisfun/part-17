(For simplicity, i'll name this folder 'EXTRACTED').\n2. Extract the contents of your downloaded Windows .ISO image to the folder named 'EXTRACTED' using e.g. PowerISO.\n3. Create a 2nd folder on your desktop. (For simplicity, i'll name it 'COMPILED').\n4. Run/click WBICreator.\n5. From the 1st drop down menu, select the O/S type (For simplicity, i'll be using Windows 7).\n6. In the 'CD/DVD Label' window, name it what you like.\n7. In the 'Setup Location' window, navigate to and select the 'EXTRACTED' folder.\n8. In the 'Output Path' navigate to and select the 'COMPILED' folder.\n9. Click 'GO'.\n10. Once the process has finished, a bootable Windows 7 .ISO has been created in the folder named 'COMPILED'.\n11.

Navigate to the Windows 7 .ISO youve downloaded and want to transfer to the USB.\nWhen youve found the Windows 7 .ISO. Click on it ONLY ONCE and click 'Open'.\n11) Once you've done that, click on 'Make USB Bootable'.\n12) Youll then get a pop up window saying:\n\n'All device data and partitions will be lost with it. Continue?'.\n\n13) Click 'Yes'.\n\nWindows USB Maker will now transfer Windows 7 to the USB and make it bootable.\n\nItll take a little time and at times, itll seem like it's not working (hanging). This is normal, give it time.\n\n\nFinally, when the process is complete, make sure you eject the USB correctly.\n\n\n\n\nWinAIO Maker:\n=============\n=============\n\n\nInstructions:\n=============\n\n\n1) Install application as normal.\n2.
