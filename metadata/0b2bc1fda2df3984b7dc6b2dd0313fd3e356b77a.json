(AMG)\n\n\n\n\n\nArguably the best album to come from the Suicidal Tendencies, &quot;How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today&quot; combines the frenzied thrash sound of ST's classic debut with the slower tempos of &quot;Join the Army&quot;. \nMike Muir's lyrics reached unprecidented heights on &quot;Trip at the Brain&quot; (which is possibly one of the best album openers ever), &quot;Pledge Your Allegiance&quot;, &quot;Miracle&quot;, &quot;If I Don't Wake Up&quot;, and &quot;One Too Many Times&quot;, but his maturity as a songwriter reaches the breaking point on the classic title track, which is one of the most revered songs to ever come from the band. All in all, this is headbanging hard rock done right, and if you are new to the band, this is a great place to start.
