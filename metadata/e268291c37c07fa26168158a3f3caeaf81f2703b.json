They took down their large web site of crochet patterns. We whined and they put it up for a couple of months so that everybody who knew about it could get all the patterns that they wanted.  I wanted afghan and shawl patterns, so this file reflects things I thought I might make in the future.  \n\nEach pattern is a separate file that I copied and pasted from the web site. They are saved in rich text format so that you have a photo along with the instructions.  \n\nPlease, be sure to read the pattern to be sure no chart is missing before you buy yarn or start the project.  I tried to be very careful, but ya know, things happen. Enjoy these patterns!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e268291c37c07fa26168158a3f3caeaf81f2703b","amp;dn":"Crochet+Afghans+and+Shawls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e268291c37c07fa26168158a3f3caeaf81f2703b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,104,41,28,55,192,127,162,97,104,21,138,63,60,174,175,129,242,112,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
