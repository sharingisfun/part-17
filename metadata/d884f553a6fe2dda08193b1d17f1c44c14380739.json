Last Tuesday was New Year&amp;#039;s day, so there was no episode on Showcase.  They were playing movies all night.  I suppose the fat-suit episode may have been aired on the Friday night &amp;#039;repeat&amp;#039; timeslot, but I forgot to tune in.  Although up until last night, showcase.ca was advertising the fat episode as airing tonight, so who knows.  Hopefully it&amp;#039;ll get shown again soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d884f553a6fe2dda08193b1d17f1c44c14380739","amp;dn":"Kenny+Vs+Spenny+410+-+Who+Can+Commit+The+Most+Crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d884f553a6fe2dda08193b1d17f1c44c14380739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,132,245,83,166,254,45,218,8,25,59,29,23,241,196,76,20,56,7,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
