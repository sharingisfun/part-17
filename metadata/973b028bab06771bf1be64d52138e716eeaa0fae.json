Drawn from research of indigenous tribes, ancient rituals, and Christian mystics, this resource teaches that heart consciousnessÃ¢â‚¬â€the idea of the heart as the ultimate truth of creation and the way in which people connect with each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€will enable harmony, peace, and satisfaction. Also illustrating that there is something crucially lacking in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s society because of the disconnect to the heart, this important investigation encourages readers to be open to love, the fundamental physiological aspect through which true inner peace, normally lost in childhood, can be rediscovered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973b028bab06771bf1be64d52138e716eeaa0fae","amp;dn":"The+Heart%27s+Note%3A+Sounding+Love+in+Your+Life+from+Your+Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973b028bab06771bf1be64d52138e716eeaa0fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,59,2,139,171,6,119,27,241,190,100,213,33,56,231,22,238,170,15,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
