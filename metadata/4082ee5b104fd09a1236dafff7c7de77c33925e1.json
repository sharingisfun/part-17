For art its freedom.&quot; For turn-of-the-century Europe, its art was Art Nouveau, a style hallmarked by curved lines and natural forms like flowers and plants. After a period of respite, Art Nouveau reemerged in a big way in the 1960s and has remained in the designer's repertoire ever since. In this Type Project course, Nigel French shows you how to recreate a type treatment in the Art Nouveau style, using Illustrator, Photoshop, historically appropriate typefaces and colors, and ornamental elements that entwine with the letterforms themselves.\n\nWant more Art Nouveau inspiration?
