His bumbling ways, can\\\\\\'t even be helped by his best friend and room mate Studly. Filled with a fantastic soundtrack, that makes the movie worth watching alone. Great sounds from The buzzcocks, The untouchables and The Fleshtones. They don\\\\\\'t make em like this anymore!\n\nStarring Matthew Causey &amp; Tim Carhart\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087889/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087889/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04fd48d015cc71af87ca55c375242b992f698330","amp;dn":"The.Party.Animal.1984.DVDRip.XviD.sonnyr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04fd48d015cc71af87ca55c375242b992f698330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,253,72,208,21,204,113,175,135,202,85,195,117,36,43,153,47,105,131,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
