This age-old axiom proves true with Absolute Worship, a 25-track collection of recently-released modern worship songs recorded by second- and third-tier artists in Christian music. But don't let the anonymity fool you as there are plenty of gems on these two discs. Disc One seems to be the stronger with Big Daddy Weave's &quot;Audience of One,&quot; Jeremy Camp's &quot;Empty Me,&quot; Lincoln Brewster's &quot;Power of Your Love,&quot; and Tree63's &quot;Treasure,&quot; all melodic and pleasing in their own distinctive styles. Darrell Evans' powerful ballad &quot;All We Want Is You&quot; and Telecast's hard-charging &quot;The Way&quot; also shine as does &quot;Traveling Light,&quot; the cheerfully rollicking duet by Joel Hanson and Sara Groves. Disc Two is no slouch, either, with Watermark's enchanting &quot;Holy&quot; and By The Tree's &quot;Wait,&quot; which conjures up plenty of Lennon-McCartney late-period comparisons. Ginny Owens, perhaps the most well-known artist on the double-disc, offers her hauntingly beautiful &quot;If You Want Me To&quot; which caps off the release. The Absolute Worship collection is yet another example for Christian artists in how pervasive the modern worship movement is as well as how deep the roster is of good songwriters. \n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d7add20b9c235bd9ac7303a95fba66f7289fb9","amp;dn":"Absolute+Worship+-+2004+-+Absolute+Worship","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d7add20b9c235bd9ac7303a95fba66f7289fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,215,173,210,11,156,35,91,217,172,115,3,169,95,186,102,247,40,159,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
