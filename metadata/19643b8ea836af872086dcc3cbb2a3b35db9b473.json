Are you still there? Derango\\\\\\&amp;#039;s debut album is...\n\n...pure twisted psychedelic forest trance from Sweden.\n\nMysterious atmospheres give way to corrosive noise spasms, assembled to powerful bouncy kick and bass combinations with percussive dirges, tribal feel, melodius distortion and occasional hints of obscurity.\n\nIt is all there, solidly composed and arranged displaying indisputable craftsmanship. Music of a shadowy, majestic ancient nature, an entire soundtrack to forbidden acid pagan rituals that invoke the elder gods of creation and all sort of holy-unholy allegiances.\n\n\\\\\\&amp;#039;Tumult\\\\\\&amp;#039; definitely stands out among other current releases and is a must-listen for anyone into fast new groundbreaking full psychedelic trance, or anyone just looking for something different.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19643b8ea836af872086dcc3cbb2a3b35db9b473","amp;dn":"Derango+-+Tumult+%5Bgem%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19643b8ea836af872086dcc3cbb2a3b35db9b473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,100,59,142,168,54,175,135,32,134,220,195,203,178,163,179,93,185,180,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
