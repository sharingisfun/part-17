There&amp;#039;s no box-office draw in sight -- there isn&amp;#039;t even a good action scene to put in the trailers -- but those who go out on a limb and watch it should be completely entertained\n\nReview:\n- http://www.ultimate-movie.com/review.php?n=monday\n\n\nPosters:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filmspiegel.de/filme/monday/poster.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filmspiegel.de/filme/monday/poster.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.filmbesprechungen.de/cover/monday_kino.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.filmbesprechungen.de/cover/monday_kino.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1b47c27350309a3fb61ffcfdca23b69d1e363ce","amp;dn":"Monday.2000.DVDRip.DivX-SABU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1b47c27350309a3fb61ffcfdca23b69d1e363ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,180,124,39,53,3,9,163,251,97,255,207,220,162,59,105,209,227,99,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
