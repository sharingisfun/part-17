The Inuit language is grouped under Eskimo-Aleut languages.[1]\n\nThe Inuit people live throughout most of the Canadian Arctic and subarctic: in the territory of Nunavut (&quot;our land&quot;); the northern third of Quebec, in an area called Nunavik (&quot;place to live&quot;); the coastal region of Labrador, in an area called Nunatsiavut (&quot;Our Beautiful Land&quot;); in various parts of the Northwest Territories, mainly on the coast of the Arctic Ocean and formerly in the Yukon territory. In the US, Alaskan Inupiat live on the North Slope of Alaska and the Seward Peninsula. Greenland's Kalaallit are citizens of Denmark.
