This book will enable you to free yourself from the crippling effects of anxiety and to go on to a happier and more fulfilled life. The authors describe simple self-help techniques and practical tips derived from years of helping people with anxiety problems. This book enables the reader to: assess what changes you need to make; create a personal recovery programme; set realistic goals and work towards them; change unhelpful ways of thinking; and, take back control of your life. The techniques can be used for all forms of anxiety: phobias (including Agoraphobia and Social Phobia), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic Attacks and General Anxiety Disorder. However bad your anxiety, and however long you've had it, you can recover. Using true life examples from anxiety sufferers, this book shows you just how you can do it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5ddbd1eb2bb8974f01c8c2d90896ca7db06c24e","amp;dn":"Free+Yourself+From+Anxiety+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5ddbd1eb2bb8974f01c8c2d90896ca7db06c24e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,221,189,30,178,187,137,116,240,28,140,45,144,137,108,167,219,6,194,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
