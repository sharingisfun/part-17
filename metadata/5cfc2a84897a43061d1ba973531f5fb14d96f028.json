He kills his first wife (Mona Washbourne), hoping to claim her inheritance. Surprise! The inheritance is a myth. Thus Bogarde sets his sights on barkeeper Margaret Lockwood, whom he knows to be heavily insured. \nBut Lockwood is possessed of a naturally suspicious nature, making Bogarde's second murder plot a bit more delicate than his first. Cast a Dark Shadow is a \ntoo-literal adaptation of Janet Green's stage play Murder Mistaken.\n\n\n\nDirector: Lewis Gilbert\nStars:Dirk Bogarde, Margaret Lockwood \n\nRuntime: 82 min\nMp4 \nSample\nSubtitles .srt :  Spanish, Portuguese\n\n\n\n\n* Converted from torrent posted by &quot;pirpawn&quot; (Thanks !)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cfc2a84897a43061d1ba973531f5fb14d96f028","amp;dn":"Cast+a+Dark+Shadow+-+1955+-+Mp4+-+Dirk+Bogarde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cfc2a84897a43061d1ba973531f5fb14d96f028","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,252,42,132,137,122,67,6,29,27,169,115,83,31,95,177,77,150,240,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
