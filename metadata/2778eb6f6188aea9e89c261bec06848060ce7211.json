The third edition is compatible with the new NumPy implementation and features updated information, correction of errors, and improved associated software tools.\n\nWritten for:\nUndergraduate students in computer science, computational science and engineering; researchers\n\nKeywords:\n\n    * Python\n    * computational experiments\n    * computational science\n    * gluing applications\n    * graphical user interfaces\n    * multi-language programming\n    * scientific computing\n    * scripting\n    * text processing\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2778eb6f6188aea9e89c261bec06848060ce7211","amp;dn":"Python+Scripting+for+Computational+Science+-+Langtangen%2C+Hans+Pe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2778eb6f6188aea9e89c261bec06848060ce7211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,120,235,111,97,136,174,169,232,156,38,27,236,6,132,128,96,206,114,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
