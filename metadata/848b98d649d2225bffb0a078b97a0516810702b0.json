The player's team finds itself instantly engaging in battles with raiders, mutants and a bevy of radioactive nightmares using a mixture of 50 different up-close melee and ranged weapons. Gamers can get right into the mix in the single-player, story driven game, or if a close friend is at hand, both can start up a co-op game to play from start to finish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:848b98d649d2225bffb0a078b97a0516810702b0","amp;dn":"Fallout%3A+Brotherhood+Of+Steel+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"848b98d649d2225bffb0a078b97a0516810702b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,139,152,214,73,210,34,91,255,176,160,120,185,122,5,22,129,7,2,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
