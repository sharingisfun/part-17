Emerging technologies are discussed and signal processing issues are addressed, providing the background knowledge and practical tools needed to develop future radio technologies. Real-world examples are included, together with global spectrum regulations and policies, for a practical approach to developing technologies for worldwide applications. Cross analog and digital design guidelines are provided to help cut design time and cost. This holistic, system level view of transceiver design for white space technologies is ideal for practising engineers and students and researchers in academia.\n\nBook Description\nIncrease the efficient use of time-varying available spectrum with this book, the first to describe RF hardware design for white space applications, including both analog and digital approaches. Including real-world examples, global spectrum regulations and policies, and cross analog and digital design guidelines to help cut design time and cost.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nNuÃƒÂ±o Borges Carvalho is a Full Professor at the University of Aveiro and Senior Research Scientist in the Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, Portugal.
