Loco's in this class took their names from former Star Class locomotives, great Britons and Scottish firths. The last 7MT was withdrawn from service in 1968.\r\n\r\nTwo locomotives came into preservation - 70000 Britannia and 70013 Oliver Cromwell - and both are currently in steam. Both are included in this superb pack along with nameplates that cover every locomotive in the class.\r\n\r\nThis collection features highly detailed BR 7MT locomotives in six variants, with black and green liveries in clean, intermediate and heavily weathered conditions. Region-dependent details are available on all variants; these can be set via the Scenario Editor and include Western Region lamps for Western Region locomotives and Southern Region discs with lamp irons on the smokebox door for Southern Region locoâ€™s.\r\n\r\nYou can now enjoy driving this magnificent class of locomotive in Train Simulator and experience its range of Advanced features which have all been developed to the very highest standards. 10 exciting Standard scenarios are included,  with an approximate driving time of 13 hours, as well as three Free Roams.\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL WORK ON LEGIT AND PIRATED VERSION OF TRAIN SIMULATOR 2016!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9589c60b23bfcc5752efc1513a64f29bf2450f7d","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+Just+Trains+BR+7MT+Advanced","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9589c60b23bfcc5752efc1513a64f29bf2450f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,137,198,11,35,191,204,87,82,239,193,81,58,100,242,155,242,69,15,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
