Siouxsie&amp;#039;s first solo recording without The Banshees or The Creatures will be released on October 2. MANTARAY, produced by Steve Evans (Robert Plant) and Charlie Jones is fresh and contemporary, while remaining immediately recognizable. Incorporating industrial rhythms, modern glam and other orgainic elements, Siouxsie&amp;#039;s iconic vocals are showcased in a newly expansive sound across the whole album. Since her first appearance onstage in 1976 at the 100 Club Punk Festival, Siouxsie has been a pioneer. She captivated audiences with her dramatic, compelling presence that pushed, then broke, boundaries. Her continually evolving style--from chaotic, aggressive punk to sophisticated, glossy pop--resulted in an impressive canon of work that continues to remain provocative today.\n\n\n*** TRACK LISTING ***\n\n1.\tInto A Swan\n2.\tAbout To Happen\n3.\tHere Comes That Day\n4.\tLoveless\n5.\tIf It Doesn&amp;#039;t Kill You\n6.\tOne Mile Below\n7.\tDrone Zone\n8.\tSea Of Tranquility\n9.\tThey Follow You\n10.\tHeaven And Alchemy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eccc1b6963f2b468ead94f0f9189f3c47e2e3ac1","amp;dn":"Siouxsie+Sioux+-+Mantaray+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eccc1b6963f2b468ead94f0f9189f3c47e2e3ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,204,27,105,99,242,180,104,234,217,79,15,145,137,243,196,126,46,58,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
