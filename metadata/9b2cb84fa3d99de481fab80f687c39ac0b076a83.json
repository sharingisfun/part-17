I'm now sharing them all in one package.\n\n01. Microsoft Virtual PC 7 with Win XP Pro\n02. VPC7 supplied Windows XP Pro (you will need this if you want to use Win XP on the VPC emulator)\n03. Apple QuickTime 6.0 Pro (11 different numbers)\n04. Apple Motion\n05-08. Macromedia Studio MX: Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash and FreeHand\n09-12. Macromedia Studio MX 2004: Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash and FreeHand\n13. Microsoft Office 2004\n14-15. Apple iWork '05 - Pages and Keynote\n16. Apple Final Cut Pro HD 4.5\n17. Apple Final Cut Pro HD 4.0\n18. FileMaker Pro 7\n19-23. Adobe Creative Suite: Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, GoLive, Acrobat Professional\n\nI haven't bothered to arrange them or make a uniform collection out of it and there is no guarantee that they all will work - some of them is quite old. But it's better to share them than not to share them anyway, I think ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2cb84fa3d99de481fab80f687c39ac0b076a83","amp;dn":"Serial+numbers+for+23+Mac+OS-apps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b2cb84fa3d99de481fab80f687c39ac0b076a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,44,184,79,163,217,157,228,129,250,184,15,104,124,57,172,11,7,106,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
