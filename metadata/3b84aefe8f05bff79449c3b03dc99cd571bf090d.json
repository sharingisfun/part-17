Close enough I figure. One of the best bands to hit the scene. Check out some of their more recent albums, and go see them if they come near your town. Great band.\n\nKelowna is a small town in British Columbia, Canada. We have a great local music scene, and with a bit of stimulus, it could be even better. Please seed, please tell your friends about what this town has to offer. Hit up www.kelownagigs.com and come out to a show. I guarantee you'll have a good time, and you'll here some great tunes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b84aefe8f05bff79449c3b03dc99cd571bf090d","amp;dn":"Bend+Sinister+-+Through+the+Broken+City","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b84aefe8f05bff79449c3b03dc99cd571bf090d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,132,174,254,143,5,191,247,148,73,195,176,61,201,156,213,113,191,9,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
