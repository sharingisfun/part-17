Do you have a list of improvements you'll make later? Are the number of people subscribing to your channel too low?\r\n\r\nYou're not alone.\r\n\r\nThis digital workbook is designed to help you grow your channel and transform it into the community you've always dreamed of, one step at a time.\r\nGive me 30 Days and I'll give you a dramatically better YouTube channel, guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThis is not a book of cookie-cutter tips and tricks, but rather a process that leads to a channel that is highly subscribable and turns viewers into a loyal, dedicated community.\r\n\r\nWhere This Book Will Take You\r\nOn March 2, 2006, I created my first YouTube channel and uploaded my first video. It was fun! In fact, my girlfriend and I started making videos of our dates together. Later those videos would be called â€œvlogs,â€ but at the time no one had coined that term yet.\r\n\r\nFast forward a few years to 2008. Weâ€™re married, have several hundred videos on our channel, and a little over 300 subscribers. I was proud of the viewers who were slowly trickling in, but I saw some other YouTubers with large, dedicated audiences, and thought, â€œWow, how did that happen?â€ I noticed many of the comments on these creatorsâ€™ videos were people sharing how they were impacted by the content and how it was changing their lives. I was intrigued.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur channel is fun,â€ I thought, â€œbut itâ€™s not doing that to anyoneâ€™s life. And itâ€™s certainly not growing like theirâ€™s is.â€\r\n\r\nI struck out to the web one evening to start learning more about how YouTube works, what attracts viewers to certain videos, how to develop an audience, and most importantly, how this medium could be used to spread messages that influence people and change lives. At the time there wasnâ€™t much written on the subject, so I had to figure a lot it out for myself, which was fine. It was probably better for me that way anyway. I studied other creators, their audiences, and how they presented their videos.\r\n\r\nThen the funniest thing happened. I started implementing some ideas on our channel and it started to grow! More and more subscribers were coming in and, like the other channels I looked up to, commenters started to interact both with me and each other!\r\n\r\nIn 2010 I started talking publicly about what I was learning regarding audience development on YouTube and, surprisingly, others listened.\r\n\r\nIn January, 2013, I launched the Video Creators YouTube channel to focus more on helping creators develop their channels. Within 12 months, the Video Creators channel grew from 0 to 10,000 subscribers! I also was invited by YouTube themselves to come out to their headquarters become officially certified in â€œAudience Growth.â€ And to top it all off, Video Creators became my full-time job as I taught these strategies to more and more of Americaâ€™s top brands. All within 12 months!\r\n\r\nI know Iâ€™m not alone in not only wanting to grow a YouTube channel, but to do it in a way that forms a tight community and changes lives. Thatâ€™s what this book is all about. Both myself and other creators have used these strategies to grow an audience of thousands of subscribers, millions of views, and full-time incomes. And we did it all without spending a dime on marketing or promotion. One hundred precent of it is pure, organic growth that will continue to exponentially increase over time.\r\n\r\nWould you like to join us?
