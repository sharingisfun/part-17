Cole's first stereophonic long player, 1957's Love Is the Thing remains the epitome of the pair's undeniable compatibility, and it topped the album charts for eight weeks. The opener &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; is considered by many to be nothing short of definitive; the restrained orchestration perfectly adapts to the singer's verdant vocals. Similarly, &quot;Stardust&quot; sparkles as a flawless musical alliance is formed with Cole's warm and inviting narrative weaving over Jenkins' intimate score. Simply stated, both songs are unmitigated masterworks -- and we're only two cuts into the dozen-song LP. Another key to the project's success is Jenkins ability to reign in just enough instrumentation to support Cole's uniformly restrained leads. Examples abound throughout, with &quot;Stay as Sweet as You Are,&quot; &quot;At Last,&quot; and the rural sophistication of &quot;When Sunny Gets Blue.&quot; The heartfelt &quot;Love Letters&quot; and even the comparatively light &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'&quot; incorporate a sonic synergy as the airy string section glides between Cole's line by line phrasing. Also worth mentioning is the Jenkins original &quot;I Thought About Marie,&quot; as it sits comfortably beside some of the most time-honored tunes in 20th century popular music. [Some reissues add three bonus tracks.]\n\n__________________________________\n\nLove Is the Thing is a 1957 album released by American jazz vocalist Nat King Cole. It is the first of four collaborations between Cole and influential arranger Gordon Jenkins. Launching the charting single &quot;Stardust&quot;, which peaked at #79, the album reached #1 on Billboard's &quot;Pop Albums&quot; chart and tied at #1 on the UK Charts with the soundtrack for the 1956 film The King and I. According to the records of the RIAA, the album achieved gold status in 1960 and broke platinum in 1992.\n\nOverview:\nIn 1956, Cole came together with popular music arranger Jenkins to produce the first of the four collaborations that are described by critics as among the best of either artist. American Jazz commenter Scott Yanow noted that the album &quot;sticks exclusively&quot; to the role Cole had established in 1950s popular opinion as a &quot;superb ballad vocalist&quot;. While Love Is the Thing little reflects the jazz roots whence Cole emerged, the singer's &quot;restrained vocal approach&quot; and the arranger's &quot;unhurried string charts&quot; combined to produce a romantic album of enduring popularity.\n\nCole's three further albums with Jenkins were The Very Thought of You (1958), Everytime I Feel the Spirit (1959), and Where Did Everyone Go? (1963).\n\nRelease History:\nOriginally released by Capitol Records, the album has been re-issued by various companies in alternate forms. A 1996 LP re-release on audiophile vinyl by the Digital Compact Classics (DCC) label included two bonus tracks. In 2007, The Collectors' Choice label reissued the album in conjunction with the final Cole/Jenkins collaboration on a single disc entitled Love Is the Thing/Where Did Everyone Go? In 2010 the audiophile Analogue Productions label issued a hybrid SACD of the album, containing its original 12 tracks in mono, stereo, and three-track multichannel sound.\n\nReleased as Capitol W-824 (mono mix) in January 1957 with the  original 12 songs. The stereo LP version with only 10 songs was released as SW-824 in April 1959. The 180g DCC LP is the first LP since 1968 to restore &quot;Love Is The Thing&quot; to its original length and running order. The 3-track original tapes of &quot;Maybe It's Because I Love You Too Much&quot; and &quot;Love Letters&quot; were lost after being left off the stereo LP of Love Is The Thing. These two songs were never mixed to stereo and are presented here in the original pristine monaural form","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b9ed93631e812fc8d4b3d3332f88987c6ab46b","amp;dn":"+Nat+King+Cole+-+Love+Is+The+Thing+%5BVinyl+DCC+LPZ2029%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b9ed93631e812fc8d4b3d3332f88987c6ab46b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,185,237,147,99,30,129,47,200,212,179,211,51,47,136,152,124,106,180,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
