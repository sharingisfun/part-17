Crow, Maxwell T. Boykoff\nHardcover: 252 pages\nPublisher: Routledge (May 7, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 041566148X\nISBN-13: 978-0415661485\n\n===================================================================================\nBook Description\nPublication Date: May 7, 2014 | ISBN-10: 041566148X | ISBN-13: 978-0415661485\nFocusing on cultural values and norms as they are translated into politics and policy outcomes, this book presents a unique contribution in combining research from varied disciplines and from both the developed and developing world.\nThis collection draws from multiple perspectives to present an overview of the knowledge related to our current understanding of climate change politics and culture. It is divided into four sections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Culture and Values, Communication and Media, Politics and Policy, and Future Directions in Climate Politics Scholarship Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each followed by a commentary from a key expert in the field. The book includes analysis of the challenges and opportunities for establishing successful communication on climate change among scientists, the media, policy-makers, and activists.\nWith an emphasis on the interrelation between social, cultural, and political aspects of climate change communication, this volume should be of interest to students and scholars of climate change, environment studies, environmental policy, communication, cultural studies, media studies, politics, sociology.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nThis important new book explores the cultural politics of climate change. With dispatches from the front lines of diverse fields and geographies, the authors provide some of the first maps of this fast evolving landscape underlying some of the most important decisions humanity will make in the 21st century.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œAnthony Leiserowitz, Yale University, USA\n\nClimate change is the most important environmental challenge we face yet there has been little political action to address the problem. This volume examines the reasons for inaction, by considering different cultural and ethical perspectives and how the media plays a role in translating and presenting scientific information. It provides the most comprehensive assessment available, by leading experts in the field.Ã¢â‚¬â€œRaymond Bradley, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, USA\n\nIf you can't keep up with the fire hose of daily information and communication about climate change, much less make sense of what it all means and what it tells us about not just our climate, but also about our culture, the media, and the politics that choreograph our dance around the burning question of what to do about the problem, then I recommend you find a comfortable chair, step back from the heat, and read this book. Here are some great people trying to sort out the complex terrain of media and culture that lies between our everyday lives and the &quot;grand stage&quot; of climate change politics and policy-making. It is not all pretty, but it is helpful, and therefore hopeful.Ã¢â‚¬â€œSusanne Moser, Susanne Moser Research &amp; Consulting, Stanford, USA\n\nThe only thing more complex than the climate system is the tangle of meanings we've wrapped around it. The varied perspectives gathered in this important book go a long way toward unsnarling the cultural politics of climate changeÃ¢â‚¬â€the first step in weaving the stories and policies weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to move forward.Ã¢â‚¬â€œJean Goodwin, Iowa State University, USA\n\nFrom citizens' perspectives over the 'old' and 'new' media all the way to politics and decision-making Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Crow and BoykoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s volume is an excellent example of a societal turn in the analysis of climate change, and deals with its most pressing issues.Ã¢â‚¬â€œMike Schafer, University of Zurich, Switzerland\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nDeserai A.
