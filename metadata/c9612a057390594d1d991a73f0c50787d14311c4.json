He was the most consistent of the Impressionists in his dedication to painting landscape en plein air (i.e., outdoors). He deviated into figure painting only rarely and, unlike Renoir and Pissarro, found that Impressionism fulfilled his artistic needs.\n\nAmong his important works are a series of paintings of the River Thames, mostly around Hampton, executed in 1874, and landscapes depicting places in or near Moret-sur-Loing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9612a057390594d1d991a73f0c50787d14311c4","amp;dn":"Alfred+Sisley+%281839%26ndash%3B1899%29+%28Art+Paintings%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9612a057390594d1d991a73f0c50787d14311c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,97,42,5,115,144,89,77,29,153,26,115,240,197,7,135,209,67,17,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
