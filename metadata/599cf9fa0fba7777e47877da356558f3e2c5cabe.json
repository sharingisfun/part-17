Timing is a funny thing, for as much time as there actually is, it has an uncanny knack for being extremely precise. Had I come across this album two years ago, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fair chance it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have resonated as much as it does now; so, I use the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœmissedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ quite on purpose as it seems the re-release of China Mountain was timed to show exactly what my Australian winter has been lacking.\n\nLotte Kestner, the solo project of Anna-Lynne Williams, delivers a down-tempo folk album that is both reminiscent of her work as singer-songwriter with Trespassers William, and distinct enough so as not to be derivative. Anna-LynneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moderately hushed and dreamy vocals also give some welcome warmth and depth to the delicate, gently moving songs. Much like Mazzy Star-era Hope Sandoval, the emotion is largely in the words themselves, and they unravel in a similarly haunting fashion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:599cf9fa0fba7777e47877da356558f3e2c5cabe","amp;dn":"Lotte+Kestner...China+Mountain%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"599cf9fa0fba7777e47877da356558f3e2c5cabe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,156,249,250,15,186,119,119,228,120,119,218,53,101,88,243,226,197,202,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
