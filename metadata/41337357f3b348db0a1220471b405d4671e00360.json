Some AV or Antispyware may label it as virus/trojan/hacking-attempt/whatever, but it is also false positive. If you remove that line, then this will not work!\n\nthe lines, that get's added to host file:\n\n#block wga\n127.0.0.1 mpa.one.microsoft.com\n\n\nIt's up to you: take it or leave it!\n\n\nABOUT THE PASSWORD:\nThis archive is password protected to keep your AV not peeking into it.\n\nPassword: password\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAbout this torrent:\n\nThese Prorames included, Enables Pirated XP to become Genuine.\n\n* You No longer need to find cracks via the internet!\n* You Can Download products from Microsoft that uses WGA, Such as Windows Defender, WMP11, IE7, etc\n* Use Windows Update!\n* Another Cool thing is that you can Install Program that Require Validtaion, and you won't need a crack such as WGA Patcher Classics!\nIt i'll say your XP is Genuine!\n\n\n\nUsage:\n\nUnpack this. Like i already told, password is &quot;password&quot; (whitout the quotes) and your AV may label this as trojan. My suggestion is to disconect from net, disable your AV/AntiSpyware and then unpack.\nIn the arhive, there is &quot;WP_Readme.txt&quot; with full instructions how to use this toolset. Follow it!\nNOTE: The instructions are for VLK (corporate editon) \n\nThis has been tested with XP PRO SP3 Corporate editon and it works!\nI don't know if it works with retail editons because i never used retail and probably never will. If it works, then please leave a comment so others would know.\n\nUPDATE: It has now been confirmed, that it works with retail version!\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nIMPORTANT:\n\nHelp the community by reporting fake/bad torrents here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlways use sandboxie if you are not shure about the file you downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=24890&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=24890&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUPLOADERS: add the link of the bad torrent section to your torrent description - Spread awareness\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThanks\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41337357f3b348db0a1220471b405d4671e00360","amp;dn":"Permanent+WGA+Patcher+-+Make+Your+XP+Genuine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41337357f3b348db0a1220471b405d4671e00360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,51,115,87,243,179,72,219,10,18,32,71,27,64,93,70,113,224,3,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
