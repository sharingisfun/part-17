No living actor can match his understanding of language, or his interpretation of character. He will make a superb Smiley, and I feel deeply honoured.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½John le CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© \n\n\nJeremy Howe, Radio 4's Commissioning Editor for Drama, says, &quot;For me The Complete Smiley is the most ambitious drama we have embarked upon in my time at Radio 4. Smiley is one of the great characters of 20th century fiction and the way he threads, weaves, ducks and dives his way through the complexities of the Cold War has given us some of the century's most enthralling stories. Be prepared to spend a lot of your Saturday and Sunday afternoons glued to the radio.&quot;\n\nRecruited into the &quot;Circus&quot; in the late 1920s, when he might so easily have become an Oxford don, George Smiley spends the 1930s and early 1940s working undercover in Nazi Germany in daily fear of betrayal and death.\n\nRecalled in 1943, he marries - to general astonishment - the beautiful but eternally unfaithful Lady Ann Sercomb.\n\nWith the end of the war, he returns to Oxford for a life of scholarly contemplation among the lesser German poets.\n\nBut rising tension between Soviet Russia and the West draw him back to the Circus as a Cold War warrior. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCall For the Dead\nLondon, the late 1950s. A disenchanted Smiley is engaged in the routine job of security vetting. When a Foreign Office civil servant commits suicide not long after being cleared of Communist sympathies, Smiley investigates - and uncovers a deadly conspiracy with its roots in his own wartime past. \nDramatised by Robert Forrest. \n\n\nA Murder of Quality \nA public school in the early 1960s. When the wife of one of the masters is found bludgeoned to death, Smiley, out of loyalty to an old friend, finds himself investigating her death - an investigation that lifts the lid on a world of hidden passions and murderous hatreds. \nDramatised by Shaun McKenna. \n\n\nThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold \nThe height of the Cold War. It is 1962, only months after the building of the Berlin Wall. Alec Leamas, a hard-working, hard-drinking British intelligence officer, finds his network in East Berlin is in complete tatters. All his agents are either on the run or dead, victims of the ruthlessly efficient East German counter-intelligence officer Hans-Dieter Mundt. Leamas is recalled to London. \nDramatised by Robert Forrest. \n\n\nClassic Serial: The Looking Glass War \nWhen word reaches The Department, an ailing section of British military intelligence, that Soviet missiles are being installed close to the West German border, former spy Fred Leiser is lured back from retirement to investigate. But the world has changed since The Department's glory days during the Second World War. The harsh realities of the Cold War now prevail, and there is no place for heroes. \nDramatised by Shaun McKenna. \n\n\nClassic Serial: Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\nPart 1 of the Karla Trilogy. George Smiley, wrestling with retirement and disillusionment, is summoned to a secret meeting with a member of the Cabinet Office. Evidence has emerged that the Circus has been infiltrated at the highest level by a Russian agent. &quot;Find the mole, George. Clean the stables. Do whatever is necessary.&quot; Reluctantly Smiley agrees, and so embarks on a dark journey into his past - a past filled with love, duplicity and betrayal. \nDramatised by Shaun McKenna. \n\nClassic Serial: The Honourable Schoolboy\nPart 2 of the Karla Trilogy. Smiley, now head of the Circus, must rebuild trust in the shattered organisation. He is also determined to destroy his nemesis, Karla, and his spy networks. He recruits Jerry Westerby, occasional spy, occasional news reporter, full-time romantic - The Honourable Schoolboy of the title - and despatches him to the Far East, where, amidst the corruption and decay of former colonies, a new battle is about to begin. \nDramatised by Shaun McKenna. \n\n\nClassic Serial: Smiley's People\nPart 3 of the Karla Trilogy. When a Russian ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©migrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is found murdered on Hampstead Heath, Smiley is called out of retirement to exorcise some Cold War ghosts from his clandestine past. What follows is Smiley the human being at his most vulnerable and Smiley the case officer at his most brilliant; and it takes to a thrilling conclusion his career-long, serpentine battle with the enigmatic and ruthless Russian spymaster Karla \nDramatised by Robert Forrest. \n\nClassic Serial: The Secret Pilgrim\nThe Berlin Wall is down, the Cold War is over, but the world's second oldest profession is very much alive. Smiley accepts an invitation to dine with the eager young men and women of the Circus' latest intake; and over coffee and brandy, by flickering firelight, he beguilingly offers them his personal thoughts on espionage past, present and future. In doing so, he prompts one of his former Circus colleagues into a searching examination of his own eventful secret life. \nDramatised by Robert Forrest.\n\n\nThe Complete Smiley - 01 - Call For The Dead\nThe Complete Smiley - 02 - A Murder Of Quality\nThe Complete Smiley - 03 - The Spy Who Came In From The Cold - Part 1\nThe Complete Smiley - 04 - The Spy Who Came In From The Cold - Part 2\nThe Complete Smiley - 05 - The Spy Who Came In From The Cold - Part 3\nThe Complete Smiley - 06 - The Looking Glass War - Part 1\nThe Complete Smiley - 07 - The Looking Glass War - Part 2\nThe Complete Smiley - 08 - Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - Part 1\nThe Complete Smiley - 09 - Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - Part 2\nThe Complete Smiley - 10 - Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - Part 3\nThe Complete Smiley - 11 - The Honourable Schoolboy - Part 1\nThe Complete Smiley - 12 - The Honourable Schoolboy - Part 2\nThe Complete Smiley - 13 - The Honourable Schoolboy - Part 3\nThe Complete Smiley - 14 - Smiley's People - Part 1\nThe Complete Smiley - 15 - Smiley's People - Part 2\nThe Complete Smiley - 16 - Smiley's People - Part 3\nThe Complete Smiley - 17 - The Secret Pilgrim - Part 1\nThe Complete Smiley - 18 - The Secret Pilgrim - Part 2\nThe Complete Smiley - 19 - The Secret Pilgrim - Part 3\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 25 to 90mn \nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ab04ee07b9105ccf037c3b1fe440cf1644f5939","amp;dn":"John+le+Carr%C3%83%C2%A9+-+The+Complete+Smiley+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ab04ee07b9105ccf037c3b1fe440cf1644f5939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,176,78,224,123,145,5,204,240,55,195,177,254,68,12,241,100,79,89,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
