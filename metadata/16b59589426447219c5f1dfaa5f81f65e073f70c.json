The gameplay is still very good and the teams from that time are classics now!\n\nNero CD Image, use Daemon Tools to mount. Then use the newest Dosbox to play the game. The game runs just fine.\n\nThis full cd version includes all commentary by John Motson and all game music.\n\nOne annoying thing is that you can do the rainbow kick with Alt + Enter, which also toggels full screen/windows in Dosbox. But that's the only problem.\n\nSee http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/fifa-soccer-96","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16b59589426447219c5f1dfaa5f81f65e073f70c","amp;dn":"Fifa+Soccer+96+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16b59589426447219c5f1dfaa5f81f65e073f70c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,181,149,137,66,100,71,33,156,95,29,250,165,248,31,101,224,115,247,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
