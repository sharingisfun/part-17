The original German title is simply Nachfolge (Discipleship). It is centred around an exposition of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Bonhoeffer spells out what he believes it means to follow Christ. It was first published in 1937, when the rise of the Nazi regime was underway in Germany and against this background that Bonhoeffer's theology of costly discipleship developed, which ultimately led to his death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5757b79642488c2ac833dcd6b36575975af55cda","amp;dn":"Dietrich+Bonhoeffer+-+The+Cost+of+Discipleship+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5757b79642488c2ac833dcd6b36575975af55cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,87,183,150,66,72,140,42,200,51,220,214,179,101,117,151,90,245,92,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
