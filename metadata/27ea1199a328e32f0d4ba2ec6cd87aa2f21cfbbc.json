(1993)\nBitrate: 320kbps\n\nStrictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... is the second studio album by rapper Tupac Shakur, released by Interscope Records on February 16, 1993. The rights now belong to Amaru Entertainment. N.I.G.G.A.Z. in the title is an acronym for Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished; the &quot;Z&quot; in the title makes it a plural.\n\nSimilar to his debut, 2Pacalypse Now, the album contains many tracks emphasizing 2Pac's political and social views. The album was going to be named &quot;Troublesome 21&quot;, the 21 referring to Shakur's age at the time. Debuting at number twenty-four on the Billboard 200, this album saw more commercial success than its predecessor, and there are many noticeable differences in production. While Tupac's first effort included a more underground or indie-rap-oriented sound, this album was considered his &quot;breakout&quot; album. It spawned the hits &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; and &quot;I Get Around&quot; and has since reached double platinum status.\n\nOn vinyl, Side A (tracks 1-8) was labeled the &quot;Black Side&quot; and Side B (tracks 9-16) the &quot;Dark Side.&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nAll lyrics by 2Pac, music compositions listed below.\n\nNo.\tTitle\tProducer(s)\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Holler If Ya Hear Me&quot;  \tStretch\t4:38\n2.\t&quot;Pac's Theme&quot; (Interlude)\tThe Underground Railroad\t1:56\n3.\t&quot;Point tha Finga&quot;  \tBig D The Impossible\t4:25\n4.\t&quot;Something 2 Die 4&quot; (Interlude)\t2Pac &amp; Big D The Impossible\t2:43\n5.\t&quot;Last Wordz&quot; (featuring Ice Cube &amp; Ice-T)\tBobby &quot;Bobcat&quot; Ervin, JMJ\t3:36\n6.\t&quot;Souljah's Revenge&quot;  \tBobcat\t3:16\n7.\t&quot;Peep Game&quot; (featuring Deadly Threat)\tBobcat\t4:28\n8.\t&quot;Strugglin'&quot; (featuring Live Squad)\tLive Squad (Stretch, Majesty &amp; K-Lowe)\t3:33\n9.\t&quot;Guess Who's Back&quot;  \tEdward &quot;Special Ed&quot; Archer\t3:06\n10.\t&quot;Representin' 93&quot;  \tTruman Jefferson\t3:34\n11.\t&quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot; (featuring Dave Hollister)\tDaryl &quot;DJ Daryl&quot; Anderson\t4:22\n12.\t&quot;Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z&quot; (featuring Pacific Heights)\tLarry &quot;Lay Law&quot; Goodman\t5:55\n13.\t&quot;The Streetz R Deathrow&quot; (featuring Ice Cube)\tStretch\t3:26\n14.\t&quot;I Get Around&quot; (featuring Shock G &amp; Money-B)\tThe D-Flow Production Squad\t4:19\n15.\t&quot;Papa'z Song&quot; (featuring Wycked &amp; Poppi)\tBig D The Impossible\t5:25\n16.\t&quot;5 Deadly Venomz&quot; (featuring Treach, Apache &amp; Live Squad)\tStretch\t5:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ea1199a328e32f0d4ba2ec6cd87aa2f21cfbbc","amp;dn":"2Pac+-+Strictly+4+My+N.I.G.G.A.Z.+%281993%29+-+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ea1199a328e32f0d4ba2ec6cd87aa2f21cfbbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,234,17,153,163,40,227,47,13,75,162,236,108,216,122,162,242,28,251,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
