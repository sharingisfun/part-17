It's ideal for beginners, as the layout mirrors professional apps like Adobe Premier, but is much simpler.\n\nWith Wondershare Video Editor, you simply import video and sound files into the Media window, and then drag them onto the time-line below. Here you can edit your files, adding sound, effects, trasitions between scenes and credit sequences.\n\nThe basic editing and transition tools are good in Wondershare Video Editor, allowing you to quickly and easily stitch together a video from clips. The additional tools - effects, text and intro/credit are very basic. They don't allow for much creativity, and they give you pretty cheap looking results","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56cb676665f53f540b3735caa30d1f0eb2da0b2c","amp;dn":"Wondershare+Vivideo+full+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56cb676665f53f540b3735caa30d1f0eb2da0b2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,203,103,102,101,245,63,84,11,55,53,202,163,13,31,14,178,218,11,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
