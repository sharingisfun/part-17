By this I mean that their \n\nplaying is so musical that just about anybody would tend to like it; transcending\n\neven cultural preferences.\n\n\nFYI:  Actor Billy Crystal is a nephew of the late Milt Gabler\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ccbe9180d8138f0f451f041681c8bf725420f7","amp;dn":"Teddy+Wilson+%2F+Commodore+solos+%2F+1939","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ccbe9180d8138f0f451f041681c8bf725420f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,204,190,145,128,216,19,143,15,69,31,4,22,129,200,191,114,84,32,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
