His releases of light instrumental pop and fusion also included guest stints by vocalists. Pointer moved to United Artists in 1978, and his Hold On LP had Patti Austin as the featured singer. He later included contributions from the Jones Girls and Patrice Rushen on future releases for UA, and then moved to Liberty in 1981. Pointer recorded with Norman Connors and did sessions for several other artists. He resurfaced in 1993 on a Shanachie date, Never Lose Your Heart, which would prove to be his final album; he died from a stroke on December 19, 1994 at the age of 39. \nSuccessful instrumental pop session from the electric violinist who was a dominant figure at Blue Note in the late '70s. Pointer could at times churn out a surprisingly riveting solo, but he spent more time plugging into rigidly arranged, heavily produced and orchestrated structures and supporting background vocalists. \n\n1 Phantazia \tGrusin \t5:57\n2 Night Song \tKlugh \t6:50\n3 Living for the City \tWonder \t6:36\n4 Rainstorm \tValentin \t6:48\n5 Wayfaring Stranger \tTraditional \t6:57\n6 Mirabella \tKlugh \t5:09\n7 Fiddler on the Roof \tBock, Harnick, Hines, RodneyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \t4:10\n\n\n\nBill Burks \tDesign\nDr. George Butler \tExecutive Producer, Liner Notes\nFrancisco Centeno \tBass (Electric)\nGene Cipriano \tWoodwind\nDavid Friscina \tStrings\nDavid Frisina \tStrings\nSteve Gadd \tDrums\nLawrence Gates \tAssistant\nJohn Golden \tEngineer\nPamela Goldsmith \tStrings\nJustin Gordon \tWoodwind\nDave Grusin \tArranger, Conductor, Fender Rhodes, Keyboards, Producer, Synthesizer\nJo Hansch \tAssistant\nGregory Heisler \tCover Photo, Photography\nAllan Hershman \tStrings\nDelroy Hines \tComposer\nKaren Jones \tStrings\nEarl Klugh \tGuitar, Guitar (Acoustic)\nJacob Krachmalnick \tStrings\nBernard Kundell \tStrings\nWill Lee \tBass (Electric)\nKathleen Lenski \tStrings\nRia Lewerke \tArt Direction\nJohn Lowe \tWoodwind\nEdgar Lustgarten \tStrings\nRalph MacDonald \tPercussion\nDavid Montagu \tStrings\nNoel Pointer \tViolin, Violin (Electric)\nConstance Pressman \tStrings\nLee Ritenour \tGuitar (Electric)\nWinston Rodney \tComposer\nLarry Rosen \tEngineer, Mixing, Producer\nSheldon Sanov \tStrings\nTom Scott \tWoodwind\nFrederick Seykora \tStrings\nBud Shank \tWoodwind\nMarshall Sosson \tStrings\nJohn Tropea \tGuitar, Guitar (Electric)\nIan Underwood \t?, Programming, Synthesizer, Synthesizer Programming\nDave Valentin \tFlute\nGerry Vince \tStrings\nGerald Vinci \tStrings\nRupert Willington \tComposer\nTom Wilson \tAssistant\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa020229da2032c511a647e75d1ececf8505871","amp;dn":"Noel+Pointer+-+Phantazia+%281977%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa020229da2032c511a647e75d1ececf8505871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,160,32,34,157,162,3,44,81,26,100,126,117,209,236,236,248,80,88,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
