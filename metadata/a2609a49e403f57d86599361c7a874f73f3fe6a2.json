Interesting narrative, excellent computer generated images (for its time), extensive interviews with numerous scientists (mostly Americans and Russians-thank goodness this documentary isn't biased towards any country) and a memorable soundtrack combined to make compelling viewing for anyone interested in astronomy.\n\nEven if you have no interest in astronomy, go watch it. It may change your mind. \n\n[b]The Planets - BBC Documentary[/b]\n[color=Red][i]English Subtitles included.[/i][/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2609a49e403f57d86599361c7a874f73f3fe6a2","amp;dn":"BBC+Documentary+-+The+Planets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2609a49e403f57d86599361c7a874f73f3fe6a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,96,154,73,228,3,245,125,134,89,147,97,199,168,116,247,63,63,230,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
