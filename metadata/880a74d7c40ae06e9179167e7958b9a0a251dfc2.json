They break down toxins. They plough the earth. They transform forests. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve survived two mass extinctions, including the one that wiped out the dinosaur. Not bad for a creature thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deaf, blind, and spineless. Who knew that earthworms were one of our planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important caretakers? Or that Charles Darwin devoted his last years to studying their remarkable achievements?\n\nInspired by Darwin, Amy Stewart takes us on a subterranean adventure. Witty, offbeat, charming, and ever curious, she unearths the complex web of life beneath our feet and investigates the role earthworms play in cutting-edge scienceÃ¢â‚¬â€from toxic cleanups to the study of regeneration.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880a74d7c40ae06e9179167e7958b9a0a251dfc2","amp;dn":"The+Remarkable+Achievements+of+Earthworms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880a74d7c40ae06e9179167e7958b9a0a251dfc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,10,116,215,196,10,224,110,145,121,22,126,121,88,185,160,162,81,223,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
