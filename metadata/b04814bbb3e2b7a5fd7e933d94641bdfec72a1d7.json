But returning home to Gatlin, South Carolina was just the beginning...\n\nWounded during a climactic battle, Link discovers that tending his injuries won't be as simple as visiting a doctor and that healing his arm should be the least of his worries. For being bitten by a Supernatural does more than break the skin -- it changes a person, inside and out, turning Link into someone more and more like the dark creature who injured him.\n\nIn this never-before-seen short story by New York Times bestselling authors Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, listeners witness Link's heart-racing transformation. Dream Dark is set before the much-anticipated third Beautiful Creatures novel, Beautiful Chaos, and as a special bonus includes an exclusive sneak peek at the first five chapters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04814bbb3e2b7a5fd7e933d94641bdfec72a1d7","amp;dn":"Dream+Dark+-+Kami+Garcia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04814bbb3e2b7a5fd7e933d94641bdfec72a1d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,72,20,187,179,226,183,165,253,126,147,61,148,100,27,223,236,114,161,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
