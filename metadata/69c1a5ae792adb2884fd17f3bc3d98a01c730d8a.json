He enrolls in a &quot;school&quot; that specializes in teaching one-upmanship -- the slogan is &quot;How to win without actually cheating.&quot; Through fair means and foul, Henry learns how to come out top dog in any situation, with such experts as (the real-life) Stephen Potter (Alastair Sim) as his guide. A perceptive series of comic blackouts exposing the essential hypocrisy in all walks of life, School for Scoundrels was based on the book by Potter.\n\nPlease SEED Thank you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69c1a5ae792adb2884fd17f3bc3d98a01c730d8a","amp;dn":"School+For+Scoundrels+%281960+Alastair+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69c1a5ae792adb2884fd17f3bc3d98a01c730d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,193,165,174,121,42,219,40,132,253,23,243,188,61,152,160,28,115,13,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
