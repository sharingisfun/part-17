The director's vision is illustrated in the manner of a comic strip and handed on to the crew for purposes of budgeting, design, and communication.\n\nStoryboards: Motion in Art 3/e is an in depth look at the production and business of storyboards. Using exercises, real-life examples of working in the entertainment industry, interviews with people in the industry, and sample storyboard drawing, this book will teach you how to :\n\n* Develop and Improve your boards\n* Work with directors\n* Develop your resume and your portfolio\n* Market your talent\n* Create and improve a storyboard using computers\n\nPacked full of practical industry information and examples, this book will help the reader improve their skills to either land their first assignment or advance their career.\n\nPublisher: Focal Press; 3rd edition (October 11, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0240808053\nISBN-13: 978-0240808055\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n&quot;With more than 20 years of experience in storyboarding, production designing, producing, directing, animating, a defintive book, and multiple lectures, Mark is widely regarded as one of the nation's leading storyboard artists and scholars.&quot; - Bauhaus Software\n\n&quot;Simon aims to help artists develop and improve their skills, collaborate with directors, build their resumes and portfolios and market their work. Let's not forget Simon's efforts to inform artists of the latest industry knowledge, and help them create and improve their storyboards with computers.&quot; - Bauhaus Software\n\nThe new edition of Mark Simon's Storyboards, Motion in Art is a pretty comprehensive book. Not just about animation storyboarding, it also covers live action, gaming, theme-Park boards, laser show boards and advertising storyboards, he has written 64 chapters, appendices, a preface, an intro and actually starts the book with two pages of acknowledgements that include not only names and addresses, but websites and emails too. This author does his research! This entire book is just as compreshensive and reads somewhat like a textbook with a sense of humor. Exercises are grouped at the end of the book rather than with each chapter. Everything is illustrated very well, in both B&amp;W and color. At the end are some wonderful interviews.- Libby Reed, Animation World Magazine, April 2007\nBook Description\nThe business side to the artistic side: What every storyboard artist will need to know.
