Gordon Murray, who brought you the MST3K episode Santa Claus. Featuring cheap mascot costumes, terrifying music, an utter lack of coherence and a Santa who appears to have been dead for most of the shoot, they are some of the most astounding things we have ever laid eyes on, and will quickly become a new yuletide tradition, provided your eggnog is adequately spiked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97cec974fd0792a4e587074ed1828ad048dae9bf","amp;dn":"Christmas+with+RiffTrax+-+Santa%27s+Village+of+Madness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97cec974fd0792a4e587074ed1828ad048dae9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,206,201,116,253,7,146,164,229,135,7,78,209,130,138,208,72,218,233,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
