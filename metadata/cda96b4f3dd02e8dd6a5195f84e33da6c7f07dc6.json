The band was originally made up of the only two current members, Rindy Ross (lead vocals and saxophone), her husband Marv Ross (guitars), along with Jack Charles (guitars), Rick DiGiallonardo (keyboards/synthesizers), Rich Gooch (electric bass), and Brian David Willis (drums and percussion).[1] Having a lead singer who also played the saxophone made Quarterflash notable. In a 1982 interview, Rindy Ross said that she viewed the saxophone as an extension of her voice, enabling her to express things she could not express with her voice alone. \n\n\nThe Best Of - 20th Century Masters The Millennium Collection 2006\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1 Harden My Heart 3:51 \n2 Find Another Fool 4:35 \n3 Right Kind of Love 3:49 \n4 Critical Times 5:06 \n5 Take Me to Heart 3:30 \n6 Take Another Picture 4:27 \n7 Night Shift 4:02 \n8 Eye to Eye 4:11 \n9 Talk to Me 4:58 \n10 Don't Be Lonely 2:58 \n11 Make It Shine 4:08 \n12 Walking on Ice 3:47 \n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda96b4f3dd02e8dd6a5195f84e33da6c7f07dc6","amp;dn":"Quarterflash+-+Greatest+Hits+2006+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cda96b4f3dd02e8dd6a5195f84e33da6c7f07dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,169,107,79,61,208,46,141,214,165,25,95,132,227,61,166,199,240,125,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
