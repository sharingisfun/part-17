But often they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Little Snitch allows you to intercept these unwanted connection attempts, and lets you decide how to proceed. \n\nNetwork Monitoring Redefined\nTake a look under the hood to see at a glance who talks to whom. The Little Snitch Network Monitor, which has been redesigned from ground up, raises the bar of network traffic monitoring to a new level. \nWith beautiful animations and informative diagrams it provides fine grained real time traffic information, powerful yet simple options for analyzing bandwidth, traffic totals, connectivity status and more.\n\nSilent Mode Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Decide Later\nThere are times where you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to get interrupted by any network related notifications. With Silent Mode you can quickly choose to silence all connection warnings for a while. You can then later review the Silent Mode Log to define permanent rules for connection attempts that occurred during that time. \n\nProfiles\nWith Little Snitch 3, rules can optionally be arranged in separate profiles like Ã¢â‚¬Å“HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“OfficeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“Internet CafeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Rules that are assigned to a particular profile are only effective if that profile is active. The active profile can be chosen conveniently from the status menu. \nThis allows you to quickly switch between different sets of rules depending if you are at home, at the office or connected to a public network. \n\nFirewall for incoming connections \nLittle Snitch was always great at showing when data was sent out from your computer. It reveals any outgoing network connection attempt to make sure that sensible data doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave your computer without your consent. \nWith the new inbound firewall in Little Snitch 3 you now get the same level of control for incoming connections as well. \n\nSimplified Connection Alert\nAfraid of technical terms like Ã¢â‚¬Å“TCP connectionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“http portÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? No problem. The new Detail Level preference option allows non-expert users to get just the right amount of information to make their decisions. And it only takes a single click at the Show Details button to reveal the full information and all available options.\n\nAnd so much moreÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCompatibility\nMac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion\nMac OS X 10.7 Lion\nMac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b702ec4e1bd928eb01b9455d8156a921bc7191e2","amp;dn":"LittleSnitch+3+%5BIntel%7Cincl.SN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b702ec4e1bd928eb01b9455d8156a921bc7191e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,2,236,78,27,217,40,235,1,185,69,93,129,86,169,33,188,113,145,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
