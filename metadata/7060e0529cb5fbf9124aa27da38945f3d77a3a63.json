We wanted to have fun. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy was there, ready\nwith serviceable, pumped-up swing. Their music is straight, uptempo, dance floor jazz.\n\nThere's nothing particularly original going on, but the sleazy horns and snappy\narrangements get the job done. There's nothing campy or tongue-in-cheek either; the\nmusic just barrels ahead...like good rock &amp; roll. --Steve Tignor\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.The boogie bumper                                    [03:38]\n02.Mr. pinstripe suit                                   [03:38]\n03.King of swing                                        [04:59]\n04.Minnie the moocher                                   [04:43]\n05.You &amp; me &amp; the bottle makes 3 tonight (baby)         [03:35]\n06.Jump with my baby                                    [06:10]\n07.Maddest kind of love                                 [05:04]\n08.Go daddy-O                                           [03:13]\n09.Please baby                                          [04:59]\n10.Mambo swing                                          [05:08]\n11.Jumpin' jack                                         [04:48]\n12.So long-Farewell-goodbye                             [04:35]\n________\n54:30 min\n 84,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
