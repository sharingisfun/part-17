Farrell's amazing book The Giza Death Star Deployed - The Physics and Engineering of the Great Pyramid (2003) which as a sequel to The Giza Death Star takes us from the Great Pyramid of Giza to the asteroid belt and the so-called Pyramids of Mars. The author expands on his thesis that the Great Pyramid was a chemical maser, designed as a weapon and eventually deployed with disastrous results to the solar system. This fascinating book takes us from the Giza Plateau to the so-called Pyramids of Mars, and finds evidence of a similar Death Star pyramid there. Author's theory of galactic destruction also explains the mystery of the asteroid belt. He also provides a Tesla analysis of the putative physics and engineering of the Giza Death Star, and a synopsis of scalar physics and paleophysics. Includes a discussion of quantum numerology, feedback loops and tetrahedral physics, as well. 300 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.
