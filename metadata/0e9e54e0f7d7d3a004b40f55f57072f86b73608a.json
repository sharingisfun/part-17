It tells the story of a photographer's accidental and incidental involvement with a murder. The film was inspired by the 1959 short story &quot;Las babas del diablo&quot; (i.e. &quot;The devil's drool/drivel&quot;) by Argentinian writer Julio CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡zar[1], and by the work, habits, and mannerisms of Swinging London photographer David Bailey. The film was scored by jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, although the music is mimetic as it is played on a record by the main character. Nominated for several awards at the Cannes Film Festival, Blowup won the Grand Prix.\n\nAcademy Awards\n\n* Nominated: Best Director - Michelangelo Antonioni\n* Nominated: Original Screenplay - Michelangelo Antonioni, Tonino Guerra, Edward Bond\n\n[edit] BAFTA Awards\n\n* Nominated: Best British Film - Michelangelo Antonioni\n* Nominated: Best British Art Direction (Colour) - Assheton Gorton\n* Nominated: Best British Cinematography (Colour) - Carlo Di Palma\n\n[edit] Cannes Film Festival\n\n* Won: Grand Prix (1967 Cannes Film Festival) - Michelangelo Antonioni[10]\n\n[edit] Golden Globe Awards\n\n* Nominated: Best English-Language Foreign Film\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo:\nLength: 01:51:13.58\nResolution: 720x480\nSource: DVD\nCodec: H.264 (2-Pass Encoding)\nFPS: 23.976\naspect ratio: 1.78\n\n\nAudio: aac, 48000 Hz\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnglish Subtitle :\nhttp://subscene.com/english/Blowup-Blow-Up/subtitle-249038.aspx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e9e54e0f7d7d3a004b40f55f57072f86b73608a","amp;dn":"BlowUp-%28Michelangelo+Antonioni%29_%5B+DVDRip+H.264+MKV+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e9e54e0f7d7d3a004b40f55f57072f86b73608a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,158,84,224,247,215,211,160,4,180,15,85,245,112,114,248,107,115,96,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
