Texture and surface detail is one area that is often overlooked by digital painters. By strategically implementing texture in your digital paintings, you can not only raise the quality of the image but also the level of realism. With this course weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get started by diving into PhotoshopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brushes. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how we can create and configure our own custom brushes to paint texture. From here weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to create our own patterns and several of the areas where these patterns can be utilized. Next weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll look at some ways that we can bring images into our paintings, layering them over areas to create texture with the help of blend modes. Finally, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn a few methods of making our two dimensional textures appear to wrap around the three dimensional forms of our painting. After completing this course, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be well equipped to begin experimenting with texture in your own digital paintings.\n\nTutor\nEddie Russell\n9 Lessons\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2900329414b976dd6e7cd42a7f53df7e9c5c767a","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+%26ndash%3B+Using+Texture+to+Enhance+Digital+Painting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2900329414b976dd6e7cd42a7f53df7e9c5c767a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,0,50,148,20,185,118,221,110,124,212,42,127,83,223,126,156,92,118,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
