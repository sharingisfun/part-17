Convert a regular PDF to an image. You can choose from all sorts such as BMP, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WMF and EMF.\n\nFlatten Layers, Remove Annotations, Attachments, Bookmarks and JavaScript\nPretty much exactly what you think Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ now you see Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem, now you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Maximus allows you to rid your document of all its layers, annotations, attachments, bookmarks and JavaScripts. Ahh, that feels better.\n\nCrop, Rotate, Delete, Extract and Insert Pages\nLots of fancy stuff here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if you like to get your Ã¢â‚¬Å“handsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ dirty, you can do all sorts of things with pages Ã¢â‚¬â€œ crop and swap, rotate and replace. Great if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dealing with documents that need new cover pages after theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been split.\n\nExtract Text, Images and Fonts from PDF files\nGet the most value you can from your PDFs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can extract text in plain form, in plain and preserving layout, or with font data also. You can also extract all of the embedded images into their corresponding image format. In addition you can extract all of the TrueType fonts from a PDF.\n\nFlatten PDF Forms and Extract Form Data\nExtract all of the data stored in the form fields into a CSV file. Take the form fields and the contents fields and make them part of the document. After this process has been executed it will no longer be possible to enter in new values or change the content.\n\nEdit Initial View Settings and Document Metadata\nSetup the layout, magnification and viewer preferences for PDFs when they are opened in a conforming reader. Edit the standard document metadata such as the Title, Author, Subject and Keywords.\n\nWatched Folders for Workflow Automation\nWatched Folders are a collection of folders dedicated to automating your PDF workflow. They actively monitor new files and process silently in the background independently of the main Maximus application.\n\nEasy Batch Processing\nProcess your actions on one file or on a whole collection of files with just a click on a mouse.\n\nWrite your own scripts using Debenu Quick PDF Library API\nBuilt-in Maximus features are fantastic for performing most PDF-related tasks. You can write really easy scripts to do the rest. All based on our own Debenu Quick PDF Library API of course!\n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\nDesktop\n\n    Windows XP (32-bit, 64-bit)\n    Windows Vista (32-bit, 64-bit)\n    Windows 7 (32-bit, 64-bit)\n    Windows 8 (32-bit, 64-bit)\n\nServer\n\n    Windows Server 2003 (32-bit, 64-bit)\n    Windows Server 2008 (32-bit, 64-bit)\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSharing is Caring...\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestions and Feedback are WELCOME\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like the upload, take a second to say 'Thanks'...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0853ecd8eb5de21b8f0bd170be84ec22237c822","amp;dn":"Debenu+PDF+Maximus+v1.1.0.28+Retail-SaMeep104","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0853ecd8eb5de21b8f0bd170be84ec22237c822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,133,62,205,142,181,222,33,184,240,189,23,11,232,78,194,34,55,200,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
