It's published by 2000AD and except for the covers the whole book is black and white, which is apparently the way the D.R. &amp; Quinch stories were originally published in 2000AD.  I don't have the old progs to check but I'd bet a small handful of loose change on it.\n\nAnyway, I bought this one off eBay recently and was quite surprised to find that every page is full color.  I checked it against Baytor's scan and found these additional differences:\n\nThe cover art from Baytor's book is not to be found in mine - both of the guys flipping us the finger.\n\nThe art from the back cover of his was used for the front cover of mine.\n\nBaytor's book has two cool introductory pages that mine does not have.\n\nMine has five pages that Baytor's does not have: A double page of the 1984 Inter-Galactic Tennis Tournament, a double page of Yuletide Greetings, and a single page 2000AD Star Pinup.  Like the rest of the book, all of these are full color.\n\nOther than these differences, the story pages from his and from mine are page for page identical all the way through.  Of course I had to scan this full color version.  I went with 200 dpi resulting in images about 1700 pixels wide.  I recommend you also find and snag Baytor's version to get the extra pages mine lacks and also to have the original black and while should that mood strike you.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/drandquinch1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/drandquinch1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/drandquinch2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dvdmadhouse.com/x09236wtm/drandquinch2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a75834b7946c6eb9d0cecbf286f67c73df18e9f","amp;dn":"D.R.+%26+Quinch+-+Alan+Moore+-+New+full+color+scans%2C+please+read","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a75834b7946c6eb9d0cecbf286f67c73df18e9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,117,131,75,121,70,198,235,157,12,236,191,40,111,103,199,61,241,142,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
