When Bill Minutaglio began writing for Texas newspapers in the 1970s, few large publications had more than a token number of African American journalists, and they barely acknowledged the things of lasting importance to the African American community. Though hardly the most likely reporterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as a white, Italian American transplant from New York CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for the black Texas beat, Minutaglio was drawn to the African American heritage, seeking its soul in churches, on front porches, at juke joints, and anywhere else that people would allow him into their lives. His nationally award-winning writing offered many Americans their first deeper understanding of Texas's singular, complicated African American history.\nThis eclectic collection gathers the best of Minutaglio's writing about the soul of black Texas. He profiles individuals both unknown and famous, including blues legends Lightnin' Hopkins, Amos Milburn, Robert Shaw, and Dr. Hepcat. He looks at neglected, even intentionally hidden, communities. And he wades into the musical undercurrent that touches on African Americans' joys, longings, and frustrations, and the passing of generations. Minutaglio's stories offer an understanding of the sweeping evolution of music, race, and justice in Texas. Moved forward by the musical heartbeat of the blues and defined by the long shadow of racism, the stories measure how far Texas has come . . . or still has to go.\n\nBill Minutaglio is the author of several critically acclaimed books, including biographies of President George W. Bush, Molly Ivins and Alberto Gonzales, and a narrative retelling of the greatest industrial disaster in American history. His work has appeared in The New York Times, Esquire, Newsweek, Outside, Texas Monthly, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and many other publications. His work has been featured, along with that of Ernest Hemingway, in Esquire's list of the greatest tales of survival ever written. Reviewers have compared his writing to that of Tom Wolfe, Herman Melville and Hunter Thompson, and his work has been optioned by Tom Cruise, published in China and referenced by Oliver Stone. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9164b13da5693b6ea822e1d051cae1914b704af1","amp;dn":"In+Search+of+the+Blues%28pdf%29%5Brogercc%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9164b13da5693b6ea822e1d051cae1914b704af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,100,177,61,165,105,59,110,168,34,225,208,81,202,225,145,75,112,74,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
