Lost Worlds\nDavid Attenborough tells the story of one of the most intriguing wild places on earth: Madagascar, a huge island of dramatic landscapes, where the wildlife is strange and unique. This second episode showcases an amazing collection of plants and animals, many of which have never before been filmed. Cyanide-eating lemurs, cannibalistic frogs, meat-eating plants, cryptic leaf-tailed geckos, tadpole-eating wasps, tunnel-digging chameleons and house-proud flycatchers are just some of the weird and wonderful species featured in this programme.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ytrmr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ytrmr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 1.72 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available at MVGroup)\nSource: HDTV\n\nXvid also available at MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6da2a24b397cafa8ce15808d5ca69c7cf93ba0","amp;dn":"BBC+Madagascar+2of3+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6da2a24b397cafa8ce15808d5ca69c7cf93ba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,109,162,162,75,57,124,175,168,206,21,128,141,92,166,156,124,249,59,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
