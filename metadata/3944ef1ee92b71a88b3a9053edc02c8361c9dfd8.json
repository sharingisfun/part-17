But as MIT physicist and historian David Kaiser reveals, this cutting-edge field has a surprisingly psychedelic past. How the Hippies Saved Physics introduces us to a band of freewheeling physicists who defied the imperative to Ã¢â‚¬Å“shut up and calculateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and helped to rejuvenate modern physics.\n\nIn the 1970s, amid severe cutbacks in physics funding, a small group of underemployed physicists in Berkeley decided to throw off the constraints of academia and explore the wilder side of science. Dubbing themselves the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fundamental Fysiks Group,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they pursued an unconventional, speculative approach to physics. They studied quantum theory alongside Eastern mysticism and psychic mind-reading, discussing the latest developments while lounging in hot tubs. Unlikely as it may seem, their work on BellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theorem and quantum entanglement helped pave the way for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breakthroughs in quantum information science.\n\n-----\n\nCheck also the audiobook, which wasn't uploaded by me: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8314145/David_Kaiser_-_How_the_Hippies_Saved_Physics_(2011)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8314145/David_Kaiser_-_How_the_Hippies_Saved_Physics_(2011)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3944ef1ee92b71a88b3a9053edc02c8361c9dfd8","amp;dn":"How+the+Hippies+Saved+Physics+-+David+Kaiser+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3944ef1ee92b71a88b3a9053edc02c8361c9dfd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,68,239,30,233,43,113,168,139,58,144,83,237,192,44,131,97,201,223,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
