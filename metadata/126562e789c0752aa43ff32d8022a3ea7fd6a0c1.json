In honor of the Twin Cities, Tyler gives the teams twin Truck Stops. On day one, to honor the Minnesota state fair, the teams must serve all of their menu items on a stick. On day two, the teams head into St. Paul and must make $500 selling SPAM dishes. The first team to make $500 and meet Tyler at the Peace Officers Memorial at the State Capitol building wins a huge reward, and with only four teams left, this reward could save a team from elimination and send them on to the next city.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 16-Sep-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:126562e789c0752aa43ff32d8022a3ea7fd6a0c1","amp;dn":"The.Great.Food.Truck.Race.S04E05.WS.DSR.x264-NY2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"126562e789c0752aa43ff32d8022a3ea7fd6a0c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,101,98,231,137,192,117,42,164,63,243,45,128,34,163,234,127,214,160,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
