When he's in the lab, Roberts is a brilliant NASA co-op intern, but the other interns know him better for devising thrill-seeking activities, like cliff diving and sneaking into the shuttle simulator. When he realizes that scientists consider moon rocks worthless once theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been in experiments, Roberts starts to wonderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ if theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re worthless, how could stealing them be wrong? Ben Mezrich, author of The Accidental Billionaires (which inspired the movie The Social Network), starts each section with excerpts of RobertsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s love letters to Rebecca from prison, providing a love-drunk context for RobertsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ journey as the moon rock heist balloons from idle fantasy to stark reality. Behind-the-scenes looks at NASAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Johnson Space Center and thriller-like action that ranges from the U.S. to Belgium make for an enthralling read for anyone who ever dreamed about being an astronaut-or promised to give someone else the moon.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d74d39585152b6341c1f3ee718ea7d2031a7da25","amp;dn":"Sex+on+the+Moon%3A+The+Amazing+Story+Behind+the+Most+Audacious+Hei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d74d39585152b6341c1f3ee718ea7d2031a7da25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,77,57,88,81,82,182,52,28,31,62,231,24,234,125,32,49,167,218,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
