I patched this and tested it on my PSP 1001 5.00 M33-6 and it works.  When it starts just so you know after you click the OK to auto save, push the X button to go to the main menu, or the screen will stay black.  I thought it wasn't working, but it does start up.  \n\nPlease leave comments and let me know if it works for you guys and if it doesn't let me know so I can try to fix the problem, Thanks!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:571f5695f5b737e13ea91af01a836d81e0fbc755","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+IV+Complete+Collection+Patched+%28ENG%29+%28FULL%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"571f5695f5b737e13ea91af01a836d81e0fbc755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,31,86,149,245,183,55,225,62,169,26,240,26,131,109,129,224,251,199,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
