According to the authors, three traits breed success: a superiority complex, insecurity, and impulse control. Only when this Ã¢â‚¬ËœTriple PackageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ comes together does it Ã¢â‚¬Ëœgenerate drive, grit, and systematic disproportionate group success.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Supported by statistics and original researchÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.This comprehensive, lucid sociological study balances its findings with a probing look at the downsides of the triple packageÃ¢â‚¬â€the burden of carrying a familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations, and deep insecurities that come at a psychological price.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nKirkus Reviews:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Husband and wife professors at Yale Law School explore why some cultural groups in the United States are generally more successful than others. Chua and Rubenfeld argue that each of these groups is endowed with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“triple packageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of values that together make for a potent engine driving members to high rates of successÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.[and] that the U.S. was originally a triple-package nation. However, while Americans still view their country as exceptional, in the last 30 years, the other two parts of the package have gone out the window, replaced by a popular culture that values egalitarianism, self-esteem and instant gratification, creating a vacuum for more motivated groups to fill. On a highly touchy subject, the authors tread carefully, backing their assertions with copious notes. Though coolly and cogently argued, this book is bound to be the spark for many potentially heated discussions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:922ec21892632954f2113b6bbd28b19f668b7a45","amp;dn":"Amy+Chua+-The+Triple+Package","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"922ec21892632954f2113b6bbd28b19f668b7a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,46,194,24,146,99,41,84,242,17,59,107,189,40,177,159,102,139,122,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
