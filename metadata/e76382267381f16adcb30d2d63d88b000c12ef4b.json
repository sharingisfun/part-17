She was a sickly and introverted child by her own account, but became an intellectually curious student, eventually earning a doctorate in art history at the University of Heidelberg in 1924; her first story, written under the name Antje Seghers, was published in the same year. In 1925 she married a Hungarian immigrant economist and began her writing career in earnest. By 1929 Seghers had joined the Communist Party, given birth to her first child, and received the Kleist Prize for her first novel, The Revolt of the Fisherman. Having settled in France in 1933, Seghers was forced to flee again after the 1940 Nazi invasion. With the aid of Varian Fry, Seghers, her husband, and two children sailed from Marseille to Mexico on a ship that included among its passengers Victor Serge, AndrÃƒÂ© Breton, and Claude LÃƒÂ©vi-Strauss. After the war she moved to East Berlin, where she became an emblematic figure of East German letters, actively championing the work of younger writers from her position as president of the Writers Union and publishing at a steady pace. Among SeghersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internationally regarded works are The Seventh Cross (1939; adapted for film in 1944 by MGM), one of the only World War IIÃ¢â‚¬â€œera depictions of Nazi concentration camps; the novella Excursion of the Dead Girls (1945); The Dead Stay Young (1949); and the story collection BenitoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Blue (1973).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnna SeghersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Transit is an existential, political, literary thriller that explores the agonies of boredom, the vitality of storytelling, and the plight of the exile with extraordinary compassion and insight.\n\nHaving escaped from a Nazi concentration camp in Germany in 1937, and later a camp in Rouen, the nameless twenty-seven-year-old German narrator of SeghersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s multilayered masterpiece ends up in the dusty seaport of Marseille. Along the way he is asked to deliver a letter to a man named Weidel in Paris and discovers Weidel has committed suicide, leaving behind a suitcase containing letters and the manuscript of a novel. As he makes his way to Marseille to find WeidelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s widow, the narrator assumes the identity of a refugee named Seidler, though the authorities think he is really Weidel. There in the giant waiting room of Marseille, the narrator converses with the refugees, listening to their stories over pizza and wine, while also gradually piecing together the story of Weidel, whose manuscript has shattered the narratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“deathly boredom,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bringing him to a deeper awareness of the transitory world the refugees inhabit as they wait and wait for that most precious of possessions: transit papers.\n\nThis novel, completed in 1942, is in my opinion the most beautiful Seghers has writtenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. I doubt that our post-1933 literature can point to many novels that have been written with such somnambulistic sureness and are almost flawless.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Heinrich BÃƒÂ¶ll\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* Transit - Anna Seghers,Translated from the German by Margot Bettauer Dembo ,Introduction by Peter Conrad, Afterword by Heinrich BÃƒÂ¶ll - ePUB, 280 pp\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the follwing articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_Visa_(novel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_Visa_(novel)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/transit/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/transit/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e76382267381f16adcb30d2d63d88b000c12ef4b","amp;dn":"Transit+-+Anna+Seghers+%282013%2C+NYRB+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e76382267381f16adcb30d2d63d88b000c12ef4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,99,130,38,115,129,241,106,220,179,13,45,99,216,139,0,12,18,239,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
