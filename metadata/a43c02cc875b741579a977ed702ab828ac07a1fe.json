In 1964, he released\nhis first single &quot;Everybody Do the Click&quot; (which become a hit in Philippines, at nr2 and stayed\nfor 14 weeks in TopTen Hit parade) Later, in 1965 and 1966, he also released his first albums\nThe Voice and Guitar of Jose Feliciano and A Bag Full of Soul, two folk-pop-soul albums that\nshowcased his talent on radio across the USA, where he was described as a &quot;10 finger\nwizard&quot;. He also was invited to the Newport Jazz festival in 1964.\n\nIn 1966, he went to Mar del Plata, Argentina, to perform at the Festival de Mar del Plata.\nThere, he impressed RCA Victor officials who told him to stay there to record an album in\nSpanish. They were not sure what they wanted to record, but Feliciano suggested they record\nbolero music. The result was two smash hits with the singles &quot;Poquita Fe&quot; (&quot;Little Faith&quot;,\na.k.a. &quot;Sin Fe&quot;, or &quot;Without Faith&quot;) a song written by fellow Puerto Rican Bobby CapÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³, and\n&quot;Usted&quot; (the formal way to say &quot;you&quot; in Spanish)\n\nA year later, Feliciano was due to perform in the United Kingdom, but the authorities would\nnot allow his guide dog into the country unless it was in quarantine for six months. The\nstringent quarantine measures of those days were intended to prevent the spread of rabies.\nFeliciano later wrote a song entitled &quot;No Dogs Allowed&quot;, which told the story of his first visit to\nLondon.\n\n\n\n  01 - Light My Fire                                [03:34]\n  02 - For My Love                                  [03:28]\n  03 - You're No Good                               [03:11]\n  04 - And I Love Her[Instrumental]                 [04:03]\n  05 - [There's] Always Something There to Remind Me[03:04]\n  06 - California Dreamin                           [04:07]\n  07 - Hi-Heel Sneakers                             [02:19]\n  08 - Dont Let the Sun Catch you Crying           [02:53]\n  09 - I Want to Learn a Love Song                  [04:24]\n  10 - The Windmills of Your Mind                   [03:49]\n  11 - And the Sun Will Shine                       [03:42]\n  12 - Sunny                                        [03:34]\n  13 - Stoney Heart                                 [03:42]\n  14 - Rain                                         [02:26]\n  15 - Stay With Me                                 [02:46]\n  16 - Twilight Time                                [02:25]\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 53:35\nTotal Size...........: 311.89 MB\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13745361545411549163.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/13745361545411549163.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report\n\n==== Log checksum C0C4587FD4D788977784F34F5EB1C66498D0C3D6CE7811932140D47D8F4D1C9E ====\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a43c02cc875b741579a977ed702ab828ac07a1fe","amp;dn":"Jose+Feliciano+-+And+I+Love+Her+1996+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a43c02cc875b741579a977ed702ab828ac07a1fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,60,2,204,135,91,116,21,121,169,119,237,112,42,184,40,172,7,161,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
