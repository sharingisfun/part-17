It is primarily a recruitment movie, but can also be regarded as a propaganda movie or a documentary with some light relief. Like Dive Bomber (of the same year) it is a pre-Pearl Harbor movie, made with the co-operation of the relevant branch of the US armed forces, showing off US military material to the US public, in lavish Technicolor. \n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-2A52_53269A8D.jpg[/img]\nThis material is shown in motion, both on the road and in the field; training equipment and methods are also featured. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034263/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034263/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tanks_Are_Coming_(1941)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tanks_Are_Coming_(1941)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 235mb\nDuration.... 00:20:05\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 5086kbps\nFrame Rate.... 29F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample\n\n\nREAR GUNNER(Warner Bros., April 10, 1943) Directed by Ray Enright. Starring Burgess Meredith, Ronald Reagan, Tom Neal and Dane Clark. Narrated by Knox Manning. A rousing recruitment film for the Army Air Corps w-ith Meredith as Pvt. Pee Wee Williams who goes to the Rear Gunner school and is ultimately decorated for bravery. This film is a great example of how Hollywood was part of the war effort. \n[img]http://www.freeimage.us/image-E1C8_53269A8D.jpg[/img]\nThis film manages to be both a morale booster and a recruiting film. And Burgess Meredith takes a very standard part and makes it special. We also get a brief but fascinating look at the kind of training given to US rear gunners.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036293/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036293/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 240mb\nDuration.... 00:20:29\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 640\nFrame Height.... 480\nData Rate.... 4767kbps\nFrame Rate.... 29F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\n\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074dcd5835e9222a686cadd4149dbb2811a2833d","amp;dn":"The+Tanks+Are+Coming+1941+%2B+The+Rear+Gunner+1943+DvdRips+Avi+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074dcd5835e9222a686cadd4149dbb2811a2833d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,77,205,88,53,233,34,42,104,108,173,212,20,157,187,40,17,162,131,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
