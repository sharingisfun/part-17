The woman advises him that the process could be dangerous, since she can bring the body back, but not necessarily the spirit and proposes him to listen to Haeckel's story to help in his decision. Ernst Haeckel is a cocky medical student fascinated with resuscitation. When the illness of his father becomes terminal, he travels to visit him and in his journey he meets the necromancer Montesquino, who claims to have the ability to bring the dead back to life. While preparing to spend the night nearby a cemetery, the old man Wolfram offers him shelter in his home, telling him that it would be very dangerous to stay near the necropolis. Haeckel accepts the invitation and meets his young wife Elise Wolfram. He feels seduced by the sexy woman, and sooner he finds her eternal love for her deceased husband.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/51341203787566773177.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pix2links.com/images/51341203787566773177.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/61687236663152793389.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/61687236663152793389.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/11545476829626646051.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.pix2links.com/images/11545476829626646051.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    PLEaze SEed AnD EnJoY\nhorrorhound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fe7e349ba286082a25d9f122ed00d1f69b1b33","amp;dn":"Masters+Of+Horror%3A+Haeckles+Tale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48fe7e349ba286082a25d9f122ed00d1f69b1b33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,254,126,52,155,162,134,8,42,37,217,241,34,237,0,209,246,155,27,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
