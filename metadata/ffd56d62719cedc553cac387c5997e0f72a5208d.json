A socialist, she worked for a time on the Renault assembly line and volunteered to fight against the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, a mystical vision led Weil to convert to Roman Catholicism, though she refused the sacrament of baptism. Weil fled France for the United States in 1942, where, in solidarity with the people of Occupied France, she drastically limited her intake of food, so hastening her early death from tuberculosis.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following book:\n\n* On the Abolition of All Political Parties - Simone Weil, a new translation from the French and with an introduction by Simon Leys, with a biographical essay by Czeslaw Milosz, 104 pp. (NYRB, 2014) -- ePUB\n\n===================================================================================\n\nSimone WeilÃ¢â‚¬â€philosopher, activist, mysticÃ¢â‚¬â€is one of the most uncompromising of modern spiritual masters. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“On the Abolition of All Political PartiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she challenges the foundation of the modern liberal political order, making an argument that has particular resonance today, when the apathy and anger of the people and the self-serving partisanship of the political class present a threat to democracies all over the world. Dissecting the dynamic of power and propaganda caused by party spirit, the increasing disregard for truth in favor of opinion, and the consequent corruption of education, journalism, and art, Weil forcefully makes the case that a true politics can only begin where party spirit ends.\n\nThis volume also includes an admiring portrait of Weil by the great poet Czeslaw Milosz and an essay about WeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendship with Albert Camus by the translator Simon Leys.\n\nQUOTES\nAt a time when the distrust and disenchantment Americans feel with politics runs deeper than the Mariana Trench, WeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essay Ã¢â‚¬ËœOn the Abolition of All Political PartiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ would no doubt be a best seller.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Robert Zaretsky, The New York Times\n\nWhat makes [WeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s] thought so special, so bracing and so strange, is its combination of philosophical rigour and spiritual compass.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€The Australian\n\nWeilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing is both quite strictly rational and eccentrically spiritual. Her words all but radiate moral and intellectual conviction.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Australian Book Review\n\nIt makes for fascinating, and unsettling, election-year reading.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€New Republic\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Weil&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/questionofgod/voices/weil.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wgbh/questionofgod/voices/weil.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nFor other books by Simone Weil, see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Simone%20Weil/0/99/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Simone%20Weil/0/99/0&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffd56d62719cedc553cac387c5997e0f72a5208d","amp;dn":"On+the+Abolition+of+All+Political+Parties+%28NYRB%2C+2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffd56d62719cedc553cac387c5997e0f72a5208d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,213,109,98,113,156,237,197,83,202,195,135,197,153,126,15,114,165,32,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
