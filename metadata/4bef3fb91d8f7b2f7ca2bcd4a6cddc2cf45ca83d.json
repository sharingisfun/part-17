Over one hundred power-generative movements, used to attack and defend in almost any self-defense situation, are analyzed specifically for home study. \nThis Southern Chinese Shaolin style is traditionally taught as a process of imitation for the development of power and breath control through various stylized and exaggerated postures which, in the final analysis, are honed into a sophisticated and deadly martial art.\n \nCast: Chu Chi Ling (Chiu Chi Ling)  ||  Lawrence Tan  ||  Corey Yuen Kwai (Yuen Kwei)  ||  Jung Yun  ||  Wong Wei  ||  Mak Kun Hong  ||  Jang Ling Ping  ||  John McPhail  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.529216/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.529216/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
