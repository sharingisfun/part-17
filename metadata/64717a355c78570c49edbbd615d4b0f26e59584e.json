Here we'll learn how the blocking phase is a critical part of creating levels in Unreal. After that, we'll replace that geometry with static mesh assets that will be used for the final look of our level. \n\nFrom here it just gets better because we'll learn the basics of material creation, which is one of the engine's most powerful features. Here we'll learn how to begin building up a material from scratch and use it to drive our instanced materials. Then we'll start to create the final look of our level by creating a landscape, complete with foliage, light, and particles.\n\nFinally, we'll just scratch the surface of Blueprint, Unreal Engine 4's new visual scripting interface, by creating a simple toggleable light.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1609-Introduction-to-Unreal-Engine-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/1609-Introduction-to-Unreal-Engine-4&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64717a355c78570c49edbbd615d4b0f26e59584e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Unreal+Engine+4+DigitalTutors+720p+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64717a355c78570c49edbbd615d4b0f26e59584e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,113,122,53,92,120,87,12,73,237,187,214,21,212,176,242,110,89,88,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
