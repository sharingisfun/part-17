Gathered together in this striking collector's box set is all the Arthur Conan Doyle stories and novels featuring Holmes &amp; Watson - an impressive accomplishment! The entire 48-hour series features the same expert team of directors, producers, dramatizers, and leading actors - including Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Acclaim for this work has been widespread: &quot;A remarkable undertaking - the dramatization of all 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories. Applauding them, and particularly Clive Merrison's Holmes, made my hands sore.&quot; - Peter Davalle, The Times (London).\n\nThis collection is a welcome addition to the library of any Doyle aficionado, and will provide hours of unrivaled entertainment.\n\nPresented on 64 CDs, 48 hours, and featuring a Full Cast.\n\nAll discs ripped with EAC to perfect flac, then transcoded with dBPoweramp to 192 CBR\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BBC_Radio_Sherlock_Holmes_dramatisations&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BBC_Radio_Sherlock_Holmes_dramatisations&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cadadb34add8b4900a4225d1c504b5a1d60d6a4b","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+-+Audio+Drama+-+128k+-+MP3+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cadadb34add8b4900a4225d1c504b5a1d60d6a4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,218,219,52,173,216,180,144,10,66,37,209,197,4,181,161,214,13,106,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
