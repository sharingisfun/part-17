The 10-song set is a densely layered love letter to Laredo, the spirited but often troubled Texas border town where Schwebel and Quesada grew up.\nRecorded in three sessions split up among each band memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current home city Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SchwebelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nashville, QuesadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Austin, and HallahanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Louisville Ã¢â‚¬â€œ South of Nowhere finds Spanish Gold teaming up with producer/engineer Collin Dupuis (whose previous work includes engineering albums by Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, and the Black Keys, as well as Dr. JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Grammy ward-winning Locked Down) and a cast of guest musicians including MMJ guitarist Carl Broemel, Heartless Bastards vocalist Erika Wennerstrom and bassist Jesse Ebaugh, Raconteurs drummer Patrick Keeler, Whigs bassist Timothy Deaux, Grupo Fantasma drummer/percussionist John Speice, and the entire horn section from Black Joe Lewis &amp; The Honeybears.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It can be a dangerous and violent place, and the border situation is very scary, but at the same time a lot of the people there are really hopeful and happy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Schwebel. Exploring the conflict in what Schwebel calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“feeling disillusioned or desperate about whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening around you but still trying to find some hope,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ South of Nowhere embodies both a high-charged tension and defiantly joyful mood. And in their seamless swirling-together of rock &amp; roll, soul, psychedelia, and pop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a summery, groove-heavy sound at turns inspired by Donny Hathaway, Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s rock, and early-Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s hip hop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Spanish Gold reveal the supreme musicianship and easy chemistry at the heart of their collaboration.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2412f6e58f9327c81a99ffbf95a35e84019bc8c3","amp;dn":"Spanish+Gold+-+South+of+Nowhere+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2412f6e58f9327c81a99ffbf95a35e84019bc8c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,18,246,229,143,147,39,200,26,153,255,191,149,163,94,132,1,155,200,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
