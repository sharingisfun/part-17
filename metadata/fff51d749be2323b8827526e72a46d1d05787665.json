This volume is no exception, as 1949 was the year that launched John Lee Hooker's Boogie Chillen into the world as well as Stick McGhee's immortal Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee, just two of the enduring sides to be found here. Anyone who still needs proof that the world was rockin' long before rock &amp; roll officially hit, look no further.
