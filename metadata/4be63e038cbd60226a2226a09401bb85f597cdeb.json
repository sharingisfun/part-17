While we include sufficient back-\nground and theory for you to understand the vulnerabilities that web applica-\ntions contain, our primary concern is with the tasks and techniques that you\nneed to master in order to break into them. Throughout the book, we spell out\nthe specific steps that you need to take to detect each type of vulnerability, and\nhow to exploit it to perform unauthorized actions. We also include a wealth of\nreal-world examples, derived from the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ many years of experience, illus-\ntrating how different kinds of security flaw manifest themselves in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s web\napplications.\n\nSecurity awareness is usually a two-edged sword. Just as application devel-\nopers can benefit from understanding the methods used by attackers, hackers\ncan gain from knowing how applications can effectively defend themselves. In\naddition to describing security vulnerabilities and attack techniques, we also\ndescribe in detail the countermeasures that applications can take to thwart an\nattacker. For those of you who perform penetration tests of web applications,\nthis will enable you to provide high-quality remediation advice to the owners\nof the applications you compromise.\n\nFollow us on facebook...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4be63e038cbd60226a2226a09401bb85f597cdeb","amp;dn":"Webap+hackers+handbook.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4be63e038cbd60226a2226a09401bb85f597cdeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,230,62,3,140,189,96,34,106,34,38,160,148,1,187,133,245,151,205,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
