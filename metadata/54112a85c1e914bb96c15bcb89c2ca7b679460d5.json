Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics.\n\nRussell guides the reader through his famous 1910 distinction between &quot;knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description&quot; and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel and others to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike.&gt;(wiki)\n\nopencast.de","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54112a85c1e914bb96c15bcb89c2ca7b679460d5","amp;dn":"audiobook+-+the+problems+of+philosophy+by+russell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54112a85c1e914bb96c15bcb89c2ca7b679460d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,17,42,133,193,233,20,187,150,193,91,203,137,194,202,123,103,148,96,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
