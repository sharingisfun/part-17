Other than the first volume of Batman Adventures, this was my favorite of the all-ages DC &quot;animated tie-in&quot; comics. It featured a rotating cast of stars and in its 2nd year, some fairly obscure heroes.\n\nThis torrent includes:\nADVENTURES IN THE DC UNIVERSE #1-19\nADVENTURES IN THE DC UNIVERSE ANNUAL 1 (1997)\nand as a bonus,\nBATMAN: BLACK &amp; WHITE #1\nwhich featured an 8-page Two-Face story written and drawn by Bruce Timm (and a Jim Lee cover).\n\nEnjoy and seed!  --STF\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAdventures in the DC Universe is the title of a comic book published by DC Comics. Following on from Batman Adventures and Superman Adventures, Adventures in the DC Universe used the same &quot;animated style&quot; as seen in the DC Animated Universe, but focused on a rotating cast of characters from throughout the DC Universe.\n\nMost of the characters appearing in this series had yet to be seen in any DC Animated Universe series and, as such, their designs and histories were quite different than they ended up being in their appearances in the television series, such as Justice League. For example, Kyle Rayner often appears in this series, but he appears to be far less like his animated series counterpart (who had not yet appeared on Superman: The Animated Series), and is more reflective, both visually and historically, of the character appearing in the regular DC Universe comics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9916a2f8be80662623d064a85d9a7986dbbbe67","amp;dn":"ADVENTURES+IN+THE+DC+UNIVERSE+001-019+%281997-1998%29+Complete%2C+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9916a2f8be80662623d064a85d9a7986dbbbe67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,145,106,47,139,232,6,98,98,61,6,74,133,217,167,152,109,187,190,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
