There are probably no professionally created records without tracks using this unit. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a true legend and a piece of history. The engineers that made this FET based compressor reached a level of cleverness and magic that only true visionary geniuses can achieve. While there are many revisions of this hardware, we modeled the LN version, revision E, because it's the one that has the most sonically recognized and wanted character thanks to its input transformer and class A output stage.\n\nHomepage - http://www.ikmultimedia.com/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a91f7a6602b66867df0c9f1f26b18951381cd75","amp;dn":"IK+Multimedia+T-Racks+Singles+Black+76+Limiting+Amplifier+3.5+VS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a91f7a6602b66867df0c9f1f26b18951381cd75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,145,247,166,96,43,102,134,125,240,201,241,242,107,24,149,19,129,205,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
