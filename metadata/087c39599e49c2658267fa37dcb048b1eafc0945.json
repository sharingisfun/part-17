Dont be cheap. \nThis is free and comming straight out of his pocket. Support the Auther.\n\n\nThe Redemption of Althalus is a stand-alone fantasy novel by David and Leigh Eddings. It is notable because, unlike in the vast majority of fantasy novels, the world evolves over the ages, going from a bronze-age barter economy to a more traditional high fantasy setting over the course of the work.\n\nIt primarily concerns Althalus, a professional thief enlisted by the Goddess Dweia to save the world from the depredations of her evil brother Daeva and his henchman Ghend. As with other Eddings books, it is written in a style which combines dramatic storytelling with plenty of wry humour and light relief.\n\n\n\nSeed this man ! \n\nIf you take it check back now and then to make sure its seeded well. \n\nHelp Keep it alive.\n\n\nSeed The torrent, you got it for nothing and pay every month for your \n\nInternet connection.
