Along with the dissolution of brother act Organized Konfusion, the Artifacts' 1997 split dealt a blow to the genre's vitality, and while the sound never really died, it surely went underground. Relax Relate Release, El's first full-length release in five years, puts an updated spin on many of the same B-boy themes and mad shout-outs to New Jerusalem (a.k.a. New Jersey) that made instant classics of Artifacts' tunes such as the graff-oriented &quot;Wrong Side of the Tracks.&quot; Production by the likes of new-jack indie hip-hop heroes J. Rawls and Shawn J. Period reinforce the &quot;old to the new&quot; continuum, while the appearance of Organized Konfusion's Pharoahe Monch and Prince Po (on the intriguing &quot;Frontline&quot;) brings the family full circle. --Rebecca Levine\n\nFeaturing J-live, Sadat X (Of Brand Nubian), Asheru, Shawn J Period, J Rawls (Lone Catalysts), and Ft. Prince Po &amp; Pharoahe Monche of Organized Konfusion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5df006eb4b04a28f22ae74576fd7b038d845b883","amp;dn":"El+Da+Sensei+-+Relax%2C+Relate%2C+Release+%5BMP3-192Kbps%5D+%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5df006eb4b04a28f22ae74576fd7b038d845b883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,240,6,235,75,4,162,143,34,174,116,87,111,215,176,56,216,69,184,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
