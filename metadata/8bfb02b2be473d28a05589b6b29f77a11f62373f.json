Children add and subtract coins to pay for\nlunch, they add and subtract as they share candy or cards, and they add and\nsubtract as they keep score in games. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re immersed in math activities\nevery day without even realizing it!\nThe activities in this book invite children to take their math explorations\nfurther, in ways that are just as appealing as playing a game or sharing a treat.\nWhether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lively game of Musical Math Chairs (see page 10), a math-filled\nmorning message (see page 15), or history-making math stories (see page 35),\nchildren will gain confidence in their mathematical abilities and learn important\nskills as they participate in fun, hands-on activities.\nAll of the activities support the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics\n(NCTM) standards for numbers and operations, strengthening skills and concepts\nin the following areas: understanding numbers, ways of representing numbers,\nand relationships among numbers; understanding meanings of operations and how\nthey relate to one another; computing fluently and making reasonable estimates;\nhaving number sense; estimating a reasonable result for a problem; making sense\nof numbers, problems, and results; solving problems using relationships among\noperations; and performing computations in different ways, including mental\ncalculations, estimation, and paper-and-pencil calculations.\nThough the activities are organized by addition and subtraction, most of them\nfeature interdisciplinary connections. For example, Math Magic (see page 12)\nconnects social studies and math as children learn about a puzzle that Ben\nFranklin invented 200 years ago. Math Art (see page 33) encourages art appreciation\nat the same time it involves children in practicing addition and subtraction\nskills. Hopscotch Subtraction (see page 24) integrates movement (still important at\nany age!) with math as children practice counting back. Many of these activities\nwere contributed by teachers from across the country; all of them will enrich your\nmath program and support the math standards in appealing and meaningful ways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bfb02b2be473d28a05589b6b29f77a11f62373f","amp;dn":"Addition+and+Subtraction+Activities+for+Grades+2+and+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bfb02b2be473d28a05589b6b29f77a11f62373f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,251,2,178,190,71,61,40,160,85,137,182,178,159,119,161,31,98,55,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
