The write-up for the DVD said:\n'Wilhelm Hammershoi, Anne Redpath and the four men known as the Scottish Colourists share one thing. None is as well-known as they deserve to be. What drew me to them all was my admiration and delight in their superb control of colour and their ability to use it to create a dazzling array of moods. There is an air of quiet confidence in all these artists and a determination to produce something fresh and original. They knew what they wanted and they knew it had to be special. They play with light and colour in different ways but always with consummate technical skill, making each picture an eye-opener. In these films I've tried to bring their work and their times to life. And to leave audiences wondering why they hadn't heard more about these remarkable talents.'\nUnfortunately the BBC DVD is no longer available, so these are the best I could find. Which is a pity, as the image quality could be a little better for these .avi files.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b05ad2bce8d0f223feab644e911b0cacda98f33","amp;dn":"Palin+On+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b05ad2bce8d0f223feab644e911b0cacda98f33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,5,173,43,206,141,15,34,63,234,182,68,233,17,176,202,205,169,143,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
