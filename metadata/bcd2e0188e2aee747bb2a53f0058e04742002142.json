She wakes up tied to a post in a basement, with an old woman (Sian Davis) reading from an ancient book, saying that her soul must be saved. As her father Harold (Jim McLarty) is about to light her on fire, she at first pleads for him to save her but then reveals she is possessed, her skin turning pale and eyes yellow. She is then burned to death before being shot in the head by her father.\n\nSome time later, a group of friends are meeting at an old cabin deep in the woods. Mia (Jane Levy) is attempting to detox from an opiate addiction with the support of her friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), much to Mia's surprise. Mia and David's relationship is strained due to the death of their mother. David, fearful her mental illness was genetic and that he would suffer from it, ran away from the situation while Mia had to tend to her as she died, feeding her addiction. The group is led to a secret cellar under the cabin by the smell of decaying animal carcasses. Eric finds the book, the Naturom Demonto, and despite repeated warnings scrawled within the pages of the book, utters an incantation from it. Mia begins to see images of a girl with pale skin and yellow eyes (Randal Wilson). Later, going through withdrawal, she attempts to escape the woods but is captured and raped by possessed branches, thus setting up the possession.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd2e0188e2aee747bb2a53f0058e04742002142","amp;dn":"Evil+Dead+2013.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd2e0188e2aee747bb2a53f0058e04742002142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,210,224,24,142,42,238,116,123,178,165,63,0,88,224,71,66,0,33,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
