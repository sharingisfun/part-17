Immediacy, integrity of purpose, and unqualified artistry are apparent in nearly every song. And while &quot;Fast Cars&quot; remains Chapman&amp;#039;s best-known work, &quot;Talkin&amp;#039; Bout a Revolution&quot; is that rarest breed: a song which is both topical and timeless. Any exploration into Chapman&amp;#039;s work should begin with this at times stunning effort; it&amp;#039;s a disc of remarkable uniformity and clarity that Chapman has yet to improve on.\n\nInformaciÃƒÂ³n Disco:\n?
