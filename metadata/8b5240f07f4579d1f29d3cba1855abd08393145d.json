It features all of Elvis' gospel and inspirational masters including his multi-Platinum selling original albums PEACE IN THE VALLEY, HIS HAND IN MINE, HOW GREAT THOU ART and HE TOUCHED ME as well as the gospel songs from his movies and live performances. This four disc set is remastered from the original tapes using the latest DSD technology for optimum sound quality. As with his secular music, Elvis invented his own version of gospel, drawing from every element of his vast musical knowledge - without any musical prejudice or racial barriers. I BELIEVE - THE GOSPEL MASTERS offers the most comprehensive overview of Elvis' non-secular performances and provides testament to Elvis's musical excellence and his contribution to the popularization of religious music. \n\nEvery few years brings another and different iteration of Elvis Presley's gospel recordings, and at four discs, I Believe: The Gospel Masters is the biggest ever released by RCA, including every song from his three gospel LPs and one gospel EP. That accounts for only three-quarters of the program, the other fourth consisting of sacred odds-and-ends throughout his catalog, mostly from his soundtracks or the live show Elvis on Tour, which included a five-song gospel set. Also included are three home recordings and one track from NBC-TV Special, the 1968 comeback show. Elvis' gospel work is still among the best that's ever been produced in that large and talented genre, and he excelled in virtually every setting.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc 1:\n01.
