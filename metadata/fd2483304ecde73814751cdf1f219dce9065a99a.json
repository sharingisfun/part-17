The grooves (by one of the best rhythm sections of the 90s) are infectious, the melodies clear cut and memorable and the improvisations are always inspired without going over the top. What also sets the album apart from many live-recorded albums is that the songs are not stretched out too long and with the excellent audiophile sound you directly forget that this was recorded live. (As I heard it was only recorded live in Europe - to 24 tracks with an audiophile mix being done later in the studio). Saxophonist Bill Evans proved all the qualities that his peers like Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock saw and which led them to hire him as their saxophonist in the 80s - and that he learned a lot from them regarding composition as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2483304ecde73814751cdf1f219dce9065a99a","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+-+Petite+Blonde+%28Live%29%28Eac+Flac+Cue%29%28UF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2483304ecde73814751cdf1f219dce9065a99a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,36,131,48,78,205,231,56,20,117,28,223,31,33,157,206,144,101,169,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
