Their song &quot;Buy Me a Pony&quot; was #1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 1996, and the group enjoyed success with their 2004 #1 Australian hit cover of &quot;Black Betty&quot;.\n\nThe three band members Mark Maher better known as Kram (drums/vocals), Damien Whitty or &quot;Whitt&quot; (guitar) and Janet English (bass/vocals) come from the small town Finley in southern New South Wales where they &quot;jammed&quot; (played music) together in their youth.\n\nThe band moved to Melbourne, Australia where Kram was studying at the Victorian College of the Arts School of Music. The band played its first gig at a loungeroom for a friend's party. The band soon became part of Melbourne's punk scene playing gigs at venues like the Tote Hotel in Collingwood, Victoria. They released their first single Circle K on Au-Go-Go Records with an EP titled P'tang Yang Kipper Bang Uh! (named after a Michael Apted movie) following in 1992. The band's first album Shashavaglava was released in 1992. 'Shashavaglava' means 'crazy head' in Serbo-Croatian. This album featured the songs &quot;Old Man Sam&quot; and a cover of English comedians The Goodies' song &quot;Run&quot;.\n\nThe band recorded a cover of &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; as the main theme for the movie Ghost Rider, starring Nicolas Cage. A small part of this is played during the movie, and it is played in its entirety as the first song when the movie credits roll.\n\nLineup:\nMark Maher - Vocals, Drums\nDamien Whitty - Guitar, Vocals\nJanet English - Bass Guitar, Vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74bdcf5dc273f5ad44690de27eedd4ec94d770c","amp;dn":"Spiderbait+-+Ghost+Riders+In+The+Sky+%282007%29+%5BValveryxa+Studio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74bdcf5dc273f5ad44690de27eedd4ec94d770c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,75,220,245,220,39,63,90,212,70,144,222,39,238,221,78,201,77,119,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
