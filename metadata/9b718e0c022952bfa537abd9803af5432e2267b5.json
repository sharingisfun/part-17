With the average cost of taking a child through university to age 21 now a staggering Ã‚Â£229,251, the financial strain on new parents has never been higher.\r\nA survey by ITV Tonight and parenting website Netmums has revealed that 80% of parents are having to make cutbacks to make ends meet, potentially putting a strain on their family life. Reporter Jonny Maitland went to meet the families preparing for a new baby, and those who've had to find new ways to afford the best start in life for their children. Tonight asks: what can parents do to bring down the costs?\r\nAnd is it any wonder: the costs begin before the baby has even arrived. In general parents spend around Ã‚Â£1000 preparing for their newborn. Jonny Maitland spoke to mum to be Amy who has already spent around Ã‚Â£3,000 on cots, baby grows, Moses baskets, a pram, bedding...the list goes on.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen0.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen1.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen2.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen3.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen4.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5c/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen5.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen6.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen7.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen8.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d7/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen9.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen10.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/Our-Kids-What-s-the-Cost-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3197 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 25mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 555 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.itv.com/news/2015-10-15/tonight-our-kids-whats-the-cost/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b718e0c022952bfa537abd9803af5432e2267b5","amp;dn":"ITV.Tonight.2015.Our.Kids.Whats.The.Cost.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b718e0c022952bfa537abd9803af5432e2267b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,113,142,12,2,41,82,191,165,55,171,217,128,58,245,67,46,34,103,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
