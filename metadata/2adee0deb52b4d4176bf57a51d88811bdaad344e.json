In Fiscal Hangover, Keith Fitz-Gerald analyzes the declining power of the American consumer and introduces you to the resulting investment opportunities. Without question, the American consumer and the United States government have provided the rest of the world with liquidity in the form of cheap capital and abundant debt. But in light of recent economic events, the rules of the game have changed and that means you must change with them-if you intend on securing your financial future.\n\nUnlike most of today's finance books that simply examine the end of the American Empire, Fiscal Hangover shows you how to prepare for the fall, effectively allocate your investments, and thrive in the new global economy. This book offers specific analysis and concrete actionable steps for individual investors interested in grabbing their fair share of what will be the greatest wealth creation in the history of mankind.\nExamines our current financial situation and offers practical investment advice to overcome the challenges you'll face\nAnalyzes the declining power of the American consumer and introduces you to the resulting investment opportunities\nDetails new investing benchmarks and discusses why the old ones no longer work\nExplores big picture economic issues that will affect your individual investment endeavors\n\nThe coming years may hold the greatest investment opportunities of our times, but in order to take advantage of this you'll need the insights that can only be found in Fiscal Hangover.
