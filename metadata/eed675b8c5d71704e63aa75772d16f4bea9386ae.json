This CD is over $55 at an online store. it is only $45 here please send monies to Big Papi then download will start.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy Jesse Kornbluth\nMany who profess to love the music of Van Morrison have no idea that he made a CD called 'Astral Weeks'.\n\nI can understand that. 'Astral Weeks' was released in 1968, to zero fanfare and indifferent sales. Over the years, those who heard it became evangelists for it: Elvis Costello called it &quot;the most adventurous record made in the rock medium,&quot; and Steven Van Zandt, of Bruce Springsteen's band, said that &quot;'Astral Weeks' was like a religion to us.&quot; Soon enough, it achieved cult status --- one of the most inventive and satisfying CDs ever recorded, known only to the in-crowd.\n\nI'm not a music critic --- I don't even pretend to play one on the Internet --- but it bothers me that junk sells in the zillions while quality sits alone in the corner. In 2004, it seemed to me that a web site about The Best could bring overlooked gems like 'Astral Weeks' to a larger audience. So when I launched HeadButler.com, 'Astral Weeks' was one of my first reviews --- and, soon enough, the CD became the site's poster child, its 25-words-or-less creation myth.\n\nAnd now it's back.\n'\n'Astral Weeks Live At the Hollywood Bowl' was recorded in November of 2008 before a predictably rabid audience. Morrison did not attempt to replicate the CD. That would have been impossible, for in concert he makes Dylan seem predictable. He will suddenly change words and tempo, abandon himself to a groove, call an abrupt halt --- and expect the band to read his mind.\n\nI have seen Morrison several times over the years, and each time I walk away blinking at the mystery. He looks like a squat, stout, Irish postman and acts like an ill-tempered dictator. He may not hate the audience; maybe he just likes to show us his back. But when he opens his mouth, none of that matters.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVan Morrison - Astral Weeks: Live at the Hollywood Bowl\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Van Morrison\nAlbum................: Astral Weeks: Live at the Hollywood Bowl\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2009 02 24\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 61 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
