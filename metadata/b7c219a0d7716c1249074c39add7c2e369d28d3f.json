Inspired by Ozric Tentacles, Hawkwind, Steve Hillage, and others, Hillier moved into electronica and ambient music in 1991. Working under a number of aliases, including Indigo Egg and Cyandragonfly, Hillier has used various philosophies such as raja yoga, Buddhism, and Sufism to influence his music and his approach to it also. In 2001, he released Orchid in Britain, with the album later released in North America and Asia. In 2002, he returned to the studio to record a new album as well as continue working on a longtime project entitled Harmonizing Electrified Forms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c219a0d7716c1249074c39add7c2e369d28d3f","amp;dn":"Ishq+-+Zennor+Plane+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7c219a0d7716c1249074c39add7c2e369d28d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,194,25,160,215,113,108,18,73,7,76,57,173,215,194,227,105,210,141,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
