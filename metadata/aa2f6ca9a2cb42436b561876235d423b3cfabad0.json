In part II, discussion of the theory is supplemented by chapters on the detector capabilities and search strategies, as well as an overview of the main detector components, the initial calibration procedures and physics samples and early LHC results. Part III completes the volume with a description of the physics behind Monte Carlo event generators and a broad introduction to the main statistical methods used in high energy physics.\n\nLHC Phenomenology covers all of these topics at a pedagogical level, with the aim of providing young particle physicists with the basic tools required for future work on the various LHC experiments. It will also serve as a useful reference text for those working in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2f6ca9a2cb42436b561876235d423b3cfabad0","amp;dn":"LHC+Phenomenology%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2f6ca9a2cb42436b561876235d423b3cfabad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,47,108,169,162,203,66,67,107,86,24,118,35,93,66,59,60,250,186,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
