Sadly these numbers are diminishing all the time as this power-horse is replaced by a more efficient model known as the Evolution Series. Due to stricter emissions requirements introduced in 2005, the production of the Dash 9 was replaced by the GE ES44DC.\n\nExperience one of the greatest workhorse locomotives of modern North American freight with the Dash 9 Locomotive Add-on for RailWorks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b700cb07fe395899732b20dd408b706442acf76","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+BNSF+Dash+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b700cb07fe395899732b20dd408b706442acf76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,112,12,176,127,227,149,137,151,50,178,13,212,8,183,6,68,42,207,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
