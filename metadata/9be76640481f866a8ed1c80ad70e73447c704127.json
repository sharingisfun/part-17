It was released through Season of Mist on 11 November 2011.\n\nContents\n\n\nCarbon-Based Anatomy EP is composed of six previously unheard tracks. However, the song &quot;Carbon-Based Anatomy&quot; is a reinterpretation of an older unreleased Ãƒâ€ on Spoke single, &quot;Homosapien&quot;. This was also done on Cynic's last LP, Traced In Air, as the track &quot;Integral Birth&quot; was an interpretation of Ãƒâ€ on Spoke's &quot;When Sunrise Skirts the Moor.&quot; The artwork was done by Robert Venosa, the artist who was responsible for all previous Cynic artworks. Venosa died shortly before the release of Carbon-Based Anatomy.\n\nThree of six tracks are short, ambient-oriented pieces (&quot;Amidst the Coals&quot;, &quot;Bija!&quot;, and &quot;Hieroglyph&quot;), and represent an unprecedented musical direction for Cynic. Since the two previous hired musicians, Tymon Kruidenier and Robin Zielhorst, were let go by Masvidal and Reinert, all guitar parts for this EP were recorded by Paul Masvidal. Bass parts were composed and recorded by Sean Malone, who had recorded on every Cynic release, with the exception of 2010's Re-Traced.\nTrack listing\n\n    &quot;Amidst the Coals&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:11\n    &quot;Carbon-Based Anatomy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:24\n    &quot;Bija!&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n    &quot;Box Up My Bones&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:32\n    &quot;Elves Beam Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59\n    &quot;Hieroglyph&quot; - 2:28\n\nLine-up\n\n    Paul Masvidal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, guitar synth\n    Sean Reinert Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, percussion, keyboards\n    Sean Malone Ã¢â‚¬â€œ fretless bass\n    Amy Correia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ female vocals\n    John Hiler Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mixing, engineering\n    Maor Appelbaum Ã¢â‚¬â€œ mastering engineer\n    Eric Greif - legal\nExperimental Metal?
