The film takes a keen look at a spectrum of topics like alien abduction, human/alien hybridization, the militaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reverse-engineering of alien technology and the government cover-up of anything related to extraterrestrials. Is preoccupation with E.T.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s a form of cultural madness, or is something really going on? How would E.T. contact change the religious and political institutions of our society? The Hidden Hand is full of riveting interviews with experts and experiencers alike: Whitley Strieber, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th astronaut on the moon, Paul Hellyer, a former Canadian Defence Minister, Richard Dolan, Jim Marrs, Linda Moulton Howe, Col. John Alexander, Lyn Buchanan, Clifford Stone, Nassim Haramein, David Icke, Dr. Roger Leir, Graham Hancock and Paola Harris, among others. The shadowy world of UFOs is suddenly brought to light.\n\nVisit   www.HiddenHandtheMovie.com\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“James Carman has put together one of the most original and touching portrayals of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ongoing struggle to understand the most profound mystery of our time: our interaction with the beings who are behind the UFO phenomenon Ã¢â‚¬â€ whoever and whatever they are. Artfully put together, it features many voices that have not previously been heard, and offers perspectives all of us can learn from.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-   Richard Dolan, Historian and Author of, UFOs and the National Security State Vol. I and II, and A.D. After Disclosure\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Hidden Hand, produced and directed by James Carman, is one of the best documentaries about the complex puzzle of the UFO phenomena that I have seen in my long career as a TV producer and investigative journalist.Ã‚Â­Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬Â¦  I felt encouraged that maybe 21st Century citizens beyond governments might be the truth tellers who finally crack open the Big Lie that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re alone in this universe. But I also felt the weary reality that government agencies have the countering power to keep the secret Ã¢â‚¬Å“at all costsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the public and media for their own self-survival. While we wait for government self-interest to shift to more truth, James CarmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film should be seen by everyone who wonders why politicians who love the limelight wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch the UFO mystery.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-       Linda Moulton HoweÃ‚Â­, Emmy award winning director and author of Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“James CarmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s documentary Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Hidden HandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides a sharp look at the issues behind the Ã¢â‚¬Å“embargoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ imposed by the United States and other nations on formal acknowledgement of an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race.  The film is a particularly notable for its emphasis on the experiences of contactees.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-         Stephen Bassett, Director of Paradigm Research Group\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Hidden Hand lays all the cards on the table. This film allows humanity to see the bigger picture of who and what we are as a race.  It allows us to ask greater questions that most of us have yet to contemplate:  It is not whether we are alone, but what is our cosmic role in the galactic community?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-       Alan Steinfeld, founder of NewRealities.com\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The last pole conducted here in the United States showed that 72% of the population now believes the 1947 Roswell, New Mexico event was the actual crash of an extraterrestrial craft, complete with bodies and a 60 year cover up by the United States Government. UFOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s are the second largest subject on the Internet. I suggest every single person world wide; take 80 minutes out of their daily lives and view. Ã¢â‚¬Å“THE HIDDEN HANDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. It is truly a documentary that will enlighten, and expand your view of the entire subject of UFOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Listen and learn from respected scientific investigators about the TRUTH regarding the UFO subject.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-         Dr. Roger Leir, Author of, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aliens and the ScalpelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As the old notion that we are alone in the universe falls aware and the general public begins taking the UFO issuse seriously, James CarmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Hidden HandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes its rightful place as one of the films that will bring us a better understanding of our reality and the future.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n-         Jim Marrs, author of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alien AgendaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n \n\nProduced, shot and directed by James Carman\nEdited by Dan Rovetto\nMusic by Mikael Karlsson\nNarrated by Tristan Layton\nIllustrations by Nick Danzi, Kesara, Marc Brinkerhoff and Josi Galante\nGraphics by Chocolate Media\nHip to Be a Hybrid, sung by Trystette\n\n\nNothing new in this documentary just a load of editing of what is already out there for free - worth a watch but certainly not the 12.99 price tag!\n\nenjoy and please seed!
