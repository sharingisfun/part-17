Ruthlessly groomed to take control of his clan, he has given his life to his people. But when he learns that the brother he thought was dead might still be alive, he embarks on a quest to find the truth.\r\n\r\nCatarina wants a life of freedom. But now Catarina's royal father wants to use her as a pawn to ensure a treaty between conflicting lands. So much so that he's willing to kidnap his daughter to force the issue. But when she escapes, fate throws her into the path of a man she loathes.\r\n\r\nLochlan is stunned to find the shrewish Cat being hauled away by unknown men. Unwilling to see even her suffer, he frees her only to learn that she has her own demons to fight. When their fates intertwine, two people who know nothing of trust must rely on each other, and two enemies who have vowed their eternal hatred must find common ground, or see their very lives shattered","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aabf3b1c400311da99b875d4ff746b418ffa59b","amp;dn":"Kinley+MacGregor-The+Warrior++%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aabf3b1c400311da99b875d4ff746b418ffa59b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,171,243,177,196,0,49,29,169,155,135,93,79,247,70,180,24,255,165,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
