Both offer significant contributions to atheist literature are on my must-read list. I had them digitized into PDF and included my calibre metadata.\n\nDavid Eller was born an Atheist and has never found any reason to think otherwise. He holds a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology and has conducted fieldwork among Australian Aboriginals. He has studied all of the major world religions and dozens of other traditional and tribal religions. He has concluded that an Atheist is not someone who knows too little about religion but someone who knows too much. His book &quot;From Culture to Ethnicity to Conflict&quot; deals with the problem of international ethnic conflict. Other books by Eller include &quot;Culture and the Real World&quot; and &quot;Violence and Culture.&quot; He is a regular contributor to major freethought as well as scientific journals. He teaches Cultural Anthropology in Denver, Colorado, where he lives with his wife and three cats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72853c857d769e0d5309e05f9ab47781c22a5f9","amp;dn":"David+Eller+-+Natural+Atheism+and+Atheism+Advanced","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72853c857d769e0d5309e05f9ab47781c22a5f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,40,83,200,87,215,105,224,213,48,158,5,249,171,71,120,28,34,165,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
