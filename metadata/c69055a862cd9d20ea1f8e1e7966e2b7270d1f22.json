But this account serves up more than the usual suds and foamÃ¢â‚¬â€its counsel is sound and its prose lively, and it should appeal to both wannabe industrialists and beer drinkers, not that those categories are mutually exclusive. In fact, the authors, foreign correspondent Hindy and banker Potter, decided to found their New York brewery, now 17 years in business and among the top 40 in the U.S. in sales, after consuming many bottles of Hindy's homebrew. The longtime partners tell their story in engaging, candid voices, delivering cautionary anecdotes, reflections on longstanding disagreements and lingering resentments, and brutally frank self-assessments. It helps the story immeasurably that beer is a more colorful subject than, say, spreadsheet software, a fact that gets the reader past the inevitable chapter on financing. Though Hindy and Potter may not help the aspiring entrepreneur strike gold, they offer a compelling model and a heartening story.\n\nCheers. If you like it, buy it (or at least buy their beer).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c69055a862cd9d20ea1f8e1e7966e2b7270d1f22","amp;dn":"Beer+School+-+Bottling+Success+at+the+Brooklyn+Brewery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c69055a862cd9d20ea1f8e1e7966e2b7270d1f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,144,85,168,98,205,157,32,234,31,142,30,121,102,226,183,39,13,31,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
