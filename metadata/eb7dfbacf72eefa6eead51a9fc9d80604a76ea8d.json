producing  feature  films  based  on the\n        franchise  since  1986.  Over  seventeen  feature  films  were\n        produced, including three films  based on the original  Dragon\n        Ball  anime, thirteen films based on the sequel series  Dragon\n        Ball  Z,   and  seventeenth   film  commemorating   the  tenth\n        anniversary  of  the  series.  The  films  were self-contained\n        stories  that  did not  follow  the same  continuity  as their\n        television counterpart.\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        Fourteen years after the events of the Frieza saga, the  Earth\n        is in ruins, terrorized by  a pair of Artificial Humans.  Goku\n        is long dead  of a heart  disease and shortly  after, Piccolo,\n        Vegeta, Krillin, and the other Z fighters were killed when the\n        Artificial  Humans first  arrived. Now  the only  surviving Z\n        fighter is  Gohan, who  trains Vegeta's  now 13  year-old son,\n        Trunks. Gohan  seems to  be strong  enough now  to take on one\n        Android,  but against  both, he  still has  trouble, and  when\n        Trunks always  gets in  the way,  it doesn't  get any  easier.\n        Finally, Gohan  sustains serious  injury, and  not long  after\n        he's healed, he takes on both Androids again. Gohan is  killed\n        in battle, finally giving  Trunks the necessary fuel  to reach\n        Super Saiyan. This is  the story of the  future.....that never\n        was.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;43052c312026032b36302b6d222a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7dfbacf72eefa6eead51a9fc9d80604a76ea8d","amp;dn":"Dragon.Ball.Z.The.History.Of.Trunks.1993.WS.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7dfbacf72eefa6eead51a9fc9d80604a76ea8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,125,251,172,247,46,239,166,238,173,81,169,252,157,128,96,74,118,234,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
