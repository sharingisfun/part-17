But the one thing the mean-faced, middle-aged gunman never expected to be was a man of the cloth.\n\nFunny how things work out sometimes.\n\nPosing as Brother Bernard Sebastian of the Church of Evangelical Truth, Murdock dons a clerical collar to worm his way into the good graces and confidences of the wary residents of Owen, Texas. Seems a gang of ruthless bandits is terrorizing the Texas panhandle, and all evidence points to the dusty cattle town as their base of operations. Murdock aims to unmask the gang, provided he can pass himself off as a preacher long enough to stay alive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3caf2ad89ba6a671af2871641045b54713070fd1","amp;dn":"Loren+D.++Estleman-Book+of+Murdock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3caf2ad89ba6a671af2871641045b54713070fd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,175,42,216,155,166,166,113,175,40,113,100,16,69,181,71,19,7,15,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
