From the beginning of science\nto the end of the last century, only the simplest glass apparatus\nwas known; flasks and retorts and tubes xvere used,\nand they changed very little in form through the ages.\nThen more complicated unit apparatus was introduced, such\nas all-glass condensers, multiple-nv-cked flasks, and elaborate\nautomatic extraction devices. These were standardized\nand manufactured for specialized uses, and they were rarely\naltered. Finally, the last quarter century has been marked\nby the development of custom-made glassware. Through\nclose coSperation between the workers in glass and in\nresearch, large and complicated apparatus, especially\ndesigned for the problem at hand, can be built quickly and\neasily. Rubber hose connections have given way to all-glass\naonstruction, to great advantage, and now it is usual to\nsee a laboratory almost filled with one vine-like piece of\nglass.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7a041898fc36253111bb5a4e40536903f6266f","amp;dn":"GLASSBLOWING","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7a041898fc36253111bb5a4e40536903f6266f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,122,4,24,152,252,54,37,49,17,187,90,78,64,83,105,3,246,38,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
