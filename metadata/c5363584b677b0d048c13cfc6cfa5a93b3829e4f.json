Raised in South Carolina, Beam received his bachelor's degree in art from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and later his Master of Fine Arts degree from Florida State University Film School. Although Beam would later expand his sound to include electric instruments and rich, lush textures, he was firmly exploring the former style when several of his lo-fi recordings caught the ear of Jonathan Poneman, co-owner of Sub Pop Records. The songs had been recorded in Beam's bedroom without the aid of studio flourishes, but Poneman nevertheless requested that additional material be sent to the label for submission, and Beam responded by sending two CDs in the mail -- both of them full-length albums. Poneman considered releasing them both, but instead slimmed down the set to 12 songs and released it in September 2002 as The Creek Drank the Cradle. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\nThe ongoing journey of Sam Beam from bedroom mystic to ringleader of a slick stadium indie rock band is completed on 2011ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Kiss Each Other Clean. While the previous Iron &amp; Wine album, The Shepherd's Dog, was also very produced and pro-sounding, this album is huge. Beam, a cast of many, and producer Brian Deck have embellished the songs with a ton of studio tricks, a wide variety of instruments from flute to squelchy old synths, and a tightly arranged, loosely flowing feel that anyone who was initially enraptured by BeamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early recordings might be hard-pressed to recognize. (Though BeamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice is still as haunting and intimate as ever for the most part. As is his beard.) Once you accept that I&amp;W are now as established as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ band on par with Wilco or the Flaming Lips, some questions arise. Are they still any good? Can Beam still capture a heart with a tender melody and an aching vocal despite all the tricks and sax solos? Does the musicianship on display overpower the songs? Will Beam survive in the big leagues? Most of these questions were answered in the affirmative on the last album; they are reaffirmed here. Beam still writes and sings in a voice that could penetrate even the most syrupy backing -- nothing will likely ever change that. His lyrics have the same broken and bruised poetry theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always had, only now they are surrounded by haunting and inventive arrangements that are even more intricate and interesting than on The Shepherd's Dog. This time, Beam and company bring in soft rock smoothness, dub reggae textures, and instruments that havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really been featured on previous records. The vintage synths in particular deserve mention; whether they are bubbling like mad on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMonkeys UptownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or getting Stevie Wonder-funky on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig Burned Hand,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ they give the otherwise very organic-sounding arrangements a welcome cheesy kick. Other aspects that deserve praise are Sarah SimpsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sweetly sung backing vocals and DeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production. He layers instruments and mixes sound like heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s baking a giant cake, giving the songs depth and a widescreen scope in the process. Beam couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have picked a better person for the job of blowing his music up to the large-scale work of beauty it has become. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been on board since the beginning, you have to marvel at the perfectly timed and logical way the music has progressed. No one could ever accuse Beam of selling out his art, only growing up and building it up. Kiss Each Other Clean is the result of years of growth and change, and though that sounds incredibly boring, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also a record full of roiling emotion, tender wit, and deeply felt melodic beauty. In other words, a standard issue Iron &amp; Wine record.\n\n\n01.Walking Far From Home\n02.Me And Lazarus\n03.Tree By The River\n04.Monkeys Uptown\n05.Half Moon\n06.Rabbit Will Run\n07.Godless Brother In Love\n08.Big Burned Hand\n09.Glad Man Singing\n10.Your Fake Name Is Good Enough For Me\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5363584b677b0d048c13cfc6cfa5a93b3829e4f","amp;dn":"Iron+%26+Wine+-+Kiss+Each+Other+Clean+%282011%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5363584b677b0d048c13cfc6cfa5a93b3829e4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,54,53,132,182,119,176,208,72,193,60,252,108,250,90,147,179,130,158,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
