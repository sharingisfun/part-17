As far as phrase books go, it contains much less information than any regular sized phrase book. As such, it may be most suitable for someone who knows no Chinese and would like to learn just a few expressions.\n\nOn the other hand, this booklet does include few slang expressions, some insults, dating and sex-related language which you won't find in a regular phrase book.\n\nAll words / expressions are written in English, in Chinese simplified characters, and in pinyin. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a5889ca00a6e683d49dfcfaefc90b151ee55d98","amp;dn":"Making+Out+In+Chinese+%28Mandarin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a5889ca00a6e683d49dfcfaefc90b151ee55d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,88,137,202,0,166,230,131,212,157,252,250,239,201,11,21,30,229,93,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
