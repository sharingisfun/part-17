All\nthis, coupled with UnkleÃƒï¿½Ã‚Â¢s trademark electronica is expertly woven and\nlayered to build rich sound-scapes. Where Did The Night Fall takes\nthe listener on another exciting musical journey.\n\nOnce again we see Unkle joined by a host of guest vocalists including\ngravelly voiced legend Mark Lanegan, formerly of Queens of the Stone\nAge and Screaming Trees; San Francisco psych scene darlings Sleepy Sun;\nTexan based drone rockers The Black Angels; and Katrina Ford of cabaret\npunk trio Celebration and long time TV On The Radio collaborator.\n\nAlso returning to the fold are tracks with Joel Cadbury, former South\nfrontman; Gavin Clark, former Clayhill frontman; ELLE J of dark\nfolk-rock group Dark Horses; and, Los Angeles based art noise-pop trio\nAutolux.\n\nUnkle Live toured the world in 2007 and 2008 and will return to the\nstage in 2010 starting with select shows.
