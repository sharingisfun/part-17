His dream: to build the first cos-continental railway... and nothing will stand in his way! Not even the quiet town of Paradise, home of the sherrif oft called a wonder woman, Diana Prince. \n\nTo avenge those crushed under the iron wheel's of Lord's ambition, Diana travels high and low gathering a posse of heroes for her cause including Kid Flash, the fastest gun in the West, Katar Johnson, the Hawk Shaman, John Jones, the mysterious manhunter, with Booster Gold and the Beetle- a maverick gambler and a radical inventer. \n\nAs they pick up Maxwell's trail, they're beset by mechanical men and chased by the Pinkerton, Guy Gardner. In the final show down, Felix Faust reveals Maxwell Lord's iron steam machine... a giant metal monster who breaths flames, much to the chagrin of the manhunter Jones. Nevertheless, the heroes win, discover a captured Dominator who gave Lord his technological edge, and drive off Guy for the time being. \n\nIn the epilogue, the Beetle recounts his story to Colonel Kent, veteran and journalist who spreads the tale of the Justice Riders.&quot;\n\nThanks to Son of Ultron-Empire for this great digital copy.
