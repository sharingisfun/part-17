J. Clark rewrites the history of modern art. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, he explains, the project called socialism may have come to an end at roughly the same moment as modernism. Did modernism and socialism depend on each other for their vitalityÃ¢â‚¬â€for their sense of the future and their wish to live in a fully material world? Have they died? Aware of modernismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foibles and blind spots, but passionately attached to the movementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wildness, Clark poses these fundamental questions in Farewell to an Idea. \n\nPS Usable but not very best of scan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae5dcd4a797f72840b1743790fd24bba35129038","amp;dn":"Farewell+to+an+Idea+-+Episodes+from+A+History+of+Modernism+%28Art+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae5dcd4a797f72840b1743790fd24bba35129038","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,93,205,74,121,127,114,132,11,23,67,121,15,210,75,186,53,18,144,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
