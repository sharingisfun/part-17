Cole had spent some time bringing the whole Drake, Wale, and Big Sean style to a more street level. Its worth mentioning because Cole World: The Sideline Story has little of that debut desire to cross over, and while the multi-talented Cole is a skilled, interesting beat-maker in his own right, a superstar production would have certainly made this album more approachable. Coles fantastic style shoots off bold punch lines one minute (I blow brains, Cobain-style) and then goes deep the next, with equal skill and all while stringing together eye-level, real-life stories that have that classic flow. The reservation count is high and the flaw count is zero, and in this case, thats the proper formula for a rich hip-hop album. Take a couple listens, let it sink in, and then discover that Cole World is one hell of a debut.\n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rap\nStyle: Hardcore Rap\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44,100 Hz\nBit Rate: ~900 kbps\nBits per Sample: 16\nCovers: Front\n\nTracks:\n\n 1.
