Now, years later, Jack is a changed man, with a head full of secrets driving him insane. His recent record of police brutality and a reputation for not following the rules has prompted his seniors to give him an ultimatum: take a few weeks off, relax, and find some way to let go of all the anger Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or else find another job.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why Jack is about to board The Spirit of Kirkpatrick, a cruise liner built for relaxation and fun. Pretty soon, however, Jack realises that a little R&amp;R is the last thing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever going to get aboard the cursed ship. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a virus onboard, making people insane and bleeding from the eyes. The whole ship is overrun with blood and death, and there is nowhere to escape.\n\nJust when Jack thinks his number is up and his life is over, he wakes up. The day is exactly the same. In fact, everything is the same. Jack is forced to witness the viral outbreak again and again as it ravages the ship and its passengers over and over, day after day. Jack finds himself trapped in a repeating hell.\n\nIt wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be long before Jack realises there are others onboard just like him Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that some of them know more than theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re letting on.\n\nepub and mobi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb8334579ae63e4c23906defb2988442a0e1088","amp;dn":"Sea+Sick+By+Iain+Rob+Wright","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb8334579ae63e4c23906defb2988442a0e1088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,184,51,69,121,174,99,228,194,57,6,222,251,41,136,68,42,14,16,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
