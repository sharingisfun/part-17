After our trial and test, the software is proved to be official, secure and free. Here is the official description for ManageEngine PasswordManager Pro: Password MANAGER Pro (PMP) is a trusted solution to securely store, access and administer shared administrative passwords. It enables IT managers to maintain a central repository of passwords, enforce standard password policies and control unauthorized user access to shared passwords. It also provides a complete record of Ã¢â‚¬ËœwhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœwhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœwhenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of password access. In organizations, access to IT infrastructure such as servers, databases, network devices and applications storing sensitive data are restricted through privileged passwords. The number of administrative passwords keep on growing as more and more servers, devices and applications are added to the enterprise. Typically, the applications are used in a shared environment by a group of administrators, who end up virtually struggling with a pile of passwords and face problems on securely storing, managing and sharing the passwords. Spreadsheets, flat files and even print-outs containing the passwords are circulated among the administrators.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img.rlsbb.com/images/fyNSrbJhX.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img.rlsbb.com/images/fyNSrbJhX.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeatures:-\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Centralized Password Vault\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shared Password Management\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ AD &amp; LDAP Integration\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Remote Password Reset\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Password Access Control Workflow\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Password Security &amp; Compliance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A-to-A Password Management\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Automatic Login to Systems\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Audit &amp; Notifications\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Two Factor Authentication\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Shared administrative password management\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Service accounts password management (Application-to-Application / Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Application-to-Database)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Active Directory/LDAP integration\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Role-based access control &amp; user groups\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Password Access Control Workflow\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Password ownership &amp; sharing\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Automated password resets\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Automatic login to target systems, websites\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Real-time notifications for password events\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Two-Factor Authentication\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Comprehensive audit trails and reporting\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ PCI DSS compliance reporting\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ High availability architecture for uninterrupted access to passwords","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8af2ed2a5a384c60c9ff1de0a27322cbf046c65","amp;dn":"Zoho+ManageEngine+PasswordManager+Pro+v7.0.0.7001+%7BB%40tman%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8af2ed2a5a384c60c9ff1de0a27322cbf046c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,175,46,210,165,163,132,198,12,159,241,222,10,39,50,44,191,4,108,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
