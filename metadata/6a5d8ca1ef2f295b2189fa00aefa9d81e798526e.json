In this course I'll explore how to build end to end SPA \nsolutions using data binding and MVVM on the client, data services for abstracted calls, navigation and \nrouting, responsive design for mobility, and local storage. On the server, we will explore layered patterns, \nASP.NET Web API for RESTful services returning JSON, and Entity Framework Code First for data access. \n \n================================================\n\nEnjoy it and seed as long as you can.. ;)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a5d8ca1ef2f295b2189fa00aefa9d81e798526e","amp;dn":"Pluralsight.net+-+Single+Page+Apps+With+HTML5+Web+API+Knockout+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a5d8ca1ef2f295b2189fa00aefa9d81e798526e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,93,140,161,239,47,41,91,33,137,250,0,174,250,157,129,231,152,82,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
