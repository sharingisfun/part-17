The directors of this film, Haskell Wexler and Saul Landau, went to Chile and recorded first-hand interviews with the former prisoners, revealing the torture that was part of everyday routine interrogation in Brazilian prisons. The film shows reenactments of waterboarding, pau de arara and other medieval and modern &quot;procedures&quot; administered by Brazil's military government.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a4edede9b5178364bac3355e6d2740cd84b2fac","amp;dn":"Brazil%3A+A+Report+on+Torture+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a4edede9b5178364bac3355e6d2740cd84b2fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,78,222,222,155,81,120,54,75,172,51,85,230,210,116,12,216,75,47,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
