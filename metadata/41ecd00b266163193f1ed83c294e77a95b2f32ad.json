From search engines to flirting strategies, from the value of institutional stupidity to the malicious minutiae of databases, this book shows how the devil is in the details.\n\n The title takes the imperative &quot;Don't be evil&quot; and asks, what would be done any differently in contemporary computational and networked media were that maxim reversed.\n\n Media here are about much more and much less than symbols, stories, information, or communication: media do things. They incite and provoke, twist and bend, leak and manage. In a series of provocative stratagems designed to be used, Evil Media sets its reader an ethical challenge: either remain a transparent intermediary in the networks and chains of communicative power or become oneself an active, transformative medium.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ecd00b266163193f1ed83c294e77a95b2f32ad","amp;dn":"Evil+Media+%282012%29+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ecd00b266163193f1ed83c294e77a95b2f32ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,236,208,11,38,97,99,25,63,30,216,60,41,78,119,169,91,47,50,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
