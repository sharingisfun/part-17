When this counter reads somewhere between 7000 to 7500 the printer will stop working so i used the resetter for tx 110.  I was able to use my printer with several resets till the mechanical parts of the printer reach its maximum usability.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18dc099631c6b8d8f27999397c99b8a8c008afea","amp;dn":"epson+resetter+for+ME320-TX121","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18dc099631c6b8d8f27999397c99b8a8c008afea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,220,9,150,49,198,184,216,242,121,153,57,124,153,184,168,192,8,175,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
