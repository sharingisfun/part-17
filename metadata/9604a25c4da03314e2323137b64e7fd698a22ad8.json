It introduced the features &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; and &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, and was a showcase for the science fiction/suspense stories of artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, and for the groundbreaking work of writer-artist Jim Steranko.\n\nThe Marvel Comics series ran 168 issues, cover-dated June 1951 to May 1968.[1] It began as a horror anthology from the company's 1950s precursor, Atlas Comics. Initially modeled after the gory morality tales of the popular and groundbreaking EC line of comics,[2] Strange Tales became less outrÃƒÂ© with the 1954 imposition of the Comics Code, which prohibited graphic horror, as well as vampires, zombies and other classical monsters.\n\nThe anthology switched to superheroes during the Silver Age of Comic Books, retaining the sci-fi, suspense and monsters as backup features for a time. Strange Tales' first superhero, in 12- to 14-page stories, was the Fantastic Four's Human Torch, Johnny Storm, beginning in #101 (October 1962). The Fantastic Four made occasional cameo appearances, and the Thing became a co-star with #123 (August 1964). Strange Tales Annual #2 (1963) featured the first team-up of Spider-Man and the Human Torch.\n\nThe title became a &quot;split book&quot; with the introduction of sorcerer Doctor Strange, by Lee and artist Steve Ditko. This 9- to 10-page feature debuted in #110 (July 1963),[11] and after an additional story and then skipping two issues returned permanently with #114. \n\nThe Human Torch and Thing were replaced in #135 (August 1965) by Nick Fury, a superspy in keeping with the concurrent James Bond/The Man from U.N.C.L.E. craze. The 12-page feature was initially by Lee and Kirby, with the latter supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the Helicarrier\n\nStrange Tales temporarily ended with #168 (May 1968). The following month, Doctor Strange's adventures continued in the full-length Doctor Strange #169,[21] with Nick Fury moving to the newly launched Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nFour years later, Strange Tales resumed at its old numbering with #169 (September 1973),[22] which introduced the supernatural feature Brother Voodoo by writer Len Wein and artist Gene Colan. The next feature was writer-artist-colorist Jim Starlin's take on Adam Warlock, picking up the character from the 1972-73 series Warlock (a.k.a. The Power of Warlock) and reviving him in Strange Tales #178 (Feb. 1975). After issue #181 (Aug. 1975), the story would continue in Warlock #9 (October 1975), picking up from the old series' numbering. Strange Tales soldiered on with Doctor Strange reprints through issue #188 (November 1976)\n\n\nI wasn't able to find issue 49.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9604a25c4da03314e2323137b64e7fd698a22ad8","amp;dn":"Strange+Tales+%28issues+1-188%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9604a25c4da03314e2323137b64e7fd698a22ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,4,162,92,77,160,51,20,226,50,49,55,182,78,127,214,152,162,42,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
