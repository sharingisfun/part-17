Young's body of work ranks second only to Bob Dylan in terms of depth, and he was able to sustain his critical reputation, as well as record sales, for a longer period of time than Dylan, partially because of his willfully perverse work ethic. From the beginning of his solo career in the late '60s through to the 21st century, he never stopped writing, recording, and performing; his official catalog only represented a portion of his work, since he kept countless tapes of unreleased songs in his vaults.\n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nYear.................: 2002\nQuality..............: DVD-A 24Bit-96kHz Stereo {FLAC]\nIncluded.............: Front Cover\n\n\n\n01.Out On The Weekend\n02.Harvest\n03.A Man Needs A Maid\n04.Heart Of Gold\n05.Are You Ready For The Country\n06.Old Man\n07.There's A World\n08.Alabama\n09.The Needle And The Damage Done\n10.Words (Between The Lines Of Age)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4715e3948ec7a28c8e43f1f8cbecf0c47ac7ec","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Harvest+%5BDVD-A+24Bit-96kHz+Stereo%5D+%282002%29+%7BFLAC%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4715e3948ec7a28c8e43f1f8cbecf0c47ac7ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,71,21,227,148,142,199,162,140,142,67,241,248,203,236,240,196,122,199,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
