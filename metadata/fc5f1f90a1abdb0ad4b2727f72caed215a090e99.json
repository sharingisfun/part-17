Hope it's useful.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/system_shock_2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/gamecard/system_shock_2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTorrent has\n-SS2Tool5.0 and its necessary offline install files ready for installation\n-Various Mods to improve the look of the game and some minor bugfixing\n\nMods included are :\n+SHTUP- Replaces a bunch of common and not so common objects textures. \n+Four Hundred- Ups the resolution of world textures while remaining faithful to the original. \n+Vurt's Space- Remember how pretty space is? Well now you won't forget. \n+SHMUP- Increases the quality of the music. How? I dunno a wizard did it. \n+Updated Bindings - Not really a mod but applies some more modern bindings to the game.\n+Rebirth- Makes many NPCs not look like ass. \n+ADaoB Anomalies, Discrepancies and outright Bugs- General bugfixing mod, but attempts to stay true to the intention of the developers \n+Vurt's Space with Earth - alternate version of the hires space mod, but requires ADaoB posted directly above.\n+Tacticool- Makes your rooty tooty point and shooty weapons purtier. \n+Cutscene Rebirth- Increases the resolution of the intro cutscene, where Goggles wakes up from cryo.\n\nThese mods don't really change the nature of the game - they try to keep it as true to original form as possible.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThank you very much to all the modders who spent their time improving and working with SS2. I very much appreciate it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc5f1f90a1abdb0ad4b2727f72caed215a090e99","amp;dn":"System+Shock+2+easy+install+mods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc5f1f90a1abdb0ad4b2727f72caed215a090e99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,95,31,144,161,171,219,10,212,178,114,127,114,202,237,33,90,9,14,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
