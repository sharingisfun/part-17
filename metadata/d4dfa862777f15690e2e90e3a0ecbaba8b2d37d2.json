I found one patched for the first puzzle, but then one of the final doors' puzzles would freeze as well. I looked all over and couldn't find a patched version, and so I made one myself.\n\nFULLY PATCHED.\n\n\n\n\n**No freezing on any puzzle **\n\n\nI played through the game two times on different &quot;patched&quot; versions... with the game freezing on one of the last doors. \n\n\nI patched it myself and it works through every door, puzzle and ending. 100%\n\n\nThis goes without saying, but you need a flashcart to play downloaded games like this on the DSTWO or R4 card. If you don't know how to put games onto one of these devices, use google.\n\n\n\nThis torrent is years too late, and so it's likely going to be hard to find for latecomers to the game. Please seed.\n\n\nThis is my first upload, and so I hope you enjoy.\n\n\n\n\nRenegade Deer\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4dfa862777f15690e2e90e3a0ecbaba8b2d37d2","amp;dn":"999+9+Hours+9+Persons+9+Doors+%28U%29--+FULLY+PATCHED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4dfa862777f15690e2e90e3a0ecbaba8b2d37d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,223,168,98,119,127,21,105,14,46,144,227,160,236,186,186,139,45,55,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
