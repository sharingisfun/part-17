In this comprehensive rejoinder, Neil Davidson seeks to answer the question, How revolutionary were the bourgeois revolutions? by systematically examining the approach taken by a wide range of thinkers to explain their causes, outcomes, and content across the historical period from the sixteenth-century Reformation to twentieth-century decolonization. Through far-reaching research and comprehensive analysis, Davidson demonstrates that there is much at stakeÃ¢â‚¬â€far from being a stale issue for the history books, understanding these struggles of the past can offer insightful lessons for todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s radicals.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d42a053e9eb88f48dded272e8bb5c40c5e8f3f4","amp;dn":"How+Revolutionary+Were+the+Bourgeois+Revolutions%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d42a053e9eb88f48dded272e8bb5c40c5e8f3f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,66,160,83,233,235,136,244,141,222,210,114,232,187,92,64,197,232,243,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
