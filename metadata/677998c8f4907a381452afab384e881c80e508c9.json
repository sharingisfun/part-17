Based on 20 years of teaching by the leading researcher in graph theory, it offers a solid foundation on the subject. This revised and augmented edition features new exercises, simplifications, and other improvements suggested by classroom users and reviewers. Topics include basic graph theory, colorings of graphs, circuits and cycles, labeling graphs, drawings of graphs, measurements of closeness to planarity, graphs on surfaces, and applications and algorithms.\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:677998c8f4907a381452afab384e881c80e508c9","amp;dn":"Pearls+in+Graph+Theory%3A+A+Comprehensive+Introduction.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"677998c8f4907a381452afab384e881c80e508c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,121,152,200,244,144,122,56,20,82,175,171,56,78,136,28,128,229,8,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
