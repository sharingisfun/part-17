The bands most popular \nrelease, Synchronicity includes the hit songs &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; &quot;King of Pain&quot; \n&quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot; and &quot;Synchronicity II&quot;.\n\nThe album's title was inspired by Arthur Koestler's The Roots of Coincidence, which mentions Carl Jungs \ntheory of synchronicity. Sting was an avid reader of Koestler, and also named Ghost in the Machine after \none of his works.\n\nThe album marked a significant reduction in the reggae influences that were a part of the band's first \nfour records, instead featuring production-heavy textures and liberal use of synthesizers that, at times, \ndrove entire songs (&quot;Synchronicity I&quot; &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger&quot;) The influence of World music can also \nbe heard in songs such as &quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot; and &quot;Walking in Your Footsteps&quot;.\n\nAs with their prior album, the basic tracks for Synchronicity were recorded at AIR Studios, Montserrat. For \nsound engineering reasons, the three band members recorded their parts in separate rooms: Copeland with his \ndrums in the dining room, Sting in the control room, and Summers in the actual studio. According to \nco-producer Hugh Padgham, subsequent overdubs were done with only one member in the studio at a time.\n\n\n   1. The Police - Synchronicity I                            [03:26]\n   2.
