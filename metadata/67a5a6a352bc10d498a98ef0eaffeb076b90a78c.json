The actual historical record, however, has until now remained disturbingly incomplete.\n\nWhat chemicals was the Army studying?\nWhy was the program never fully documented in books available to the public?\nWho planned and carried out the tests, and what was their purpose?\nHow, and by whom, were the volunteers recruited?\nHow adequately were they instructed before giving their informed consent?\nWhat long range effects, if any, have been found in follow-up studies? \n\nWritten by the physician who played a pivotal role in the psychoactive drug testing of hundreds of volunteers, the story breaks an official silence that has lasted almost fifty years. Dr. James Ketchum may be the only scientist still equal to the task. His book goes a long way toward revealing the contents of once classified documents that still reside in restricted archives. \n\nThe author spent most of a decade testing over a dozen potential incapacitating agents including, LSD, BZ and marijuana derivatives.  His 380-page narrative, is loaded with both old and recent photographs, and derives from technical reports, memoranda, films, notes and memories.  The book is written primarily for the general reader, but is supplemented by a voluminous appendix of graphs and tables for the technically inclined. Dr. KetchumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book combines a subjective diary with an objective report of the external events that shaped and eventually terminated the program.  Informal and autobiographical in style, it includes numerous amusing anecdotes and personality portraits that make it simultaneously intriguing and informative.&quot;\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world&amp;#039;s longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67a5a6a352bc10d498a98ef0eaffeb076b90a78c","amp;dn":"Chemical+Warfare+Secrets+Almost+Forgotten","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67a5a6a352bc10d498a98ef0eaffeb076b90a78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,165,166,163,82,188,16,212,152,169,142,240,234,255,235,7,107,144,167,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
