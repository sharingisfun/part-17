Sanborn does not get all that far away from the themes (which include &quot;Try a Little Tenderness,&quot; &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,&quot; &quot;For All We Know,&quot; &quot;This Masquerade&quot; and a very emotional &quot;Everything Must Change&quot; in addition to a few newer songs) but his sound is so soulful and full of passion that he does not really need to improvise much to make his point. It's a fine change of pace for the highly influential altoist. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86817df702a8cd5c5675b981e2f399f5f48666a2","amp;dn":"David+Sanborn+-+Pearls+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86817df702a8cd5c5675b981e2f399f5f48666a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,129,125,247,2,168,205,92,86,117,185,129,226,243,153,245,244,134,102,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
