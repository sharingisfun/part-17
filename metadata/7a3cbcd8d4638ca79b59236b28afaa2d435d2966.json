D. Laing (Author)\n\n\nThis is the most profound book I ever read. Laing defines mental illness as an ontological crisis with the potential to be a spiritual breakthrough. He decries psychiatry for perversely thwarting this potential with various forms of torture (incarceration, drugs, electroshock, etc.) As to normality, Laing argues it is the product of a pathological &quot;us and them&quot; mentality underlying personal identity and group dynamics.\n\nTo be well-adjusted to our modern dysfunctional society is not healthy for the individual or society. Who is more dangerous? Laing asks: the psychotic who mistakenly believes he carries a hydrogen bomb in his stomach or the perfectly adjusted B-52 bomber pilot who will drop very real hydrogen bombs when ordered to do so?\n\nThe chapter titled &quot;The Bird of Paradise&quot; is hypnotically poignant in exploring the inner world of thoughts and emotions. Laing was much more than a scientist. He was a visionary who shed light on the dark role of psychiatrists as voodoo-like priests and purveyors of social engineering.\nBy William Starr Moake on March 14, 2003\n\nISBN: 039471475X \nISBN13: 9780394714752","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a3cbcd8d4638ca79b59236b28afaa2d435d2966","amp;dn":"R.+D.+Laing+-+1990+-+Politics+of+Experience+and+the+Bird+of+Para","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a3cbcd8d4638ca79b59236b28afaa2d435d2966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,60,188,216,212,99,140,167,155,89,35,107,40,175,170,45,67,93,41,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
