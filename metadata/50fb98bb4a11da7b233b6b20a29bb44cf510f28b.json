At its public launch in 2004 Mozilla Firefox was the first browser to challenge Microsoft Internet ExplorerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dominance. Since then, Mozilla Firefox has consistently featured in the top 3 most popular browsers globally and this is set to continue thanks to the release of Firefox 30. The key features that have made Mozilla Firefox so popular are the simple and effective UI, browser speed and strong security capabilities. The browser is particularly popular with developers thanks to its open source development and active community of advanced users.\n\nEasier Browsing\n\nMozilla put of a lot of resources into creating a simple but effective UI aimed at making browsing quicker and easier. They created the tab structure that has been adopted by most other browsers. In recent years Mozilla has also focused on maximizing browsing area by simplifying toolbar controls to just a Firefox button (which contains settings and options) and back/forward buttons. The URL box features direct Google searching as well as an auto predict/history feature called Awesome Bar. On the right side of the URL box there are bookmarking, history and refresh buttons. To the right of the URL box is a search box which allows you to customize your search engine options. Outside of that a view button controls what you see below the URL. Next to that you have the download history and home buttons.\n\nSpeed\n\nMozilla Firefox boasts impressive page load speeds thanks to the excellent JagerMonkey JavaScript engine. Start up speed and graphics rendering are also among the quickest in the market. Firefox manages complex video and web content using layer-based Direct2D and Driect3D graphics systems. Crash protection ensures only the plugin causing the issue stops working, not the rest of the content being browsed. Reloading the page restarts any affected plugins. The tab system and Awesome Bar have been streamlined to launch/get results very quickly too.\n\nSecurity\n\nFirefox was the first browser to introduce a private browsing feature which allows you to use the internet more anonymously and securely. History, searches, passwords, downloads, cookies and cached content are all removed on shutdown. Minimizing the chances of another user stealing your identity or finding confidential information. Content security, anti-phishing technology and antivirus/antimalware integration ensures your browsing experience is as safe as possible.\n\nPersonalisation &amp; Development\n\nOne of the best features of the Firefox UI is customization. Simply right click on the navigation toolbar to customize individual components or just drag and drop items you want to move around. The inbuilt Firefox Add-ons Manager allows you to discover and install add-ons within the browser as well as view ratings, recommendations and descriptions.

Site authors and developers can create advanced content and applications using MozillaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s open source platform and enhanced API.\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Firefox 33.0\nFilename: Firefox Setup 33.0.exe\nFile size: 34.76MB (36,448,072 bytes)\nRequirements: Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / Windows7 / XP64 / Vista64 / Windows7 64 / Windows8 / Windows8 64\nLanguages: Multiple languages\nLicense: Open Source\nDate added: October 15, 2014\nAuthor: Mozilla Organization\nwww.mozilla.org\nHomepage: www.mozilla.com/firefox/\nMD5 Checksum: 356414F30B9A8F8756E68CB2482FF5C5\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED AND SHARE.
