We learn about ancient devices for arithmetic and about modern explanations of artificial intelligence. There are feasts here for the eyes and hands as well as for the brain.\n\nReview\n'This book is hard to put down. Inspiring and informative, entertaining and thought provoking, it will delight every mathematics teacher.'
