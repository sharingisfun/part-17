But, nothing to worry. Science has already identified an evergreen spring of power - nuclear energy. It's the largest source of energy that Man has ever found.\r\nHowever, though nuclear energy has wide uses, it also has, sadly, the power to destroy everything. The world still remembers the bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The disasters at nuclear power plants have also added to the fear of nuclear energy.\r\nAs the debate on its pros and cons rages on, Tell Me Why takes you to the wonder world of nuclear energy.\r\n \nhttp://s10.postimg.org/6lyr676ux/Wonders_of_Nuclear_Energy_Tell_Me_Why_91.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731a6014006e30ae93274d4351a068722bf514f2","amp;dn":"Wonders+of+Nuclear+Energy+%28Tell+Me+Why+%2391%29+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731a6014006e30ae93274d4351a068722bf514f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,26,96,20,0,110,48,174,147,39,77,67,81,160,104,114,43,245,20,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
