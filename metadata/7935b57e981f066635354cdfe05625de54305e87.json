Officials have long cited the scarcity of \n\nphysical evidence and apparent lack of motive to explain why they never solved the \n\nTylenol murders. However, new revelations and information not previously disclosed \n\ntell a very different story of a crime that should have been solved.\n\nIn a story both fascinating and dramatic in its warnings, The Tylenol Mafia rips away \n\nthe facade of an investigation that J&amp;J CEO James Burke labeled &quot;A demonstration \n\nwithout parallel of government and business working with the news media to help \n\nprotect the public.&quot; This gripping, meticulously documented expose' unearths the \n\ntroubling details of an investigation corrupted by well-connected corporate \n\nexecutives and politically motivated government officials who simply buried the truth \n\ninside a shadow legal system inaccessible to everyday Americans.\n \nPraise for The Tylenol Mafia...\nScott Bartz authored a brilliant piece of investigative journalism that reveals \n\nshocking details of what really happened when these tragic Tylenol murders were \n\ninvestigated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7935b57e981f066635354cdfe05625de54305e87","amp;dn":"The+Tylenol+Mafia+-+Marketing+%2CMurder+and+Johnson+%26amp%3B+Johnson+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7935b57e981f066635354cdfe05625de54305e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,53,181,126,152,31,6,102,53,53,76,223,224,86,37,222,84,48,94,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
