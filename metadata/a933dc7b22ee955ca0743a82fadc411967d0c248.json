I've gone ahead and copied it over with the same hash to keep it alive.\n\nAppears to have been recorded by the crew themselves as the camera is centered and steady.  The sound quality is very good so I'm assuming it came directly from the soundboard.  Whites are a bit washed out though.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamalot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamalot&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMonty Python's Spamalot is a musical comedy &quot;lovingly ripped off from&quot; the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Like the film, it is a highly irreverent parody of the Arthurian Legend, but it differs from the film in many ways, especially in its parodies of Broadway theatre. Eric Idle, a member of the Monty Python team, wrote the musical's book and lyrics and collaborated with John Du Prez on most of the music.\n\nIdle explained the title in a February 2004 press release:[citation needed]\n\nI like the title Spamalot a lot. We tested it with audiences on my recent US tour and they liked it as much as I did, which is gratifying. After all, they are the ones who will be paying Broadway prices to see the show. It comes from a line in the movie which goes: &quot;we eat ham, and jam and Spam a lot.&quot;\n\nThe original 2005 Broadway production, directed by Mike Nichols, won three Tony Awards, including the Tony Award for Best Musical of the 2004ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2005 season and received 14 Tony Award nominations. During its initial run of over 1500 performances it was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $175 million.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a933dc7b22ee955ca0743a82fadc411967d0c248","amp;dn":"Monty+Pythons+Spamalot+11262007+Australia+Melbourne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a933dc7b22ee955ca0743a82fadc411967d0c248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,51,220,123,34,238,149,92,160,116,58,130,250,220,65,25,103,208,194,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
