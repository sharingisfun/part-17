In Challenge One, the teams must install a window. Chaos ensues as they cut holes into walls and precariously perch their glass and frame inside them. Water is then blasted against the window to test the seal (rain gear required). Challenge Two is a quintessential cottage test: building a dock and diving board. Challenge Three requires some rudimentary plumbing skills: installing an outdoor shower and pump. Not surprisingly, the teams struggle with how to get the water from the lake to the showerhead. Some swim and others sink.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 20-Apr-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0760ce694692c01f67ee224dfc7e36ee960f63d2","amp;dn":"Blood.Sweat.and.Tools.S01E02.PDTV.x264-CBM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0760ce694692c01f67ee224dfc7e36ee960f63d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,96,206,105,70,146,192,31,103,238,34,77,252,126,54,238,150,15,99,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
