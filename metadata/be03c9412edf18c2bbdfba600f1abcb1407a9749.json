Members Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez (who co-wrote and co-produced most of the tracks on this album) have drawn on R&amp;B, hip-hop, and electronica to make a remarkably adult mix. While younger fans will love the disc (it is 'N Sync, after all), older listeners will be surprised and pleased by the Prince-influenced &quot;Gone,&quot; the Miami bass beat of &quot;The Two of Us,&quot; and the Stevie Wonder harmonica cameo on &quot;Something Like You.&quot; \n\nWidipedia\nCelebrity is the fifth and last studio album by the pop boy band 'N Sync. It was originally released in 2001 by Jive Records. The album achieved five times platinum status in the U.S. and became the group's third album to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. This album also holds the record for second best first week sales in SoundScan history, only behind their own previous album, No Strings Attached. The album sold almost 1.9 million units in its first week. The RIAA certified Celebrity Gold, Platinum and 6x Platinum on August 22, 2001, denoting 6 million shipments in the United States.\n\nJive Records has been criticized for releasing mostly Justin Timberlake-oriented singles, and none of which JC Chasez co-wrote or took a lead in. In his autobiography Out of Sync, Lance Bass believes that this decision ultimately caused Justin Timberlake to pursue a solo career, eventually breaking up the band.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Pop\n[02] Celebrity\n[03] The Game Is Over\n[04] Girlfriend\n[05] The Two Of Us\n[06] Gone\n[07] Tell Me, Tell Me...Baby\n[08] Up Against The Wall\n[09] See Right Through You\n[10] Selfish\n[11] Just Don't Tell Me That\n[12] Something Like You\n[13] That Girl (Will Never Be Mine)\n[14] Falling\n[15] Do Your Thing\n \n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:57m:02s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 153mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes 8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 24 July 2001\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Jive Zomba\n\n===================================================================================\n\n\nGirlfriend [CDS] - Nsync [2001]\n\t\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Girlfriend\t\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Featuring Nelly (Neptunes Remix)\n[02] The Two Of Us\n[03] Gone \t\t- (Gone Clubbin' Radio Edit)\n \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:12m:35s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 32.6mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes 8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 26 February 2002\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Jive Zomba\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.nsync-world.com/ \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be03c9412edf18c2bbdfba600f1abcb1407a9749","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Celebrity+%26+1+CDS+-+Nsync+-+185mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be03c9412edf18c2bbdfba600f1abcb1407a9749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,3,201,65,46,223,24,194,187,223,186,96,15,26,188,177,64,122,151,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
