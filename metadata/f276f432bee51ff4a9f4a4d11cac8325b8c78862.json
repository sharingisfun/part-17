This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so much because of the surprisingly high quality of the video and audio restoration (particularly considering its near forty year vintage), nor of the performance itself (which is excellent start to stop).\n\nRather, what makes Rockshow a particularly stunning achievement is when you take into account the venue where the bulk of this concert was actually recorded. SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormous Kingdome was a gigantic, indoor structure made entirely of cement. A domed stadium built primarily for SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s then NFL expansion team the Seahawks, the Kingdome was the sort of acoustical nightmare that was never meant to play host to rock shows, even of the stadium-sized variety.\n\nOver time, the NFL eventually figured out the Kingdome wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that great for football either, and in March 2000, it finally fell victim to the wrecking ball.\n\nEven so Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and despite the fact that loud amplified music really has nowhere else to go inside a gigantic cement cavern, but to bounce off the walls Ã¢â‚¬â€œ many superstar rock acts braved the challenges of the venue, and made the attempt anyway.\n\nOpening for Aerosmith at the Kingdome, Jeff Beck was so pissed off at the horrendous sound, at one point he even made a crack welcoming the crowd to Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Kingdome echo chamber.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBut in 1976, Paul McCartney &amp; Wings were the first to break the Kingdome in for rock shows. Most of us old-school veterans of SeattleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rock scene agree to this day, that from the Stones and the Eagles, to U2 and The Who, Macca still remains the only guy who was able to really pull it off. At the time, Wings Kingdome performance also set an indoor concert attendance record for North America Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drawing in an astounding 67,000 fans.\n\nimage\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : J:UppersVidzPaul McCartney Rockshow - 2013 - 720p X264 [MKV,AC3,5.1] EhhhhPaul McCartney - Rockshow - Ehhhh.mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nFile size : 3.61 GiB\nDuration : 2h 9mn\nOverall bit rate : 3 988 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2013-09-01 10:49:34\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.2.0 ('Promised Land') built on Apr 28 2013 12:22:01\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;327a5b555a727e061c03&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 14 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 2h 9mn\nBit rate : 3 500 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.158\nStream size : 3.07 GiB (85%)\nWriting library : x264 core 136 r2348+704+51 d1baef6 tMod [8-bit@all X86]\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 2h 9mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 512 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 474 MiB (13%)\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f276f432bee51ff4a9f4a4d11cac8325b8c78862","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+Rockshow+-+2013+-+720p+X264+%5BMKV%2CAC3%2C5.1%5D+Ehhhh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f276f432bee51ff4a9f4a4d11cac8325b8c78862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,118,244,50,190,229,31,244,169,244,164,209,28,172,131,37,184,199,136,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
