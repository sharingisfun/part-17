Dubbed ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½The Coltrane of the ClarinetÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ by U.K. newspaper The Guardian, Selim SeslerÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s latest project, Anatolian Wedding is a collection of ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½TurkusÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ (Turkish Folk Songs) traditionally played in the lead up to and during a Turkish wedding. Tapped by the Turkish filmmaker Fatih Ak?n, the musician has appeared in two of the directorÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s critically acclaimed films, Sesler showcases his sound in ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Against the WallÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and communicates his life story to a diverse audience in the documentary ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Crossing the BridgeÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½. The next chapter in SeslerÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s story, the album ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Anatolian WeddingÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ transports listeners through the ebb and flow of sheer happiness and infinite sadness typically experienced during wedding festivities. Stretching across the great expanse of land that is modern Turkey, SeslerÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s 13-track album is a musical tour that includes stops in the northwestern city Edirne, southeastern Urfa, northeastern Trabzon, and western Izmir, depicting sounds representative of customs from the four-corners of Turkey. Drawing on years of experience in world music, Ben Mandelson and his producing and mixing partner Rob Keyloch tune into Turkus for the first time and maximize the advantage of being ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½outsidersÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ to approach the well-loved Turkish songs with a novel outlook. The Outcome: Fresh perspectives lead to restructured arrangements, creating a solid musical substructure. This foundation serves as a launching pad of expression for the musicians to showcase their talents and deliver an album that is a modern rendering of a centuries old repertoire On this journey Ilkay Akkaya and Brenna MacCrimmon communicate with words the human emotions that Selim SeslerÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s clarinet expresses through music, sending the listener through a whirlwind of emotions, on a flight into the world of Turkus. The clarinet, violin, ud, and ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½kanunÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ combine with Roman and Balkan melodies to depict universal emotions that encapsulate the highs and lows that come with the promise of a new life and the melancholy of an impending separation, capturing once and for all the multitude of moods that accompany a Turkish Wedding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a3991963adb329e2c1ddb42694ea5fb700c40b5","amp;dn":"Selim+Sesler+-+Romanes+Clarinet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a3991963adb329e2c1ddb42694ea5fb700c40b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,57,145,150,58,219,50,158,44,29,219,66,105,78,165,251,112,12,64,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
