The show centers on protagonist Jackson &quot;Jax&quot; Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the thenÃ¢â‚¬â€œvice president of the club, who begins questioning the club and himself.\n\n\nFollowing the arrest of Tara and Clay, Jax struggles to hold SAMCRO together while Tara is imprisoned. Toric approaches both Tara and Clay and offers them deals in exchange for giving up SAMCRO; both initially refuse, but Clay later relents when confronted with being thrown into the prison's general population and assuredly being killed by inmates paid off by Damon Pope's men as a retaliation for Pope's murder. Juice returns to Charming after helping Bobby relocate after stepping down as VP, which angers Chibs, who doesn't believe Juice has been punished enough for talking to cops and later beats him. The Club also deals with a group of Iranian torture-porn filmmakers who abused Lyla; as the conflict heats up cops show up and arrest everyone; the SAMCRO members are handed off to a crooked cop who cuts deals with the locals, agrees with SAMCRO that the torture porn has to go, and has the Iranians evicted. As Tig releases the director, the man makes a crass comment about Tig's daughter. Tig then snaps and drowns the man in a bathtub filled with urine. The premiere ends with a young child, seen periodically throughout the episode, who approaches a school and pulls a machine pistol out of his backpack. He loads the weapon and enters the school; shortly thereafter screams and gunfire are heard. SAMCRO is targeted for this shooting as the supplier. \n\n\nStarring:\n----------\nCharlie Hunnam\nKatey Sagal\nMark Boone Junior\nDayton Callie\nKim Coates\nTommy Flanagan\nRyan Hurst\nJohnny Lewis\nWilliam Lucking\nTheo Rossi\nMaggie Siff\nRon Perlman\nJimmy Smits\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None \nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nAir Date: 2013\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\n\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n----------  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/2743/ruyu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img547.imageshack.us/img547/2743/ruyu.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2978/w307.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2978/w307.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/4185/9m94.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/4185/9m94.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/8416/afqh.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img546.imageshack.us/img546/8416/afqh.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/876/vgs4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/876/vgs4.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/7640/dfzk.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/7640/dfzk.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/3240/1g4a.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/3240/1g4a.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nIMDb Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124373/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124373/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/soa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fxnetworks.com/soa&lt;/a&gt;  \n\nWiki:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as BS, IMMERSE, EVOLVE, KILLERS, CtrlHD, DHD, 2HD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n\nBackups and other CARG releases can be found at ExtraTorrent, KickassTorrent and The Pirate Bay.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5efd2317d7666092503a20cb3bd0f0eac4db91ce","amp;dn":"Sons+of+Anarchy+Season+6+Complete+720+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5efd2317d7666092503a20cb3bd0f0eac4db91ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,253,35,23,215,102,96,146,80,58,32,203,59,208,240,234,196,219,145,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
