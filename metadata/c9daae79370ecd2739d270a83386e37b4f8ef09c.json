From arcades filled with sit-down cabs, market-dominating consoles, an iconic mascot in Sonic the Hedgehog and everything in-between, Sega has certainly had its ups and downs. Sega brought so many new things to the gaming world, including downloadable games way back in 1994 and a motion sensing controller called the Sega Activator. The Mega Drive, know as the Genesis in North America, sold a staggering 30 million units. But Segaâ€™s hopes and dreams came crashing down around its ears with the Dreamcastâ€™s disappointing launch in 1998. It marked the companyâ€™s final foray into home consoles and ushered in the era of third-party software development for other gaming platforms. With Sega Archives you can relive Segaâ€™s colourful history, from early coin-op capers and the abandoning of the Master Systemâ€™s first mascot, Alex Kidd, to the gamble and subsequent failure of the Mega-CD and Mega Drive 32X. Weâ€™ve scoured the Retro Gamer archives to bring you amazingly in-depth articles on some of Segaâ€™s biggest games and franchises, as well as looking at the home consoles. Itâ€™s the perfect way to celebrate Segaâ€™s timeless achievements.\r\n\r\nSega Archives 2016\r\nEnglish | 180 pages | True PDF | 57.00 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9daae79370ecd2739d270a83386e37b4f8ef09c","amp;dn":"Sega+Archives+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9daae79370ecd2739d270a83386e37b4f8ef09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,218,174,121,55,14,205,39,57,210,112,168,51,134,227,123,79,142,240,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
