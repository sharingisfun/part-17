These tracks that I have collected under the banner of &amp;#039;Oldies&amp;#039; are a broad spectrum, coming from all aspects of the genre. Theres tracks coming from all the major nighters during the 70&amp;#039;s Wigan,Cleethorpes,Blackpool Mecca as well as the Great original nighters The Golden Torch, The Twisted Wheel and Catacombes. There will be many that you know but hopefully one or two you have been looking for.\nThese tracks were ripped either by me or friends on the scene ( Thanks alot guys ~ Keep the Faith) and painstakingly put together for your listening pleasure.\nunionjack ~ Soul as Deep as You Like and Some\nps See ya at St Ives Anniversary!!!\n\nA Little Togetherness The Younghearts.mp3\nBarbara + Brenda Never Love a Robin.mp3\nBarbara Mills  Queen Of Fools northern Soul.mp3\nBill Blacks Combo Little Queenie.mp3\nBilly Arnell  Tough girl.mp3\nBilly Butler  The Right Track.MP3\nBlue Sharks  These things will keep me lovin you .mp3\nBob &amp; Earl  Harlem Shuffle.mp3\nBob &amp; Earl  Land Of 1000 Dances.mp3\nBob and Fred  I&amp;#039;ll Be On My Way.mp3\nBob Brady  More, More, More of Your Love.mp3\nBob Brady &amp; The Conchords  Everybody&amp;#039;s Going To A  Love In.mp3\nBob Relf  Blowing My Mind to Pieces.mp3\nBob Relf Blowing My mind to pieces.mp3\nBobby Goldsboro  It&amp;#039;s Too Late.mp3\nBobby Hebb Love Love Love.mp3\nBobby Sheen Dr Love.mp3\nCharlie Rich Love is After Me .mp3\nChaumonts   I Need Your Love.mp3\nChuck Jackson Any Day Now mp3\nChuck Wood Seven Days Is Too Long.mp3\nContinental 4 Heaven Must Have Sent You.MP3\nCooperettes Shing A Ling.MP3\nCrying Over You  Duke Browner - T.mp3\nCurtis Mayfield  Move on Up.mp3\nDanny Moore Somebody New.mp3\nDarrell Banks  Our Love (Is In The Pocket).mp3\nDavid &amp; The Giants  Ten Miles High.mp3\nDel-Larks  Job Opening (Part 1).mp3\nDetroit Executives   Cool Off.mp3\nDobie Gray - Out on the floor.MP3\nDobie Gray  The In Crowd.mp3\nDynamics Yes I Love You Baby.mp3\nEddie Foster  I Never Knew.mp3\nEddie Parker Love You Baby.mp3\nEdwin Starr My Kind Of Woman.mp3\nEloise Laws Love Factory.MP3\nErma Franklin  I Get The Sweetest Feeling.MP3\nEvelyn Thomas Weak Spot.mp3\nFats Dominoe It Keeps Raining .mp3\nFelice Taylor - I Feel Love Coming On.MP3\nFrankie Beverly &amp; The Butlers Becuase of My Heart.mp3\nGene Chandler  Mr Big Shot .mp3\nGene Chandler  Nothing Can Stop Me.mp3\nGeorge &amp;#039;Juke&amp;#039; Byrd   I Know I&amp;#039;m In Love with You.mp3\nHoagy Lands Next in Line .mp3\nHomer Banks  Sixty Minutes Of Your Love.mp3\nHoney Bee  Johnny Johnson &amp; The Bandwagon .mp3\nI Love You Baby  Cindy Scott .mp3\nI&amp;#039;m Standing- Rufus Lumley.mp3\nInez &amp; Charlie Foxx  Never Love A Robin.mp3\nInez + Charlie Fox Tightrope.mp3\nJacky Lee The Duck.mp3\nJames Bounty    Prove yourself a lady .mp3\nJamo Thomas  I Spy for the FBI.mp3\nJeanette White    Music .mp3\nJerry Butler &amp; Etta James  Let It Be Me.mp3\nJerry Butler Moody Woman.mp3\nJerry Williams  If You Ask Me.mp3\nJJ Barnes Talk of the Grapevine.mp3\nJ.J.
