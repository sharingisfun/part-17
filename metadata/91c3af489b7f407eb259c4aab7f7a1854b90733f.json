It follows on from their critically acclaimed album The Quiet Lamb. Written over the course of the last three tumultuous years as life, death, distance, divorce and everything else in between tried its best to pull the band apart. It retains the bands own personal sound of soaring strings, and crescendos with footing equally in rock, electronica and folk. The album was written largely by Tom (Vocals/guitar) and Adam (Drums/keys) sending countless demo s to each other over several years. Navigator is a story of dreams that fail and do not materialise as youth slips away. It is the story of leaving one life behind and heading into the unknown of another. It is a story of losing love, life, faith and identity, and the great depression that brings. More importantly, it is about finding the way back home again. http://hernameiscalla.com UK Dates : 29th April St Pancras Old Church London, 2nd May Handmade Festival Leicester, 3rd Handmade Festival Leicester, 4th Handmade Festival Leicester, 6th Soup Kitchen Manchester, 7th Stereo Glasgow, 8th The Blue Room Blackpool, 10th All Saint Church Cambridge // Press : Rock a Rolla (Lead Review w Photo) NME Artrocker, Drowned in Sound, Big Issue, Clash, Crack, Classic Prog, Fake DIY, Loud N Quiet, NARC, No Cigar Mag, Q, Rhubarb Bomb, The Skinny, AAA, Bearded Mag, Echoes and Dust, God is in the TV, Quietus, Subbaculture, The 405, Line of best Fit , Mojo, Uncut.
