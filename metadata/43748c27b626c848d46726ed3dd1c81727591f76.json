How can you go wrong with\n a band that possesses a tight, accessible rock sound with the ability\n to take everything down and lay down a sweet groove,\n all while keeping an intensity and never losing sight of what they are trying\n to achieve with this album? Not to mention Brandon BoydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique lyrics,\n which he sings near perfectly, and the fantastic bass skills of Dirk Lance.\n Make Yourself may be IncubusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ finest work, the perfect blend of their aggression\n and their funk-rock roots. I understand why people find this a mediocre album\n in the grand scheme of things. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not technically challenging.\n It didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t change the face of modern music forever;\n although it finished the 20th century off well by producing some singles with\n some real staying power (Drive, Pardon Me, and Stellar).\n But this might just be the most well executed blend of\n everything going around in the modern rock scene in 1999.\n\nThat poster I mentioned in the opening is in my room now.\n It features that Transformers like artwork found in the album jacket,\n with a robot composed of all different parts.\n This represents the amount of influences and sounds\n incorporated into IncubusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sound. It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t immediately apparent because\n it is so well blended, but there are the funky grooves from bassist Dirk Lance,\n the punk energy of drummer Jose Pasillas, the clear DJ cuts screaming from\n DJ Kilmore, and guitarist Mike EinzingerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to switch styles on the fly.\n Although a hybrid of many different things, Make Yourself is a cohesive album,\n with a defining concept of non-conformity and acting upon ideas.\n The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s message, one of resisting oppression and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œseeing the skyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½,\n is a break from the sarcasm and humor often used by singer\n Brandon Boyd in his earlier days.\n\nAll of those ideas are great, but there are plenty of bands that\n have tried it and failed, just creating a strange, ineffective sound.\n But even greater than the mix of sounds and the great album ideas is the execution.\n The album brews in its intensity and still,\n it comes down in intensity and rises back to its normal height in the blink of an eye.\n Never before Make Yourself had Incubus tried to be subtle. To this point,\n they were anything but. However, The Warmth serves as the first\n Incubus song ever where they took the time to slow\n things down and make something subtle. And it worked,\n maybe better than any other song on the album.\n The song begins with sampled whale cries, definitely an atmosphere setter.\n As the bass and drums sets in and the Smashing Pumpkins-esque guitar line sings,\n the song brews in its quiet, laid back groove. There is a good sense of growth,\n making sure that the longest song on the album does not drag.\n The simple rhythmic bridge offers a change of feels,\n as the rest of the song relies on the same groove and chord progression,\n just different articulation. BrandonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics are uplifting\n and depressing at the same time, singing that most of the world is a cold,\n heartless place, but there is a small section of life, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe warmthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that is a calm place.\n\nThe Warmth is an anomaly on Make Yourself. The definitive sound to the album\n is much more aggressive and generally heavier. Pardon Me,\n a single that found immense success,\n still finding time on the radio airwaves 8 years later,\n best describes that sound. It features a rocking riff,\n simple yet still perfectly executed and written.\n The verse brings things down and Brandon does more of a rap than singing.\n With the typical quiet verse-heavy chorus structure,\n the song works out perfectly as a single.\n DJ KilmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s turntable work on the song adds variety and substance,\n enough to keep things interesting throughout.\n Pardon Me is the best single to come off of Make Yourself,\n with its catchy riffs and execution. Elsewhere on the album,\n the sound is executed with less success, such as Privilege,\n Nowhere Fast, and Out From Under. Nowhere Fast is the worst of these,\n simply not executing the catchy hooks the way the other songs do.\n\nWhether itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the acoustic Drive, the spacey Stellar,\n or the ethnic percussion-filled Clean that gets you,\n something about this album appeals to just about everyone.\n It just so happens that I love just about all of it,\n which makes me have a higher opinion about this album than most.\n It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the most technical or challenging album ever,\n itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s definitely a step up from the general mainstream rock scene.\n Dirk Lance is the best bassist in mainstream music,\n challenged only by Flea, but even Flea does not have the big bass tone\n or the creativity of Dirk Lance. As proven in the jam Battlestar Scralatchica,\n he blends better with his guitarist as well.\n Einzinger and Lance had a chemistry between them\n seen in few guitarist/bassist combos. Make Yourself,\n as a whole, is a true mainstream rock album. It has great singles,\n it branches off into new territory,\n and it derives from musical and lyrical clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s.\n DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t throw it off just because it is mainstream, take a listen.\n\n\n\nRecommended Tracks:\n\n.
