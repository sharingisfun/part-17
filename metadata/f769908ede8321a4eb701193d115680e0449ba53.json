Thriller\n\n\nFrom a formidable new voice in suspense fiction comes an edge-of-the-seat story of a homicide detective on the trail of a killer, who slays with exacting precision, and who harbors a terrifying motive\n\nDetective Sergeant Michael McCabe moved from New York City to Portland, Maine, to escape a dark past: both the ex-wife whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d left him for an investment banker, and the tragic death of his brother, a hero cop gone bad. He sought to raise his young daughter away from the violence of the big city . . . so heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unprepared for the horrific killer he discovers, whose bloody trail may lead to PortlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social elite.\n\nEarly on a September evening, the mutilated body of a pretty teenaged girl, a high school soccer star, is found dumped in a scrap-metal yard. She had been viciously assaulted, but her heart had been cut out of her chest withsurgical precision. The very same day a young businesswoman, also a blonde and an athlete, was abducted as she jogged through the streets of the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s west end. McCabe suspects both crimes are the work of the same man---a killer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s targeting the young---who is clearly well-versed in complex surgical procedures, and who may have struck before. Just as the investigation is beginning, McCabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-wife reemerges, suddenly determined to reclaim the daughter she heedlessly abandoned years earlier.\n\nWith the help of his straight-talking (and, at times, alluring) partner, Maggie Savage, McCabe begins a race against time to rescue the missing woman and unmask a sadistic killer---before more lives are lost.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f769908ede8321a4eb701193d115680e0449ba53","amp;dn":"The+Cutting+by+James+Hayman+%5BMcCabe+and+Savage+%231%5D+%7BRose88%7D++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f769908ede8321a4eb701193d115680e0449ba53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,105,144,142,222,131,33,164,235,112,17,147,209,21,104,14,4,73,186,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
