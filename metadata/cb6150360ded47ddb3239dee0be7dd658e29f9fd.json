Still operating on the theory that &quot;No boy is bad, if given a chance&quot;, Father Flanagan has created Boys Town, a nondemoninational sanctuary for wayward and homeless youngsters in Omaha, Nebraska. Despite the success of his operation insofar as building the character of his charges, the good Father is confronted with ever-mounting debts, and this time not even his old pawnbroker pal Dave Morris (Lee J. Cobb) can come to the rescue. Meanwhile, Whitey Marsh is adopted by the Maitlands, a wealthy couple--a fact that disillusions a sullen, crippled youngster named Ted Martley (Larry Nunn), who'd hoped that the Maitlands would choose him. Upon leaving Boys Town, Whitey tries to pay a visit to his old pal Miles Fenley, who is an inmate in a crooked reform school, but is denied entrance. Driving away from the reformatory, Whitey discovers that a boy from the school, Flips (Darryl Hickman), has stowed away in his car. Whitey agrees not to turn Flip in--a decision he has reason to regret when he is arrested for a robbery committed by Flip. Sent to the same reform school as Miles Fenley, Whitey learns first-hand of the institution's corruption and brutality. He manages to get word to Father Flanagan, who despite his ongoing financial woes takes on the reformatory's unsavory officials and secures a release for Whitey and Flip. But there is still one problem to overcome: Convincing the resentful Ted Martley that the world isn't as bad as he thinks it is. Boasting enough plots for ten films, Men of Boys Town may not have been as good as its predecessor, but it proved to be another box-office bonanza for Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Men of Boys Town.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.25 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 48mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 644 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 48mn\n      Bit rate : 1 509 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.205\n      Stream size : 1.15 GiB (92%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 48mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 99.7 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 83 ms (2.00 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033902/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033902/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by BucasYotos, whom we thank\n\nNorman Taurog - Men of Boys Town (1941)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb6150360ded47ddb3239dee0be7dd658e29f9fd","amp;dn":"Norman+Taurog+-+Men+of+Boys+Town+%281941%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb6150360ded47ddb3239dee0be7dd658e29f9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,97,80,54,13,237,71,221,179,35,157,238,11,231,221,101,142,41,249,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
