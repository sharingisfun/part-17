So, first head into the garden and learn to harvest your own herbs, and then head into your kitchen and whip up a batch of raspberry cough syrup, or perhaps a soothing elixir to erase the daily stresses of modern life.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\nJAMES GREEN is the founder of Simplers Botanical Company and is a professional founding member of the American Herbalists Guild and United Plant Savers.
