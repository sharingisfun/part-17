The author tells the story of the land between two rivers - the Tigris and the Euphrates - where civilization began. Asimov describes history of Near East region (focusing on Mesopotamia) from early Sumerian days (5000+ BC) until few years after WW2 and creation of modern states in the region.\r\n\r\nAbout OCR: I think it's the first ever scan of this book. I plan to do (slowly) scans also of other Asimov's History books, as they are written in quite understandable language","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:233b11127513995bf3fd58fa3f7fa043af6936fd","amp;dn":"The+Near+East+10000+Years+Of+History+-+Isaac+Asimov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"233b11127513995bf3fd58fa3f7fa043af6936fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,59,17,18,117,19,153,91,243,253,88,250,63,127,160,67,175,105,54,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
