This paper reports on an effort to do so, using a\nunique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues.\n\nMultivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business\ninterests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens\nand mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide\nsubstantial support for theories of Economic Elite Domination and for theories of Biased\nPluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.\n\n= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =\n\nremembering Michael C.
