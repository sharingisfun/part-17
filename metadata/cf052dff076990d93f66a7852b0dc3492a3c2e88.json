Kernighan, Dennis M.

It is the definitive reference guide, now in a second edition. Although the first edition was written in 1978, it continues to be a worldwide best-seller. This second edition brings the classic original up to date to include the ANSI standard. \n\nFrom the Preface: \nWe have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.\nAs we said in the first preface to the first edition, C &quot;wears well as one's experience with it grows.&quot; With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you to learn C and use it well.\n\nAbout this author :-\n\nBrian Wilson Kernighan is a computer scientist who worked at Bell Labs alongside Unix creators Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and contributed greatly to Unix and its school of thought\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Dennis_MacAlistair_Ritchie_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Dennis_MacAlistair_Ritchie_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707fcd970c-pi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707fcd970c-pi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf052dff076990d93f66a7852b0dc3492a3c2e88","amp;dn":"The+C+Programming+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf052dff076990d93f66a7852b0dc3492a3c2e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,5,45,255,7,105,144,217,63,102,167,133,43,13,195,73,42,60,46,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
