Following up the intense, strong Why Do They Call Me Mr. Happy? might have been a challenging task for some bands, but NoMeansNo keeps the quality high and the playing loud and good throughout the album's nearly hour length. There's a little more emphasis on the directness of the singing this time out, while the guitars in particular sound less-immediately overwhelming. It's not quite a toning down, more a way of finding a new balance, and certainly the midsong breaks and epic rave-up stomp of songs like &quot;He Learned How to Bleed&quot; are hardly power ballads. If anything, there's a slippery, more fun embrace of poppiness than ever before -- check out the near-prime Cheap Trick sass of &quot;Humans,&quot; the near-HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼sker DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼-like level of anthemic punk in &quot;Tuck It Away,&quot; or the almost rockabilly-into-swing attitude of &quot;Predators.&quot; Nearly every song shoots along at a fast clip, but there is a period of slower beats and riffs -- &quot;My Politics&quot; starts off a bit calmer and even hits a reggae midsection before turning back into a monstrous rock slash, while &quot;State of Grace&quot; finds slower moments to its advantage. If there's a point of sheer, overwhelming musical power, &quot;Lost,&quot; with its complex construction and arrangement -- showing the stop-on-a-dime rhythm skills of the group just as well as their vocal and lyrical intensity -- is the number. Building up to at least two separate and equally compelling climaxes, it's another in the series of high points from a truly remarkable band.  --Ned Raggett, AMG\n\n\nReleased \tOctober 1995\nRecorded \t1995\nGenre \t\tPunk rock\nLength \t\t51:19\nLabel \t\tAlternative Tentacles\nProducer \tNomeansno\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Tom Holliston - Guitar, Vocals\n* John Wright - Vocals, Drums, Keyboards\n* Rob Wright - Vocals, Bass\n\n\nThis is NMR, probably from a nifty russian site, thanks to the original uploader.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7deb19a5016b74e045591f4cbee7d45e4e73d569","amp;dn":"NoMeansNo+-1995-+The+Worldhood+Of+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7deb19a5016b74e045591f4cbee7d45e4e73d569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,235,25,165,1,107,116,224,69,89,31,76,190,231,212,94,78,115,213,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
