Leonard Lawlor interprets key texts by major figures in the continental tradition, including Bergson, Foucault, Freud, Heidegger, Husserl, and Merleau-Ponty, to develop the broad sweep of the aims of continental philosophy. Lawlor discusses major theoretical trends in the work of these philosophersÃ¢â‚¬â€immanence, difference, multiplicity, and the overcoming of metaphysics. His conception of continental philosophy as a unified project enables Lawlor to think beyond its European origins and envision a global sphere of philosophical inquiry that will revitalize the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aae60b505c8014f8e8781c254962025750cac24","amp;dn":"Early+Twentieth-Century+Continental+Philosophy+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aae60b505c8014f8e8781c254962025750cac24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,174,96,181,5,200,1,79,142,135,129,194,84,150,32,37,117,12,172,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
