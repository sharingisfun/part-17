There were always little reminders pasted on the kitchen wall. For example, the word THINK. I found THINK thumbtacked on a bulletin board in her darkroom. I saw it Scotch-taped on a pencil box sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d collaged. I even found a pamphlet titled THINK on her bedside table. Mom liked to THINK.\n\nSo begins Diane KeatonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unforgettable memoir about her mother and herself. In it you will meet the woman known to tens of millions as Annie Hall, but you will also meet, and fall in love with, her mother, the loving, complicated, always-thinking Dorothy Hall. To write about herself, Diane realized she had to write about her mother, too, and how their bond came to define both their lives. In a remarkable act of creation, Diane not only reveals herself to us, she also lets us meet in intimate detail her mother. Over the course of her life, Dorothy kept eighty-five journalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½literally thousands of pagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in which she wrote about her marriage, her children, and, most probingly, herself. Dorothy also recorded memorable stories about DianeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grandparents. Diane has sorted through these pages to paint an unflinching portrait of her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a woman restless with intellectual and creative energy, struggling to find an outlet for her talentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as well as her entire family, recounting a story that spans four generations and nearly a hundred years.\n\nMore than the autobiography of a legendary actress, Then Again is a book about a very American family with very American dreams. Diane will remind you of yourself, and her bonds with her family will remind you of your own relationships with those you love the most.\n\nCONTENTS\nPart One\nChapter 1 - Dorothy\nChapter 2 - Jack\nPart Two\nChapter 3 - Manhattan\nChapter 4 - Big Year\nChapter 5 - The List\nChapter 6 - The Uphill Climb Versus the Downhill Slide\nChapter 7 - Di-Annie Hall\nChapter 8 - Something Big for a Small Family\nPart Three\nChapter 9 - Artistic\nChapter 1 0 - This Isn't Sometimes, This Is Always\nChapter 1 1 - Aftermath\nChapter 1 2 - Hello\nChapter 1 3 - The Gray Zone\nChapter 1 4 - Then Again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28141e461a1dc194a05ddd8492d292b7604a2937","amp;dn":"Then+Again+by+Diane+Keaton+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28141e461a1dc194a05ddd8492d292b7604a2937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,20,30,70,26,29,193,148,160,93,221,132,146,210,146,183,96,74,41,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
