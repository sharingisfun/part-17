Spalato and Ragusa intersect with Constantinople, Cairo and Spanish Naples just as Sinan, Palladio and Robert Adam cross paths in this liquid expanse. \n\nConcentrating on materiality and on the arts, architecture in particular, the authors identify portability and hybridity as characteristic of these exchanges, and tease out expected and unexpected serendipitous moments when they occurred. Focusing on translation and its instruments these essays expand the traditional concept of influence by thrusting mobility and the &quot;hardware&quot; of cultural transmission, its mechanisms, rather than its effects, into the foreground.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e78aacd402b823855b60eff530d2f37dc98536e8","amp;dn":"Dalmatia+and+The+Mediterranean+-+Portable+Archaeology+and+the+Po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e78aacd402b823855b60eff530d2f37dc98536e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,138,172,212,2,184,35,133,91,96,239,245,48,210,243,125,201,133,54,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
