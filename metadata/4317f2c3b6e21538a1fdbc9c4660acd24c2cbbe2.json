I Tried to Rock You could be an answer to the many listless Sensitive Guys clogging 2001 airwaves; Naess's vulnerability sounds not like a ploy to land her on teen-flick soundtrack albums, but like an honest reaction to the love troubles she's encountered since her debut. Open-hearted but never at a loss when it comes to tapping her own strength, Naess is arched-eyebrow funny when dissing and dismissing a lover in the title track, happily puzzled when admitting in &quot;Sunny Sunday&quot; that &quot;I didn't mean to like u so much.&quot; Now that the press has lost interest in focusing on her beauty and privileged background (she is the daughter of Diana Ross's ex-husband Arne Naess), the field is clear for Naess's sensible love songs to resound--as it does perhaps most clearly when she reconfigures a pop-culture watchword to read &quot;boys like you never cry.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4317f2c3b6e21538a1fdbc9c4660acd24c2cbbe2","amp;dn":"Leona+Naess+-+I+Tried+to+Rock+You+but+You+Only+Roll+%5B2001%5D%5BEAC%2Cl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4317f2c3b6e21538a1fdbc9c4660acd24c2cbbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,23,242,195,182,226,21,56,161,253,188,156,70,96,172,210,76,44,187,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
