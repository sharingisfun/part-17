Will Crash and Coco be up to the challenge?\n  You can bet your bandicoot they will! \n\n  * The biggest adventure ever: 30 new action-filled levels in\n    jam-packed environments. \n\n  * Multiple modes of vehicular mayhem: Control 8 different vehicles -\n    from a Crash Glider to a giant robot suit. \n\n  * You go girl: For the first time, Crash's tough-as-nails sister,\n    Coco, is fully playable. \n\n  * Positively eyeball popping: The most dazzling special effects ever\n    seen in a Crash game. \n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &quot;MODE1/2048&quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a64a5318dfe73c023b24641caca72b6bcb34feaf","amp;dn":"Crash+Bandicoot+The+Wrath+of+Cortex+XBOX+-+ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a64a5318dfe73c023b24641caca72b6bcb34feaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,74,83,24,223,231,60,2,59,36,100,28,172,167,43,107,203,52,254,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
