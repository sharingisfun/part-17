Talented and ambitious, the trio found a small theater company that enjoys unexpected early success. Then, one fateful evening, Luke meets Nina Jacobs, a dynamic and emotionally damaged actress he cannot forget, even after she drifts into a marriage with a manipulative theater producer.\n\nAs Luke becomes a highly sought after playwright, he stumbles in love, caught in two triangles where love requited and unrequited, friendship, and art will clash with terrible consequences for all involved.\n\nFallout is an elegantly crafted novel whose characters struggle to escape the various cataclysms of their respective pasts. Falling in love convinces us we are the pawns of the gods; Fallout brings us firmly into the psyche of romantic love Ã¢â‚¬â€ its sickness and its ecstasy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c433bc8c0d2ff09f66f13f6c728d05f5e831f515","amp;dn":"Fallout+%28Sadie+Jones%29+Retail+epub+mobi+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c433bc8c0d2ff09f66f13f6c728d05f5e831f515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,51,188,140,13,47,240,159,102,241,63,108,114,141,5,245,232,49,245,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
