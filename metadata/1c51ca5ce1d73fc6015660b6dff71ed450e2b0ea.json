Comer (Author)\n\nHardcover: 768 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 5th edition (April 28, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0136066984\nISBN-13: 978-0136066989\nASIN: 0136061273\n\nComputer Networks and Internets is appropriate for all introductory-to-intermediate courses in computer networking, the Internet, or Internet applications; readers need no background in networking, operating systems, or advanced mathematics.\n \nLeading networking authority Douglas Comer presents a wide-ranging, self-contained tour of the concepts, principles, and technologies that enable todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Internet to support applications ranging from web browsing to telephony and multimedia. This Fifth Edition has been thoroughly reorganized, revised, and updated: it includes extensive new coverage of topics ranging from wireless protocols to network performance, while reducing or eliminating coverage of older protocols and technologies. Comer begins by illuminating the applications and facilities offered by todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Internet. Next, he systematically introduces the underlying network technologies and protocols that make them possible: low-level data communications; packet switching, LAN, and WAN technologies; and Internet protocols such as TCP, IP, UDP, and IPv6. With these concepts and technologies established, he introduces several of the most important contemporary issues faced by network implementers and managers, including quality of service, Internet telephony, multimedia, network security, and network management. Comer has carefully designed this book to support both top-down and bottom-up teaching approaches. Students need no background in operating systems, and no sophisticated math: Comer relies throughout on figures, drawings, examples, and analogies, not mathematical proofs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c51ca5ce1d73fc6015660b6dff71ed450e2b0ea","amp;dn":"Computer+Networks+and+Internets+%285e%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c51ca5ce1d73fc6015660b6dff71ed450e2b0ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,81,202,92,225,215,63,198,1,86,96,182,223,247,30,212,80,226,176,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
