A young Princess Elizabeth is surrounded by uncertainty. She is not currently in line for the throne, but remains a threat to her older sister and brother.\n\nIn the midst of this fevered atmosphere comes an unprecedented invitation from the Sultan in Constantinople. He seeks to assemble the finest chess players from the whole civilised world and pit them against each other.\n\nRoger Ascham, Elizabeth's teacher and mentor in the art of power and politics, is determined to keep her out of harm's way and resolves to take Elizabeth with him when he travels to the glittering Ottoman capital for the tournament.\n\nBut once there, the two find more danger than they left behind. There's a killer on the loose and a Catholic cardinal has already been found mutilated. Ascham is asked by the Sultan to investigate the crime. But as he and Elizabeth delve deeper, they find dark secrets, horrible crimes and unheard-of depravity. Things that mark the young princess for life and define the queen she will become.\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:116de9e82806eda7e28ce23bb88d896c64373060","amp;dn":"The+Tournament+by+Matthew+Reilly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"116de9e82806eda7e28ce23bb88d896c64373060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,109,233,232,40,6,237,167,226,140,226,59,184,141,137,108,100,55,48,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
