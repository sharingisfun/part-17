In a genre often intended for social delight with two performers engaged at one keyboard, Schubert produced some major masterpieces. This includes everything on this disc. Some years ago, Sony issued three two-CD sets and one CD that encompassed all the music the composer left for the genre. Unfortunately, they are no longer available. But for those unfamiliar with these works, this disc, produced in 1979, offers as fine an introduction to them as one might want. Contemporary with the composerâ€™s last three piano sonatas, they are melodically rich, harmonically bold, and often ethereal in their otherworldly gentleness. Indeed, here is music that illustrates how Leonard Bernstein made a grave omission when he said, â€œAlone among all composers, Beethoven had a direct line to God.â€ He should have included Schubert. Everything about the playing here does justice to the music. Allegros are animated but never rushed; strange modulations are not spoiled by overstatement; and, where apt, as in the two marches, the playing crackles with vibrant energy. With Hungarotonâ€™s fine reproduction, this remains an especially distinguished release that no one who cares about Schubert can afford to miss.&quot;\r\nMortimer H. Frank\r\n\r\n1.
