Not just for petrol heads, it also has a huge following amongst people with little or no interest in cars - both male and female. This is due to the show's irreverent approach to motoring, the humour and the priceless chemistry between the show's presenters. A global audience of 350 million can't be wrong.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d76f46bd21ec98faceaf6930ed4f8152bc15670c","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.S14E03.HDTV.XviD-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d76f46bd21ec98faceaf6930ed4f8152bc15670c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,111,70,189,33,236,152,250,206,175,105,48,237,79,129,82,188,21,103,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
