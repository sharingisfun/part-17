This legendary concert film, covering a 1979 Paris concert during the Australian heavy metal band's &quot;Highway To Hell&quot; tour showcases the power and precision that the quintet bring to vicious rockers like &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; and &quot;Let There Be Rock.&quot;\nPixieish lead guitarist Angus Young, attired in his trademark school-boy's uniform, takes center stage with his energetic antics and frenetic solos, while the rest of the band crank out their minimalist boogie with quiet determination.\nEspecially AC/DC's flamboyant lead singer Bon Scott, who died two months after this filmed concert.\n\nAll songs composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
