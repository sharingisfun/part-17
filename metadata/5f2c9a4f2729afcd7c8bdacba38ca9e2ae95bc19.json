Marty stamped his own identity on it all. Here are the great early hits: I'll Go On Alone, That's All Right, Mean Mama Blues, Maybelline, Tennessee Toddy, Mister Teardrop, Singing The Blues, Knee Deep In The Blues, and I Can't Quit. There's also the complete vocal-guitar session of folk songs and traditional songs, the first Hawaiian LP, the rock 'n' roll sides, and the duets. Essential! The fifth CD is a complete session, including all the false starts and alternate takes, for a real fly-on-the-wall listening experience!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f2c9a4f2729afcd7c8bdacba38ca9e2ae95bc19","amp;dn":"Marty+Robbins+-+Country+1951-1958++%5BBear+Family+5+disc+set%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f2c9a4f2729afcd7c8bdacba38ca9e2ae95bc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,44,154,79,39,41,175,205,124,139,218,203,163,140,169,226,174,149,188,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
