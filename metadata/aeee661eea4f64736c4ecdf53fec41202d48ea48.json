D. Wingfield. Writing credit for the three episodes in the first 1992 series went to Richard Harris, with screenplays credited to Wingfield.\n\nThe series stars David Jason as Detective Inspector William Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Frost, an experienced and dedicated detective who frequently clashes with his superiors. In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.\n\nA number of young actors had their major debut as supporting cast in the show, including Matt Bardock, Ben Daniels, Neil Stuke, Mark Letheren, Colin Buchanan, Jason Maza, Damian Lewis and Marc Warren.\n\n\nEpisode Descriptions Courtesy Of:\n\nThe On-Line Television Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&amp;seriesid=76247&amp;seasonid=10003&amp;lid=7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&amp;seriesid=76247&amp;seasonid=10003&amp;lid=7&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1992-12-06 - Care and Protection (Video:H264 720x544, 997kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 115kbps)\n\nNursing his terminally-ill wife, Detective Inspector 'Jack' Frost's life becomes more stressed when, during a missing-child investigation, he unearths evidence on a 30-year-old case involving a skeleton chained to a locked strongbox that turns out to be empty.\n\n\n1992-12-13 - Not with Kindness (Video:H264 720x544, 996kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 112kbps)\n\nFrost investigates the murder of a teenage girl, and the case of a woman who has been receiving threatening phone calls.
