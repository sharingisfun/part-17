Featuring some of the most important figures in contemporary African music as well as many discoveries who aren&amp;#039;t yet known outside their homeland, An Afro-Portuguese Odyssey captures the magic of a unique musical world.

An Afro-Portuguese Odyssey continues and expands on this journey by revisiting the music of Cape Verde and uncovering more melodic musical gems from other Lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) countries such as Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique. \n\nTracklist:\nPaulo Flores - Ze Inacio \nMabulu - Maldeyeni \nEneida Marta - Na Bu Mons \nMendes Brothers - Cor Di Rosa \nRuy Mingas - Homenagem A Liceu Vieira Dias \nAgusto Cego - Nha Fidjo \nBanda Maravilha - Canta Forte \nManecas Costa - Ermons Di Terra \nBidinte - Considjo Di Garandis \nDulce Neves - N&amp;#039;tchanha \nZe Manel - Bu Fidjo Femia \nLeonel Almeida - Ti Jom Poca \nJovino Dos Santos - Africa Mamae \n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf5fee0eae355731f954b89554693d03d8ed726","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Afro-Portugese+Odyssey+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf5fee0eae355731f954b89554693d03d8ed726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,245,254,224,234,227,85,115,31,149,75,137,85,70,147,208,61,142,215,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
