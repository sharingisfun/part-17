The game is based on the 2003 TV series. The main gameplay loosely adapts the following season one episodes: Things Change, A Better Mouse Trap, Attack of the Mousers, Meet Casey Jones, Nano, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The Way of Invisibility, Notes From the Underground (Parts 1-3), and Return to New York (Parts 1-3), as well as a level that is not derived from the animated series at all.\n\nGameplay\nThe player can play as either Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo or Raphael. Each turtle has his own unique set of levels to complete. There is a story mode for one or two players, and there is also a versus mode where two players can fight head to head. In the versus mode, players can fight as all 4 turtles, Splinter, Casey Jones, Hamato Yoshi, The Turtlebot, Hun, Oroku Saki, and Shredder. A Challenge mode is unlockable by defeating Oroku Saki with any Turtle in the Story Mode, which needs to be complete to unlock Hamato Yoshi and his dojo. There are also third-person view races, a shell-glider level for Donatello and a bike race between Raphael and Casey Jones.\n\nPlot\nShortly after a group of mouser robots destroy the turtles' old home, they begin to attack their new home. Michelangelo eventually gets on Raphael's nerves, making Raphael leave to the surface. At the surface, he is confronted by Purple Dragon thugs, Casey Jones, and Dragonface. Baxter Stockman soon uses invisible foot tech ninjas to capture Raphael, and Donatello is forced to rescue him. Afterward, the are confronted by genetically mutated beings. The turtles decide to eliminate the Shredder and defeat him once and for all.\n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;tmnt.exe&quot; \n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30e4dedd42e11fd0c5ce75d164db9fe67b4b9641","amp;dn":"Teenage.Mutant.Ninja.Turtles.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30e4dedd42e11fd0c5ce75d164db9fe67b4b9641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,228,222,221,66,225,31,208,197,206,117,209,100,219,159,230,123,75,150,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
