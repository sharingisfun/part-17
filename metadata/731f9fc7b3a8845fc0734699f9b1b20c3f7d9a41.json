Tighter\nThe Gourds are notorious for their haphazard lyrical subjects (ranging from Shakespeare to flatulence), and Haymaker! is no exception. Songwriters Kevin Russell and Jimmy Smith jumble together a wide range of storiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whores working the &quot;Tex-Mex Mile,&quot; a &quot;fossil contender&quot; digging up ancient skulls and a moonlit drive to Jericho in a &quot;rusted automobileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like a group of tattered, brightly-painted marionettes dancing to the hoe-down tune of accordions, harmonicas, strings and drums.\n\nOn previous albums, especially 2006's Heavy Ornamentals, the band has woven tongue-in-cheek contempt for its subjects into many of its stories, from a slew of inconsiderate cohabitators (&quot;New Roommate&quot;), to college kids with special knowledge (&quot;The Education Song&quot;). But on Haymaker!, Russell and Smith pursue their character sketches with considerably more empathy than previous years. In the second track, the narrator asks the &quot;fossil contender,&quot; &quot;Well how would you feel / If I dug up your head?&quot; In &quot;Bridget,&quot; a sparkling dialogue occurs between a young political zealot and a cynical old man on a road trip, which teases out each character's humorous lack of understanding for the other. Despite the humor, the song ends on a strangely compassionate note, as the &quot;old geezer&quot; gives the girl $10 and drops her off, thinking she'll &quot;need a reason to live tonight.&quot;\n\nThe Gourds' ballads have always been witty and danceable, but on Haymaker! the lyrics have more emotional range than ever before. &quot;I know the way you can get, when the soul hears a lonely sound,&quot; Russell croons in his raspy tenor. It's a line that could easily come off as too emotive, but the swinging string-groove propping the lyrics up turns the song into a barn-raising dance. That's just what the Gourds do best: throw a kick-ass party and discuss the meaning of life while they're at it. Haymaker! suggests they're less cynical than in previous years. It's a welcome shift. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2012/02/18/the-gourds/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731f9fc7b3a8845fc0734699f9b1b20c3f7d9a41","amp;dn":"The+Gourds...Haymaker%21%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731f9fc7b3a8845fc0734699f9b1b20c3f7d9a41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,31,159,199,179,168,132,95,192,115,70,153,249,177,178,12,63,125,154,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
