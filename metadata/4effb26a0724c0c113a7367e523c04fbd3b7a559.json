Making Movies was the biggest selling album in Italy in 1981 with one million copies; in Europe the album sold 3.8 million copies.\n\nIt was remastered and released with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the U.S. and on September 19, 2000 in the United States.\n\nThe songs &quot;Making Movies&quot; and &quot;Suicide Towers&quot; were recorded during the sessions and were never officially released.
