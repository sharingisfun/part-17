It premiered on August 17, 2006, immediately after the conclusion of UFC Fight Night 6. The finale was aired on November 11, 2006.\n\nThis series featured a change from the usual Ultimate Fighter format. Instead of UFC hopefuls, the cast was composed of fighters that had fought in the UFC but had yet to win a UFC title. The winners in the middleweight and welterweight divisions earned a UFC title shot in their division and a $100,000 purse, along with a $100,000 sponsorship deal with Xyience. Instead of coaches, prominent trainers and UFC fighters acted as advisors. Randy Couture, Georges St. Pierre, Marc Laimon, the grappling instructor from seasons 1 and 2, and Mark DellaGrotte, Kenny Florian's kickboxing trainer, were the advisors. The cast still lived in seclusion in the Las Vegas house.\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: H264 @ 872 kbps\nResolution: 640 x 480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\n\nAUDIO: AAC @ 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b99a4b8f0c84bdb18190388841276fcbd820af5b","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Fighter+04+-+The+Comeback","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b99a4b8f0c84bdb18190388841276fcbd820af5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,154,75,143,12,132,189,177,129,144,56,136,65,39,111,203,216,32,175,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
