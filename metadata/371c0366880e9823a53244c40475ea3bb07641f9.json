When Britain entered the war, two-thirds of all Britain's food was imported - and now it was under threat from a Nazi blockade. To save Britain from starvation, the nation's farmers were tasked with doubling food production in what Churchill called 'the frontline of freedom'. This meant ploughing up 6.5 million acres of unused land - a combined area bigger than the whole of Wales.\nDue to audio problems with the last upload of this release , i have re-done it from the DVD , SO THIS IS A NEW UPLOAD\n\n\n\n7)  Part 7 \nThe team face the farming conditions of 1944, when Britain had been at war for five long years and the fields surrounding Manor Farm filled up with thousands of troops as the Allies assembled the largest naval task force in history for the D-Day landings. Farmers did their bit by growing vast amounts of flax, which was used to make parachute webbing, fighter aircraft fuselages, tents and ropes, with production in Britain increasing from 1,000 acres to 60,000. But the wettest summer for a century has devastated the crop at Manor Farm, and if Alex and Peter are to save it they must take drastic action. The war brought farmers face to face with the military as never before, and artist Leo Stevenson follows in the footsteps of the war artists commissioned by the government to capture the wartime landscape on canvas. As D-Day drew ever closer, 3.5 million troops packed into southern England. Foreign troops formed close bonds with the locals, drinking together and playing games. The team recreate a baseball game that the Americans played here in 1944 and conclude that the villages of Britain had never been so vibrant.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1222/wartimefarmscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/4766/wartimefarmscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/3338/wartimefarmscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/6236/wartimefarmscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2343/wartimefarmscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2118/wartimefarmscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/5361/wartimefarmscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/9240/wartimefarmscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2865/wartimefarmscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1578 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59mins\n * Number Of Parts: 8\n * Part Size: 745 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wartimefarm.co.uk/the-farm-at-war/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:371c0366880e9823a53244c40475ea3bb07641f9","amp;dn":"BBC+Wartime+Farm+7of8+DVDrip+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"371c0366880e9823a53244c40475ea3bb07641f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,28,3,102,136,14,152,35,165,50,68,196,4,117,234,59,176,118,65,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
