Each episode proves a point.\n\nThe series concentrates on the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsecret societiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ impacts on our lives and how our souls are completely hypnotized by them. It also concentrates on common religious grounds between Muslims, Christians and Jews. The series goes to the olden times of Jesus Christ and pharaohs.\n\nThe movie takes the help from the Holy Qur'an, the Bible and the Torah. Each claim is well supported by documented facts that are well explained in the series. The series also brings many conspiracy theories to light which are prevalent these days. It analyses the advent of the new world order and the motives of the group that want it to be put into practice.\n\nThe series doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only address the Muslims but it is an invitation to truth to all humankind. The series is not to propagate the Muslim point of view about things rather it supports its claims from the holy books shared by the Jews and the Christians. The Arrivals just does that thing by using a style thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s welcoming and eye-opening for the truth seekers.\n\nThe Arrivals is a Joint Production by Truthseekers, Noreagaaa and Achernahr.\nWork Inspired by Hashemsfilms and of Course the Words of the Noble Qur'an, The Holy Bible, and The Torah.\n\nThe series is not copyrighted so you are free to distribute it to your friends and family so that the message of peace and truth can be spread to the mankind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc73f32f0aa298dabd541225386718e9e0fd46a9","amp;dn":"The+Arrivals+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc73f32f0aa298dabd541225386718e9e0fd46a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,115,243,47,10,162,152,218,189,84,18,37,56,103,24,233,224,253,70,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
