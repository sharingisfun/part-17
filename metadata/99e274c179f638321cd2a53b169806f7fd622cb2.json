The real footwork, however, unravels something less comforting than a mere &quot;Hoax.&quot;\n\n&quot;Sweet Misery&quot; is the working title of a documentary released by Sound and Fury in June of 2004. Our primary investigation includes interviews with doctors, lawyers, people who have had health problems which they associate with aspartame usage, advocates, and many others.\n\n&quot;Aspartame is inherently, markedly and uniquely unstable in aqueous media&quot; is a quote from the congressional record in 1985, and yet it was approved for use in soft drinks and other beverages.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nIs there credible evidence if you look beyond the smokescreen of corporate medicine? The primary research and interviews have been quite disturbing.\n\nDr. Woodrow C. Monte wrote: &quot;Methanol [one of the breakdown products of aspartame] has no therapeutic properties and is considered only as a toxicant. The ingestion of two teaspoons is considered lethal in humans&quot; (Monte, Woodrow, &quot;Aspartame: Methanol and the Public Health&quot;, Journal of Applied Nutrition, Vol. 36, Number 1, 1984, p. 44).\n\nThough it can hardly be considered good fortune to have an immediate reaction to aspartame, at least you are spared the potential long-term ticking time-bomb of a large array of neurological illnesses. These include, but are not limited to Brain Cancer, Lou Gehrig's Disease, Graves Disease, Chronic Fatigue, MS and Epilepsy.\n\nIn 1981 Donald Rumsfeld was CEO of Searle, makers of Aspartame.\n\nFilesize.....: 695.11MB\nRuntime......: 01:29:54\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 881 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\nFrame Size...: 640x480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99e274c179f638321cd2a53b169806f7fd622cb2","amp;dn":"Sweet+Misery+-+A+Poisoned+World+%28Aspartame%29+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99e274c179f638321cd2a53b169806f7fd622cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,226,116,193,121,246,56,50,28,210,165,59,22,152,6,247,253,98,44,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
