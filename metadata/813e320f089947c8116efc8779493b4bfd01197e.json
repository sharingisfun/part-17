Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction.\nThe battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest\nbidder gets the load.\n From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers\nwill haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they\nset out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.\n From rookie haulers to seasoned veterans, no shipment is too big for these\nprofessionals to handle. Marc Springer has been shipping less than a year but\nhe clearly has a knack for the business. He always manages to keep his 18-wheel\ntractor trailer full, and looks for nothing but the biggest, baddest loads he\ncan find. Rookie Jennifer Brennan may be new to the shipping world, but shes\nabout as tough and competitive as they come. She began her career transporting\nfarm animals across the country, but her typical shipments have expanded to be\njust about anything from a water buffalo to a million-dollar Ferrari. Jarrett\nJoyce has only been in the business for a few months, but hes never one to shy\naway from a unique load. Hes shipped everything from kittens to a hot dog stand\nto a Civil War cannon. Know-it-all Roy Garber has two years of experience under\nhis belt. A serious handyman, hes never found a load he couldnt tackle, and\nthis determination has made him one of the top earners in the country. Veteran\nshippers Scott and Suzanne Bawcom may seem like your typical suburban couple,\nbut they are anything but ordinary. A former bomb squad specialist, Scott spent\nhis pre-shipping days defusing bombs in Iraq for the Marines, and hes not the\nkind of guy to run away from a challenge. For the Bawcoms, shipping is a family\nbusiness. While Scott hauls shipments across the country, Suzanne bids and\nbooks loads constantly.\n Shipping Wars is produced by Megalomedia for A&amp;E Network. Executive producer\nis Jonathan Nowzaradan. Co-executive producers are Tom Mireles, Jeff Keels and\nGraham Davidson. A&amp;E executive producers are David McKillop, Elaine Frontain\nBryant and Neil A. Cohen.
