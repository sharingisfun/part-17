Producer Don Boyd brought together 10 of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most revered directors in order to pay homage to the opera with this episodic feature. Each director was asked to choose an aria from an operatic work and create a short film inspired by the emotions and intensity of the music rather than merely re-creating the opera itself. True to form, the result is a bizarre, moving, and broad work of entertainment. Standouts include Charles SturridgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s haunting LA VIRGINE DEGLI ANGELI, which follows a group of adolescents who steal a car and meet an early demise; Jean-Luc GodardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ARMIDE, an abstract visual tour de force that incorporates nude females floating around bodybuilders in midworkout; Franc RoddamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s somber LIEBESTOD, which watches a young couple spending one last night in a Las Vegas hotel room; Derek JarmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nostalgic DEPUIS LE JOUR, a moving ode to a life well lived; and Ken RussellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stimulating NESSUN DORMA, which breathes fresh life into the moment just before one dies. The directors use the works of their chosen composer--including Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Wagner, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Erich Korngold, Jean Philippe Rameau, Giacomo Puccini, Gustave Charpentier, and Ruggiero Leoncavallo--to tell stories about life, love, and loss as they feel it on a personal level, making ARIA more than just a sheer exercise in style.
