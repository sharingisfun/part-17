It was released in 1973. The bonus track Homage To The God Of Light was originally released in Peter Bardens's solo album The Answer in 1970.\n   The record was not a success and the band moved to the Deram Records division of Decca Records (UK).\n\nIn 1974 they released their second album; the critically acclaimed Mirage, on which Latimer showed he was also adept on flute. Although failing to chart at home, it gained success on the U.S. west coast, prompting a three-month tour there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393673521a2756d30e1e5029421834a99b900b82","amp;dn":"Camel+-+Camel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393673521a2756d30e1e5029421834a99b900b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,54,115,82,26,39,86,211,14,30,80,41,66,24,52,169,155,144,11,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
