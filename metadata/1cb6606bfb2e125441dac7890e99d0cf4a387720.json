They met in elementary school and began performing together as high school students in Decatur, Georgia, part of the Atlanta metropolitan area. They started performing with the name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIndigo GirlsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as students at Emory University, performing weekly at The Dugout, a bar in the Emory Village.\n\nThey released a self-produced, full-length record album in 1987 and contracted with a major record company in 1988. After releasing nine albums with major record labels from 1988 through 2007, they have now resumed self-producing albums with their own IG Recordings company.\n\nOutside of working on Indigo Girls related projects, Ray has released solo albums and founded a non profit organization that promotes independent musicians, while Saliers is a entrepreneur in the restaurant industry as well as a professional author. Both Saliers and Ray self-identify as lesbian and are active in political and environmental causes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrange Fire 1987\n\n\nStrange Fire is the first full-length album by folk rock duo Indigo Girls. It was originally released independently in 1987, then rereleased by Epic Records on October 10, 1989. &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;, which was left off the Epic Records album, was later released on the album Indigo Girls. &quot;High Horse&quot; has never been rereleased.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Strange Fire&quot;\n2.\t&quot;Crazy Game&quot;\n3.\t&quot;Left Me a Fool&quot;\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Wanna Know&quot;\n5.\t&quot;Hey Jesus&quot;\n6.\t&quot;Get Together&quot; (Chet Powers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n7.\t&quot;Walk Away&quot;\n8.\t&quot;Make It Easier&quot;\n9.\t&quot;You Left It Up to Me&quot;\n10.\t&quot;Land of Canaan&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigo Girls 1989\n\n\nIndigo Girls is the second studio album by Indigo Girls. It was released in 1989 on Epic Records. The album received excellent critical reviews, and went gold after six months and eventually went platinum. The duo was nominated for a Best New Artist Grammy (losing to Milli Vanilli), and won one for Best Contemporary Folk Recording. It was reissued in 2000 with two bonus tracks.\n\nMichael Stipe sang on Kid Fears, and the other members of R.E.M. performed on Tried To Be True. As well, the Irish band Hothouse Flowers backed the duo on several tracks.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Closer to Fine&quot; (Emily Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n2.\t&quot;Secure Yourself&quot; (Amy Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n3.\t&quot;Kid Fears&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n4.\t&quot;Prince of Darkness&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:21\n5.\t&quot;Blood and Fire&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n6.\t&quot;Tried to Be True&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n7.\t&quot;Love's Recovery&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n8.\t&quot;Land of Canaan&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n9.\t&quot;Center Stage&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n10.\t&quot;History of Us&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwamp Ophelia 1994\n\n\n\nSwamp Ophelia is the fifth studio album by the Indigo Girls, released in 1994.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fugitive&quot; (Amy Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n2.\t&quot;Least Complicated&quot; (Emily Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n3.\t&quot;Language or the Kiss&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n4.\t&quot;Reunion&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n5.\t&quot;Power of Two&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:22\n6.\t&quot;Touch Me Fall&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11\n7.\t&quot;The Wood Song&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:13\n8.\t&quot;Mystery&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n9.\t&quot;Dead Man's Hill&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n10.\t&quot;Fare Thee Well&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n11.\t&quot;This Train Revised&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll That We Let In 2004\n\n\n\nAll That We Let In is the ninth studio album by the Indigo Girls, released in 2004.

In fact, its melodies, harmonies, and arrangements are so ingratiating that the album carries the weight of an instant classic.&quot;[citation needed] Thom Jurekof from Allmusic wrote: &quot;part of an emotional journey as complete as can be. More relevant than anyone dared expect. It's accessible and moving and true. It's their own brand of rock &amp; roll, hewn from over the years, that bears a signature that is now indelible. A moving, and utterly poetic offering.&quot;[citation needed] And David Sprague from Barnes and Noble called it &quot;an emotional journey as complete as can be&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Pendulum Swinger&quot; (Emily Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n2.\t&quot;Little Perennials&quot; (Amy Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n3.\t&quot;I Believe in Love&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n4.\t&quot;Three County Highway&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n5.\t&quot;Run&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n6.\t&quot;Rock and Roll Heaven's Gate&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14\n7.\t&quot;Lay My Head Down&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n8.\t&quot;Money Made You Mean&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n9.\t&quot;Fly Away&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n10.\t&quot;Dirt and Dead Ends&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n11.\t&quot;All the Way&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n12.\t&quot;They Won't Have Me&quot; (Ray) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n13.\t&quot;Last Tears&quot; (Saliers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoseidon &amp; The Bitter Bug 2009\n\n\nPoseidon and the Bitter Bug is the eleventh studio album by Indigo Girls, released on March 24, 2009 by Vanguard Records.
