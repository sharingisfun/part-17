Bulte, Michel M.J. Modo (Springer, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nThe current generation of imaging nanoparticles is diverse and dependent on its myriad of applications. This book provides an overview of how these imaging particles can be designed to fulfill specific requirements for applications across different imaging modalities. It presents, for the first time, a comprehensive interdisciplinary overview of the impact nanoparticles have on biomedical imaging and is a common central resource for researchers and teachers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4a7aecaa33b56208cd47d9201713efe9f0fb0f","amp;dn":"Nanoparticles+in+Biomedical+Imaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4a7aecaa33b56208cd47d9201713efe9f0fb0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,74,122,236,170,51,181,98,8,205,71,217,32,23,19,239,233,240,251,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
