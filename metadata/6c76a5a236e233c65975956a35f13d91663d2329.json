As long as the non-offending team maintains possession, the referee allows play to continue and signals a delayed penalty by raising his arm.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Evan Mason, an NHL hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks. I spend my nights roughing up two hundred pound defensemen and, at times, spend more time in the penalty box than I do on the ice.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s my job. \n\nOne night changed everything I thought I once knew about my life on, and off, the ice.\n\nA girl. \n\nA brutally beaten girl left to die in an alley.\nI donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know why or how but something made me stay that night after taking her to the hospital. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know her, nor did I have an obligation to stay but something inside of me rooted me there telling me I should stay. Saving a life is worth something. At least I thought so. And I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been me if I just simply left her there. \n\nAny man who put his heart and soul into a game of hockey couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just walk away when someone needed them. She had no one else right now. The same guy who saw determination where there was desire, now saw hope where there was once despair.\n\nI couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave. That wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be me. No, not a man that put all he had into something some called just a game. I couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk away from her holding onto life, weak and powerless to something she had no control over.\n\nSo I stayed. In a room full of family members praying for their loved ones to pull through, I prayed for a girl I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know and had never met before, to have a beating heart. While othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sorrows turned to grieving pain, I sat waiting on the words of the unknown.\n\nNo bond is stronger than the ones youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bleed for.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c76a5a236e233c65975956a35f13d91663d2329","amp;dn":"Delayed+Penalty+%28Crossing+the+Line+%231%29+by+Shey+Stahl+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c76a5a236e233c65975956a35f13d91663d2329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,118,165,162,54,226,51,198,89,117,149,106,53,241,61,145,102,61,35,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
