They probably weren't because they're all demos,\nso the audio quality varies.\n\nI looked long and hard around the Internet for these earlier in the week,\nbut managed to find this and Volume 3.  I had some of Volume 2 from last year,\nwhich is why they're at 320K while the rest of these someone encoded \nat bit rates in the low 300s.  Doing these as lossless wouldn't have helped!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479ce08b6d6b0bd3690d7318648218b535f145e1","amp;dn":"ELTON+JOHN+%2F+Dick+James+Demos+--+Volume+1+and+some+of+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479ce08b6d6b0bd3690d7318648218b535f145e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,156,224,139,109,107,11,211,105,13,115,24,100,130,24,181,53,241,69,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
