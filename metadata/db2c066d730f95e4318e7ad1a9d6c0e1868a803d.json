Greene combined serious literary acclaim with wide popularity.\n\nAlthough Greene objected strongly to being described as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Catholic novelistÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rather than as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“novelist who happened to be Catholic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Catholic religious themes are at the root of much of his writing, especially the four major Catholic novels: Brighton Rock, The Heart of the Matter, The End of the Affair, and The Power and the Glory. Works such as The Quiet American, Our Man in Havana and The Human Factor also show an avid interest in the workings of international politics and espionage.\n\nGraham Greene - The Man Within.mp3 102.73 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Human Factor.mp3 132.95 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Honorary Consul.mp3 142.89 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Power and the Glory.mp3 125.6 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Quiet American.mp3 92.75 MBs\nGraham Greene - Travels with My Aunt.mp3 129.51 MBs\nGraham Greene - This Gun for Hire.mp3 102.25 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Third Man.mp3 46.42 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Heart of the Matter.mp3 137.89 MBs\nGraham Greene - The End of the Affair.mp3 89.83 MBs\nGraham Greene - Our Man in Havana.mp3 97.43 MBs\nGraham Greene - Monsignor Quixote.mp3 93.88 MBs\nGraham Greene - Brighton Rock.mp3 125.65 MBs\nGraham Greene - Stamboul Train.mp3 101.06 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Captain and the Enemy.mp3 54.28 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Confidential Agent .mp3 103.09 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Complete Short Stories of Graham Greene.mp3 275.41 MBs\nGraham Greene - The Comedians.mp3 162.4 MBs\nGraham Greene - A Burnt-out Case.mp3 98.91 MBs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db2c066d730f95e4318e7ad1a9d6c0e1868a803d","amp;dn":"Graham+Greene+%7E+The+Ultimate+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db2c066d730f95e4318e7ad1a9d6c0e1868a803d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,44,6,109,115,15,149,228,49,142,122,209,169,214,192,225,134,138,128,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
