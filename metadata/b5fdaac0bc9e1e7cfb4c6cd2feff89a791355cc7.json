But it turns out that the garage will have four fewer spaces than planned. In brutal Soviet style, the four least-well connected members are evicted from the cooperative in a mock vote, losing their entire investment. But one member, Malayeva, does the unthinkable. As if taking on the entire corrupt Soviet system, she quixotically locks down the meeting room and throws away the key. Chaos reigns through the night until the privileged are forced to negotiate for the first time in their lives. A madcap, rollicking, biting satire that Brezhnev banned.\n\nDirector: Eldar Ryazanov\nWriters: Emil Braginskiy, Eldar Ryazanov\n\nCast\nCast overview, first billed only:\n \tLiya Akhedzhakova\t ...\t\nMalayeva\n \tIya Savvina\t ...\t\nAnikeyeva\n \tSvetlana Nemolyaeva\t ...\t\nGuskov's Wife\n \tValentin Gaft\t ...\t\nSidorin\n \tGeorgiy Burkov\t ...\t\nVitaly Fetisov\n \tVyacheslav Nevinnyy\t ...\t\nKarpukhin\n \tAndrey Myagkov\t ...\t\nKhvostov\n \tLeonid Markov\t ...\t\nSmirnovsky\n \tIgor Kostolevskiy\t ...\t\nMiloserdov's Son\n \tOlga Ostroumova\t ...\t\nMarina\n \tAnastasia Voznesenskaya\t ...\t\nKushakova\n \tGleb Strizhenov\t ...\t\nYakubov\n \tBorislav Brondukov\t ...\t\nThe Groom\n \tSemyon Farada\t ...\t\nTrombon player\n \tNatalya Gurzo\t ...\t\nNatasha\n\nQuotes\n\n[Sidorin offers to expell Anikeeva] \nAnikeeva: What?
