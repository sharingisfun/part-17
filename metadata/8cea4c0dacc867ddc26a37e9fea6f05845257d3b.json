The album is musically similar to Dave Vanian and Captain Sensible&amp;#039;s previous Damned collaboration, Strawberries. It uses a combination of modern sampling and looping (&quot;Absinthe&quot;), gothic rock (&quot;Thrill Kill&quot;), punk rock (&quot;Obscene&quot; and &quot;Amen&quot;), deep gothic piano pieces (&quot;Beauty Of The Beast&quot; and &quot;The End Of Time&quot;), and more traditional pop songs.\n\nSongs like &quot;W&quot; (about the 2000 election and George W. Bush) have a sound very reminiscent of Britpop (such as the sound they exhibited on Strawberries). &quot;Song.Com&quot; offers a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the Internet, while &quot;Democracy?&quot; offers a rebuke of what they see as the futility of democracy and political revolution.\n\n\nTrack Listing: 1. &quot;Democracy?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:22\n2. &quot;Song.Com&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:39\n3. &quot;Thrill Kill&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:37\n4. &quot;She&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:27\n5. &quot;Lookin&amp;#039; For Action&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:04\n6. &quot;Would You Be So Hot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:13\n7. &quot;Absinthe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:18\n8. &quot;Amen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 7:55\n9. &quot;Neverland&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:31\n10. &quot;The End Of Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 3:53\n11. &quot;Obscene&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:46\n12. &quot;W&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 5:06\n13. &quot;Beauty Of The Beast&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 4:44\n\nBit Rate: 160kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cea4c0dacc867ddc26a37e9fea6f05845257d3b","amp;dn":"The+Damned+-+Grave+Disorder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cea4c0dacc867ddc26a37e9fea6f05845257d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,234,76,13,172,200,103,221,194,106,55,233,254,166,240,88,69,37,125,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
