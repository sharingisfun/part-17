It was produced entirely in a Rome hotel room, where Vangelis was staying to witness the filming of the Roman Polanski film Bitter Moon. It can be seen as a concept album in many respects, citing concepts from urban life and alluding to the big city atmosphere.\nVangelis plays all instruments, exclusively synthesizers and drum machines. Vocals are by various guest artists, with narrative by Roman Polanski and Emmanuelle Seigner. Vangelis employs a wide range of styles, from jazz (2) and rock (3) to new age (5, 6). Instrument patches are all synthesizer-based, but sound very convincing (trumpet on 1, guitar on 3, cello on 8).\n\nVoices is a 1995 album by Vangelis.\n\nIts music was used in the soundtrack for the 1998 documentary Deep Seas, Deep Secrets co-produced by The Learning Channel and Discovery Channel, together with music from Vangelis next album, Oceanic.\n\nThe track &quot;Ask the Mountains&quot; was also used as the music for the TV commercial for the Hotpoint/Ariston Aqualtis washing machine.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
