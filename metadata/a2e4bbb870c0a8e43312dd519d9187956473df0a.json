In order for this to happen, the argument champions eating locally and sustainably and encourages those with the resources to grow their own food. Further examining the question of what to eat from the perspective of both human and environmental health, the account goes beyond health choices and discusses potential moral issues from eatingÃ¢â‚¬â€or not eatingÃ¢â‚¬â€animals. Through the deeply personal narrative of someone who practiced veganism for 20 years, this unique exploration also discusses alternatives to industrial farming, reveals the risks of a vegan diet, and explains why animals belong on ecologically sound farms.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2e4bbb870c0a8e43312dd519d9187956473df0a","amp;dn":"The+Vegetarian+Myth%3A+Food%2C+Justice%2C+and+Sustainability+-+Lierre+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2e4bbb870c0a8e43312dd519d9187956473df0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,228,187,184,112,192,168,228,51,18,221,81,157,145,135,149,100,115,223,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
