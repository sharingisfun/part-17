His solo hits include &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;, Dirty Laundry and &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;. In 2008, he was ranked the 87th greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nHenley has also played a founding role in several environmental and political causes, most notably the Walden Woods Project. Since 1994, he has divided his musical activities between the Eagles and his solo career. He is known for his rusty, raw voice that is instantly recognizable. Henley also has a wide vocal range displayed in Eagles songs such as &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; and, &quot;Sad Cafe&quot;; the notes are possibly in countertenor range.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c059169fd856aeb538174c696f9b65e6d4d2b5","amp;dn":"Don+Henley-The+Very+Best+Of+Don+Henley-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c059169fd856aeb538174c696f9b65e6d4d2b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,192,89,22,159,216,86,174,181,56,23,76,105,111,155,101,230,212,210,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
