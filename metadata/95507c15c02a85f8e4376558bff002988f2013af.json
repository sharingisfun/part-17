If you\ndo not enjoy the kind of unplugged music, this is definitely a bad choice because it would not\nfavor you at all. But if you like version of acoustic music, you still need to get familiar with Yes\nmusic before seeing this DVD. Why? It's quite difficult to start liking Yes from their live\nacoustic music because you have definitely missed its original sound.\n\nFor me personally, I actually do not like unplugged music. No wonder when my rockin's friend\nwho currently live in Swiss, Krisna Dhianta, brought this DVD set as a gift for me I did not spin\nit right away because I know that I would not enjoy it. Couple of weeks after the DVD with me,\nI finally got a chance to spin and .. guess what? It did not bite me at all .. it was so dull to my\nears, I mean it. So, I just put it at my shelf. This happened quite a long ago (since the DVD\nwas released) until last week. The trigger was simple: I was preparing a material to be\nbroadcasted at FM Radio Network [Trijaya] down here at my country in the Satrurday Night\nRock when I would feature YES as a legendary band to discuss. As I was so busy preparing\nthe playlist and reading many books [including YES Stories] finally I found this DVD again at\nmy shelf. So I did try to spin .. and do you know what happened? It gave me different kind of\nexperience and I started appreciating this DVD!\n\nPut it this way . I have been hearing the music of YES since I was 14 years old with\n&quot;Roundabout&quot; as the first track. I have known exactly all subtleties pertinent to this song right\nfrom the elegant acoustic guitar opening until the heavy rhythm art and guitar / keyboard\nsolos during interlude. Oh yes, I have known it for so long. All details have resided in my\nmemory cells. But this time what I'm watching is &quot;totally different&quot; style of music for the same\nsong. It gives me unique experience. Judging from the performance of the band itself, I don't\nthink this is the best live performance they have played ever. But, for sure, this is their first\nunplugged version ever!\n\n&quot;Southside of The Sky&quot; is also another song that I have known it quite well the subtleties of\neach segment event during Rick's piano solo. But, listening to the other style gives me great\nexperience. In fact the piano solo by Rick Wakeman in this track is very intricate and\ninteresting for my ears.\n\nOverall, it's an excellent addition to any prog music collection. Keep on proggin' ..!\n\nPeace on earth and mercy mild - GW\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/24731217716657931472.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/24731217716657931472.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/52691860521911867899.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/52691860521911867899.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/10464806257764132617.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/10464806257764132617.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/92821309266519070248.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/92821309266519070248.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64239448635967390068.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/64239448635967390068.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/01944461805680736908.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/01944461805680736908.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJon Anderson: vocals, guitar, percussion\nSteve Howe: guitar, vocals\nRick Wakeman: keyboards\nChris Squire: bass, vocals\nAlan White: drums\n\n\nDVD/Video, released in 2004\n\nSongs / Tracks Listing\n\n01.
