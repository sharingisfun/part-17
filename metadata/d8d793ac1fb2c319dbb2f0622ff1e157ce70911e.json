Lipson | ISBN: 0521493455 | 2010 | PDF | 590 pages | 16,8 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThis fourth edition of a well-established textbook takes students from fundamental ideas to the most modern developments in optics. \nIllustrated with 400 figures, it contains numerous practical examples, many from student laboratory experiments and lecture demonstrations. \nAimed at undergraduate and advanced courses on modern optics, it is ideal for scientists and engineers. The book covers the principles of geometrical \nand physical optics, leading into quantum optics, using mainly Fourier transforms and linear algebra. Chapters are supplemented with advanced topics and \nup-to-date applications, exposing readers to key research themes, including negative refractive index, surface plasmon resonance, phase retrieval in \ncrystal diffraction and the Hubble telescope, photonic crystals, super-resolved imaging in biology, electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light and \nsuperluminal propagation, entangled photons and solar energy collectors.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d793ac1fb2c319dbb2f0622ff1e157ce70911e","amp;dn":"Optical+Physics+4+edition%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d793ac1fb2c319dbb2f0622ff1e157ce70911e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,215,147,172,31,178,195,25,219,178,240,98,47,241,225,87,206,112,145,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
