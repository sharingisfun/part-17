From the mysterious lost stories of Jesus to the greatest escape in history, National Geographic examines the fundamental questions surrounding the ancient texts to shed new light on old mysteries.\n\n\n1)  Lost Cities of the Bible (2006) \nThey're some of the most chilling stories in the Bible: tales of legendary cities destroyed by the hand of God. Are they truth or are they fiction?\n\n2)  Secret Lives of Jesus (2006) \nFifteen hundred years ago, someone buried ancient writings that told strange and unconventional stories about Jesus of Nazareth-tales considered the height of heresy. Discovered within the last century, these texts invite more questions than answers. Secret Lives of Jesus examines these mysterious lost stories of Christ, and other apocryphal texts, exploring the fundamental questions surrounding the texts.\n\n3)  Secret Lives of the Apostles (2012) \nIn a mere three or four decades, the seeds of a global religion spread across the most powerful empire on Earth. In an age with no internet, no mass media, no planes, trains or fossil fuel-how did it happen? NGC investigates the mysterious decades following Jesus' death, and the group of 12 common men, who sacrificed everything to spread Jesus' message.\n\n4)  Exodus Revealed (2008) \nIn the book of Exodus, Moses triggers a series of terrible plagues on Egypt and parts the Red Sea to lead the enslaved Israelites to freedom. Are there any scientific explanations for such strange events?\n\n5)  Search for the Head of John the Baptist (2012) \nIt is potentially one of the greatest archaeological discoveries in the history of Christianity, the ruins of one of the oldest monasteries in Europe. Here, under the location where the altar once stood, scientists have dug up an exquisite marble box holding what they believe to be the bones of John the Baptist, the man who baptized Jesus. If the date of the bones lines up with the Bible's profile of John, could it finally solve the mystery of what happened to his remains after his beheading, 2,000 years ago?\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c489a5adaa8488f7eaf5&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 2658 Kbps\n * Video: Resolution: 1024 x 576\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 160 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 46mins average\n * Framerate: 29.971fps\n * Number of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 869 MB average\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVDRip\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ad764f6afa0cb6a0937a6134144cb7a2fe5ac1","amp;dn":"Biblical.Mysteries.2of5.Secret.Lives.of.Jesus.576p.DVDRip.x264.A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ad764f6afa0cb6a0937a6134144cb7a2fe5ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,173,118,79,106,250,12,182,160,147,122,97,52,20,76,183,162,254,90,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
