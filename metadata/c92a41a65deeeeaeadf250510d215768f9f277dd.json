Where being different is the rule, &quot;ratting&quot; the gambling vice of a city's underground, and death is often around the next corner. Here is where mystery, intrigue, and suspense are more than a game to the residents of post Victorian London, it's a way of life.\n\nBaker Street, the name conjures up many images, mainly of Victorian London and the home of Sherlock Holmes. You won't find Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuths here, just some similarities yet a little bit more. A Sherlockian adventure set in an alternative but present day London. An England where World War II never happened and the Victorian era is resurrected into present day values. All of which only is the backdrop of the mysteries and a setting to clash with London's punk subculture.\n\nBaker Street, a violent intrusion into a world that doesn't exist but possibly could have. It is a story of rebellion yet also one of belonging. It dives deep into a world on the fringe and exposes it's underbelly and treats the normal world as the outside . It is Baker Street and no, you won't find Holmes or Watson here but you will find Harlequin, Sam, Susan, Toby, Toller, the Ripper, and far too many other fascinating characters to list.\n\n\nThis torrent is missing a few issues, if you can scan/point me in the direction of these issues (5, 7, 9. 10 and if possible a scan of 8 that isn't so brown), that would be great. A Caliber Christmas and Caliber Presents #9 stories are both included in Baker Street Graffiti\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_(comics)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_(comics)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.readaboutcomics.com/2003/07/10/honour-among-punks-the-complete-baker-street/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.readaboutcomics.com/2003/07/10/honour-among-punks-the-complete-baker-street/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.garyreed.net/BakerStreet/bakerstreetAbout.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.garyreed.net/BakerStreet/bakerstreetAbout.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nBaker Street 01 - Honour Among Punks, Act I - The Baskervilles.cbr\t15.1 MB\t\nBaker Street 02 - Honour Among Punks, Act II - Pride and Prejudice.cbr\t14.8 MB\t\nBaker Street 03 - Honour Among Punks, Act III - A Jaded View.cbr\t28.9 MB\t\nBaker Street 04 - Honour Among Punks, Act IV - The Gang's Afoot.cbr\t37.5 MB\t\n\nBaker Street 06 - Children of the Night, Act I - Sisters.cbr\t54.7 MB\t\nBaker Street 08 - Children of the Night, Act III - London After Midnight.cbr\t71.4 MB\t\n\nBaker Street Graffiti.cbr\t19.4 MB\t\nBaker Street Sketchbook.cbr\t25.2 MB\t\nCaliber Presents 04 - Honour Among Punks - Overture.cbz\t53.2 MB\t\nCaliber Summer Special 01.cbr\t47.0 MB\t\nNegative Burn #25 - The Empty House.cbr\t41.7 MB\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c92a41a65deeeeaeadf250510d215768f9f277dd","amp;dn":"Baker+Street+-+Guy+Davis+%28all+I+could+get%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c92a41a65deeeeaeadf250510d215768f9f277dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,42,65,166,93,238,238,174,173,242,80,81,13,33,87,104,249,242,119,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
