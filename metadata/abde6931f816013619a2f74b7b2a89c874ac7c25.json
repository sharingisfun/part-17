He is an atheist; she a Christian. He thought he had died; she thought she had given birth to Jesus. Both have temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nLike other forms of epilepsy, the condition causes fitting but it is also associated with religious hallucinations. Research into why people like Rudi and Gwen saw what they did has opened up a whole field of brain science: neurotheology.\n\nThe connection between the temporal lobes of the brain and religious feeling has led one Canadian scientist to try stimulating them. (They are near your ears.) 80% of Dr Michael Persinger's experimental subjects report that an artificial magnetic field focused on those brain areas gives them a feeling of 'not being alone'. Some of them describe it as a religious sensation. \n\n&quot;...a high probability [Ellen White] had temporal lobe epilepsy&quot; Prof Gregory Holmes, Dartmouth Medical School. His work raises the prospect that we are programmed to believe in god, that faith is a mental ability humans have developed or been given. And temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) could help unlock the mystery.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 49mn 0s 408ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 198 Kbps\nAspect            : 544 x 416 (1.308) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 116 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abde6931f816013619a2f74b7b2a89c874ac7c25","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+God+on+the+Brain+%282005%29+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abde6931f816013619a2f74b7b2a89c874ac7c25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,222,105,49,248,22,1,54,25,162,247,75,123,42,137,200,116,172,124,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
