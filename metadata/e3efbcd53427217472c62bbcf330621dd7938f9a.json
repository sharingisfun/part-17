A philosopher, mathematician, educational innovator, champion of intellectual, social and sexual freedom, and a campaigner for peace and human rights, he was also a prolific writer of popular and influential books, essays and lectures on an extensive range of subjects.\n\nConsidered to be one of the most controversial figures of the twentieth century, Bertrand Russell is widely renowned for his provocative writings. These definitive works offer profound insights and forward-thinking perspectives on a changing western society progressively shaped, most significantly, by two world wars, the decline of British imperialism and an evolving moral landscape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3efbcd53427217472c62bbcf330621dd7938f9a","amp;dn":"The+Basic+Writings+of+Bertrand+Russell+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3efbcd53427217472c62bbcf330621dd7938f9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,239,188,213,52,39,33,116,114,198,43,188,243,48,98,29,215,147,143,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
