The highly stylistic thriller tells the story of Julian (Gosling), a drug-smuggler thriving in Bangkok s criminal underworld, whose life gets complicated when his mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) compels him to find and kill whoever is responsible for his brother s recent death.\n\n\nOnly God Forgives is a continuation of the cinematic language started in Drive. The film features an amazing, dark and high energy score by Cliff Martinez who also composed the music for Drive and a selection of Thai pop songs. The film is mostly carried by images and music.\n\n\nPlease seed, and if you enjoyed, remember to support the artist by buying the album here: http://www.amazon.com/Only-God-Forgives-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B00COQU04O","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca235cb1bcb2660ea3a0c478b2a505820ded0bec","amp;dn":"Only+God+Forgives%3A+Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca235cb1bcb2660ea3a0c478b2a505820ded0bec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,35,92,177,188,178,102,14,163,160,196,120,178,165,5,130,13,237,11,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
