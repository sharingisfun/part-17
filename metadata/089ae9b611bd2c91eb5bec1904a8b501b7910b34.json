And among this secret society, where exiled Georgian aristocrats gather to indulge their carnal desires, fewer still can match the insatiable appetite of their chief provocateur, the mysterious Viscount Rohan.\n\nPursuit of physical pleasure is his both his preferred pastime and his most-pressing urge, until he encounters the fascination of a woman who wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be swayed. And while his dark seduction appalls the pure and impoverished Elinor Harriman, she finds herself intriguedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and secretly drawn to the man behind the desire.\n\n\nRECKLESS\nA most charming and passionate nihilist.\nAdrian Alistair Rohan lost his faith, and now, a dedicated member of the depraved Heavenly Host, he loses himself in his only pleasure: the seduction and debauchery of beautiful women. Rich, charming, and devastatingly skilled in the arts of love, he never fails in his conquestsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦until Charlotte Spenser.\n\nCharlotte is facing a desolate, passionless future, none of which matters to Adrian, who imagines her a toy until better prey arrives. But beneath her drab exterior, Charlotte is a woman as enchanting as she is brilliant and, lured into AdrianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s world, soon she becomes the seducer, and he the seduced.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nBREATHLESS\nA damaged beauty. The cruelest beast.\nRuined beyond repair and shunned by London society, lovely Miranda Rohan rebelliously embraces the freedom that comes from having nothing left to lose. However, this dangerous course throws her under the power of the darkly enigmatic Lucien de MalheurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½known to many as the Scorpion.\n\nSeeking to destroy the Rohans, Lucien traps Miranda in a marriage she thinks is based on friendship but instead is rooted in vengeance. Yet even when she realizes the truth, their enmity fuels a shocking passionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and perhaps even more.\nSuch a man might drive anyone to murderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\n\nSHAMELESS\nA long string of tragic loves haunts Viscount Benedick Francis Alistair Rohan. Cool and cynical, he's weary of life's fickle games and wants a prim and proper wife he can ignore while indulging his sensual appetites.\n\nLady Melisande Carstairs is nothing less than a tornado storming into Benedick's measured life. Possessed of boundless energy and the soul of a reformer, Melisande always conquers, whether it's saving the souls of soiled doves or seducing the man she's inconveniently fallen for. When she informs Benedick that his brother's newly revived Heavenly Host has graduated from simple carnal debauchery to sadistic violence, he's compelled to investigate, undercover. Under those covers, however, is Melisande herself, playing a dangerous game in the name of justice.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089ae9b611bd2c91eb5bec1904a8b501b7910b34","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Rohan+Collection++-++Anne+Stuart++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089ae9b611bd2c91eb5bec1904a8b501b7910b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,154,233,182,17,189,44,145,235,91,236,25,4,168,181,1,183,145,11,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
