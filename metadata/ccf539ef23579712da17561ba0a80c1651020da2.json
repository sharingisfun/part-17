And their hits Steppin' Out, Just Like Me, Hungry, Him or Me-What's It Gonna Be, and Kicks, in particular, are now seen by compilers as bold, unpretentious pieces of '60s rock &amp; roll with a defiant, punk edge. Paul Revere was born on January 7, 1938 in Harvard, NE. He learned to play the piano as a boy, and developed a keen appreciation for the work of Spike Jones &amp; His City Slickers. He joined his first real band while in his teens, and was later joined by 16-year-old Mark Lindsay (b. March 9, 1942), a singer/saxman who ended up replacing the group's vocalist. Called the Downbeats, they were popular at local dances, and cut a demo for Gardena Records in Los Angeles, where the company's owner was interested in issuing a record, but only if they changed their name. Revere's given name was such a natural as a gimmick that they became Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders. Their third single, a Jerry Lee Lewis-style instrumental, charted low in the Hot 100, and by the middle of 1963, they were one of the major music attractions in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Louie, Louie\n02.Louie - Go Home\n03.Steppin' Out\n04.Just Like Me\n05.Melody For An Unknown Girl\n06.Kicks (Sinle Version)\n07.Hungry\n08.The Great Airplane Strike\n09.Good Thing\n10.Ups And Downs\n11.Legend Of Paul Revere\n12.Action (Bonus Track)\n13.I'm Not Your Steppin' Stone (Bonus Track)\n14.Him Or Me - What's It Gonna Be (Bonus Track)\n15.Peace Of Mind (Bonus Track)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf539ef23579712da17561ba0a80c1651020da2","amp;dn":"Paul+Revere+%26+The+Raiders+-+Greatest+Hits+%282000%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf539ef23579712da17561ba0a80c1651020da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,245,57,239,35,87,151,18,218,23,86,27,160,168,12,22,81,2,13,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
