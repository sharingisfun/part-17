During one of their performances, the Four Horsemen invite a member of the audience to help them in their next trick: robbing a bank. The man is apparently teleported to his bank in Paris, where he activates an airduct which vacuums up the money and showers it onto the crowd in Las Vegas.\n\nFBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is called to investigate the theft and is partnered with Interpol Agent Alma Vargas (MÃƒÂ©lanie Laurent). They interrogate the Four Horsemen, but release them when no explanation for the theft can be found other than magic. Rhodes then meets Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), an ex-magician who makes money by revealing the secrets behind other magicians' tricks. Bradley was in the audience and deduced that the Four Horsemen stole the money weeks before, and manipulated the audience into believing it happened in real time.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78b3d01302484cb08fef64768359a22d6a0849fe","amp;dn":"Now+You+See+Me+CAM-XVIDv2-NoLogos.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78b3d01302484cb08fef64768359a22d6a0849fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,179,208,19,2,72,76,176,143,239,100,118,131,89,162,45,106,8,73,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
