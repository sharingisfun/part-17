One of the definitive text-sound compositions of the late 20th century, it has been called a comic opera about reincarnation.\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNothing less than the first American opera, written within an American language utilizing various American attention spans: snippets for the channel switchers, layers of meaning for the smart-alecks, something for everyone, and accessible. Works such as this put to rest any doubts if opera can or should survive, and how.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Fanfare (Allan Evans), March/April 1992\n\nPRODUCTION HISTORY\n\nPERFECT LIVES was developed musically through live performances in Europe and America. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Gene Tyranny was AshleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first collaborator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his keyboard melodies and harmonies define the character of Buddy. Tyranny and Ashley performed a chamber version of the piece many times together (including at The Kitchen in early 1978). Shortly after, The Kitchen commissioned PERFECT LIVES as an opera for television, the live version expanded to include richly layered orchestral tapes produced by composer Peter Gordon, and the singing of Jill Kroesen and David Van Tieghem. In 1980, John Sanborn recorded the basic video tracks on location in Illinois according to the templates provided by AshleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s score. From this material, The Lessons, a preview version of the opera (based on keyboard gestures by ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Gene Tyranny) was produced through the TV Lab at WNET.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, a pre-sale was obtained from Channel Four Television in Great Britain, making possible the completion of Perfect Lives. John Sanborn, the television director, designed an elaborate shooting and editing plan for the visual elements of AshleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s score. The post-production was completed this August (1983) at VCA Teletronics, under the supervision of Dean Winkler, who worked with Sanborn on image processing and was the videotape editor. Since its premiere on Great BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Channel Four in 1984 PERFECT LIVES has been broadcast throughout Europe and in various cities in the United States.\n\nPERFECT LIVES was produced with support from the National Endowment for the Arts (Media and Visual Arts Programs), the New York State Council on the Arts (Media Program), the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Beards Fund.\n\nOver the years Lovely Music has made various formats of PERFECT LIVES available: on audio cassette in 1984; on CD in 1991, for which the audio track was re-mastered by Allan Tucker at Foothill Digital; on VHS in 1994; and in 2005, on DVD, completely re-mastered at Blink Digital under the supervision of Dean Winkler, available in both NTSC and PAL.\n\nIn 1991, Burning Books (Santa Fe) published a hard cover edition of PERFECT LIVESÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ libretto, edited by Melody Sumner Carnahan, with Robert AshleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s commentary.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nPERFECT LIVES ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an opera for television by Robert Ashley\n\nI.\n\t\n\nThe Park (Privacy Rules)\n\nII.\n\t\n\nThe Supermarket (Famous People)\n\nIII.\n\t\n\nThe Bank (Victimless Crime)\n\nIV.\n\t\n\nThe Bar (Differences)\n\nV.\n\t\n\nThe Living Room (The Solutions)\n\nVI.\n\t\n\nThe Church (After the Fact)\n\nVII.\n\t\n\nThe Backyard (T'Be Continued)\n\nRaoul de Noget (No-zhay), a singer, and his friend, Buddy, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest Piano Player,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have come to a small town in the Midwest to entertain at The Perfect Lives Lounge. For some reason, unexplained, they have fallen in with two people from the town, Isolde (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnearing 30 and not yet spoken forÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and her brother, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œD,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ just out of high school and known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Captain of the Football TeamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (his parents call him Donnie), to commit the perfect crime, a metaphor for something philosophical: in this case, to remove a sizable amount of money from The Bank for one day (one day only) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlet the whole world know that it was missing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n            ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is currently Assistant to the Manager at The Bank. He learns that Gwyn, one of the tellers, intends to elope with his friend, Ed. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is asked to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcome alongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Dwayne, another friend, who has a problem speaking (that is, he speaks, but has trouble being understood.) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ knows the key to opening the safe. The plan is, then: to take away the money in EdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s car to Indiana (goal of the elopers), to keep it in circulation, as it were. They leave at 5 AM.\n\n            While the lovers are in passage, Raoul and Buddy, with BuddyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dogs, and, separately, Isolde enter The Bank at midday. The dogs create a ruckus (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlike a noise from HadesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) that gives Isolde the excuse to get a bucket of water from next door to throw at the dogs and miss and soak the Bank Manager, who goes into the safe for a change of clothes, only to discover that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Bank has no money in The Bank.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ As part of the plan, Isolde has phoned the SheriffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Office, disguising her voice (her father, Will, is the Sheriff; Ida is her mother) to report an accident ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œout on the highway.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ There is no ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œaccident,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of course, and, recognizing the meaning of the decoy, Will puts it all together later under IdaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s questioning. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too late.\n\n            Among the tellers (Jennifer, Kate, Eleanor, Linda, and Susie) who are witnesses to the dogfight and the terrible discovery and who understand what happenedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from different points of view, so to speak ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ only Susie noticed that the dogs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwent out together,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not telling. She fell for opera at first sight because of Buddy, who because of his fancy style of dress is often mistaken for a foreigner (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no doubt the Mexican is in it. The doubt is that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mexican.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) That was at 12:45 PM (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œremember that!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) And in The Bank at that time are Helen and John, innocent bystanders from The Home, doing business ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œon a holiday.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ That is, they have fallen in love (in The Home), but they are not allowed to marry, or one will ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlose the privileges.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So, every other weekend they take adjoining rooms at the motel right off The Park (where, by coincidence, Raoul and Buddy live, and where we first meet Raoul trying to order breakfast on the phone.) This is just the beginning of their weekend, and at 3 PM we see them in The Supermarket, shopping, a little jangled, set against each other by the excitement, but far from down and out.\n\n            Sometime later, probably Monday, in The Bar, Buddy and Raoul on their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œday off from musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have come to celebrate, little knowing that there they will meet Rodney, The Bartender, whose wife, Baby, aspires to Boogie Woogie, ceaselessly and without much success (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHappy she is the traveling salesmen say, but Boogie Woogie she is not.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) studying the video tapes (The Lessons) that Buddy takes around with him and distributes at the local music store wherever he is playing. Rodney is philosophical, especially about BabyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talents, but skeptical about Boogie Woogie. And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnow heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s met his nemesis...face to face.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ They talk.\n\n            Meanwhile, back in time (to the evening of the big day), Will and Ida, in The Living Room, solve the puzzle, perhaps even to the motive, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too late. Somewhere in Indiana, with the money hidden in the car (unknown to Gwyn, of course: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGwynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not guiltyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and certain of their success, Ed and Gwyn and Dwayne and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have found a Justice of the Peace who will perform the ceremony (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI handle speed traps, elopements, true signatures and the likeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and who recognizes in Gwyn something so urgent (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œand why is the Bride-to-be soÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½uhnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½what is the word?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), something so dramaticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½(She is a (pÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢)monkey, Sir.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that he is transported to somewhere in the past, to another ceremony, to another Bride-to-be (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLucille,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ who speaks in tongues), to a confusion of time and place where other (famous) marriages are enacted: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSnowdrift,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ abandoned at the altar; and so forth. And while we pause to eat the wedding cake, his humble situation (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œright off my bedroom is my officeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) is transformed before our very eyes into The Church (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe church of the great light.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) And we are satisfied.\n\n            Meanwhile, back in town, in The Backyard, a few friends and relatives have gathered, as usual in summer, to picnic, to celebrate the changing of the light at sundown. And watching from the doorway of her motherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house, Isolde counts the days.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCAST AND COLLABORATORS\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe collaborative aspect of the work follows principles I have used for many years in search of a new operatic style.

The musical and visual materials are coordinated through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“templatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a term I have come to use to describe the subjective assignment of emotional values and moods to visual forms and corresponding musical structures. Within the rules defined by the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“templatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the collaborators in all aspects of the work are free to interpret, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“improviseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, invent and superimpose characteristics of their own artistic styles onto the texture of the work.

He has influenced a generation of composers and artists working with new forms of music for the media.\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œElectronically innovative, socially provocative, and incorrigibly theatrical, Robert Ashley epitomizes the conceptualism of the 1960s, yet more than any other figure he has also transcended it. No other composer is so associated with, or recognizable by, his own voice: mellow, nonchalant, and invitingly husky, he has used it in almost every work. Only a handful of his mature compositions are instrumental, without text. Unlike his conceptualist colleagues, he has never put his musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emphasis primarily on technical gadgets or sonic phenomena. His works have often focused on sex, violence, and everyday life, and he is so fascinated by music as a social function that he has written, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe most radical redefinition of music that I could think of would be one that defines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ without reference to sound.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kyle Gann, American Music in the 20th Century, Schirmer Books, 1997\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOperas so vast in their vision that they are comparable only to WagnerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ring cycle or StockhausenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s continuing mystical seven-evening Licht cycle.
