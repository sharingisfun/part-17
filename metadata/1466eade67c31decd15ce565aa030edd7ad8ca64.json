It is the first game in the Jagged Alliance series, and was followed by Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games (1995) and Jagged Alliance 2 (1999).\n\nJagged Alliance takes place on the fictional south Atlantic island of Metavira, a former nuclear testing site. The nuclear tests altered some trees on the island, and several years later it was discovered by a scientist, Brenda Richards, that those trees, known as Fallow trees, produce unique sap that prove to be a medical marvel. However, Brenda also discovered that the trees could not reproduce. Her assistant, Lucas Santino, realized how profitable this sap would be and managed to convince Jack Richards, the leader of the scientific mission, that it would be beneficial to have two independent science teams, and consequently established a new base on the other side of the island. He immediately began to recruit new people and gradually took over the island by force.\n\nWhen the game begins, the player is contacted by Jack Richards and is invited to the island. There, Brenda and her father request that the player hires mercenaries through the Association of International Mercenaries (abbreviated in-game as 'A.I.M.') to reclaim the island from SantinoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s forces sector by sector.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis torrent includes both Jagged Alliance and Deadly Games.
