Though he was often derided at the time as a pale imitation of Bob Dylan, there isn't a lot of evidence here; true, he does cover a Woody Guthrie song (&quot;Car Car Riding in My Car&quot;) and gives it some twang worthy of the master, but his style is his own, slanted toward the mysticism of British folk less than the earthiness of its American cousin. Donovan summons the proper age-old weariness for &quot;Goldwatch Blues,&quot; gets a bit bluesy for &quot;You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond,&quot; and lets it all hang out for &quot;Keep on Truckin'.&quot;\n\nReview by John Bush @ Allmusic\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/whats-bin-did-and-whats-bin-hid-2007-r35804&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/whats-bin-did-and-whats-bin-hid-2007-r35804&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid is the debut album from Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. It was released in the United Kingdom four days after Donovan's 19th birthday on 14 May 1965, through Pye Records (catalog number NPL 18117). Terry Kennedy, Peter Eden, and Geoff Stephens produced the album. What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid was released in the United States as Catch the Wind on Hickory Records in June 1965. Hickory Records changed the title to match that of Donovan's debut single.\n\nIn late 1964, Peter Eden and Geoff Stephens offered Donovan a recording contract with Pye Records in the United Kingdom. Donovan had performed around Britain and had become well known in British folk circles before his record contract. His 1964 demo tapes (released as Sixty Four in 2004) show a great resemblance to both Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan, which probably prompted the &quot;British answer to Bob Dylan&quot; press line that was subsequently released. What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid is notable because it captures Donovan at a point where his style and vision were starting to significantly diverge from those of Guthrie and Dylan.\n\nThe music primarily consists of Donovan singing and playing mouth harp and acoustic guitar, much like his live performances of the time. He still had some vestiges of Woody Guthrie's style, and covers Guthrie's &quot;Riding in My Car (Car Song)&quot; here (retitled &quot;Car Car&quot;). What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid also includes British folk (&quot;Tangerine Puppet&quot;) and even some jazz (&quot;Cuttin' Out&quot;).\n\nDonovan rerecorded &quot;Catch the Wind&quot; for the album, which was initially released as his debut single in the United Kingdom on 12 March 1965.\n\nOther musicians featured on the album are Brian Locking on bass, Skip Alan (from the Pretty Things) on drums, and Gypsy Dave on kazoo.\n\nOn the 22nd January 2002, Sanctuary Records reissued the complete What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid for the first time on compact disc. The U.S. version of the CD titled Catch the Wind was released six years earlier. The CD features four bonus tracks. The first two tracks are Donovan's debut single &quot;Catch the Wind&quot; (a different take than the album track) and its b-side &quot;Why Do You Treat Me Like You Do?&quot;. The third bonus track &quot;Every Man Has His Chain&quot; was once a rare track in Donovan's discography, and was originally released on the French EP Catch the Wind in 1965. Donovan's second single &quot;Colours&quot; is also released here, in a version different from the one included on the Fairytale album.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Bin_Did_and_What%27s_Bin_Hid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Bin_Did_and_What%27s_Bin_Hid&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
