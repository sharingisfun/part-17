Shadows are gathering in the skies; a black heart of pure evil is bubbling with revenge; and it rather looks as if the Multiverse is about to come to an end, starting with Biddlecombe. When a new toy shopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening goes terrifyingly awry, Samuel must gather a ragtag band of dwarfs, policemen, and very polite monsters to face down the greatest threat the Multiverse has ever known, not to mention assorted vampires, a girl with an unnatural fondness for spiders, and highly flammable unfriendly elves.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader Ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e2175c2a1d82aa3790f099b751feb8ad748b58","amp;dn":"The+Creeps+by+John+Connolly+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e2175c2a1d82aa3790f099b751feb8ad748b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,226,23,92,42,29,130,170,55,144,240,153,183,81,254,184,173,116,139,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
