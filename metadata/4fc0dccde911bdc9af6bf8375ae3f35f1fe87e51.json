It vividly captures the band's recording career, packed with live footage, much of it previously unseen and their back catalogue of promo videos.\n\nFor all their imitators and admirers, no one has ever successfully cloned the unique and indefinable combination of elements that made Roxy Music one of the most influential bands in Rock music history. Now for the first time with the release of The Thrill Of It All, fans are given the opportunity to take a comprehensive look back at the career of a band that combined idiosyncratic experimentation, sophisticated wit and a highly developed visual presentation.\n\nWith memorable TV performances for singles like 'Virginia Plain', 'Do The Strand' and 'Pyjamarama', classic videos for tracks like 'Avalon' and 'Jealous Guy' and the unforgettable live recordings of tracks like 'Editions Of You' and 'Street Life', this DVD really demonstrates a band who triumphantly combined both style and substance.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDVD 1: 1972 - 1976\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nRe-Make / Re-Model (The Royal College Of Art, London) \t\t\nLadytron (The Old Grey Whistle Test, BBC Television) \t\t\nVirginia Plain (Top Of The Pops, BBC Television) \t\t\nFor Your Pleasure (Full House, BBC Television) \t\t\nDo The Strand (The Old Grey Whistle Test, BBC Television) \t\t\nIn Every Dream Home A Heartache (The Old Grey Whistle Test, BBC Television) \t\t\nEditions Of You (The Golden Rose Festival, Montreux)\t\t\nPyjamarama (Musikladen, German Television) \t\t\nAmazona (Musikladen, German Television) \t\t\nPsalm (Musikladen, German Television) \t\t\nAll I Want Is You (Top Of The Pops, BBC Television) \t\t\nLove Is The Drug (Supersonic, London Weekend Television) \t\t\nBoth Ends Burning (The Empire Pool, Wembley, London) \t\t\nThe Thrill Of It All (Konserthaus, Stockholm, Sweden) \t\t\nMother Of Pearl (Konserthaus, Stockholm, Sweden) \t\t\nNightingale (Konserthaus, Stockholm, Sweden) \t\t\nOut Of The Blue (Konserthaus, Stockholm, Sweden) \t\t\nStreet Life (Konserthaus, Stockholm, Sweden)\n\t\n\nDVD 2: 1979 - 1982\n---------------------------------------------------------------\t\nDance Away (ABBA In Switzerland, BBC Television) \t\t\nManifesto (Manchester Apollo, England) \t\t\nA Song For Europe (Manchester Apollo, England) \t\t\nStill Falls The Rain (Manchester Apollo, England) \t\t\nAin't That So (Manchester Apollo, England) \t\t\nAngel Eyes (Promotional Video) \t\t\nTrash (Promotional Video) \t\t\nOver You (Top Of The Pops, BBC Television) \t\t\nOh Yeah (On The Radio) (Top Of The Pops, BBC Television) \t\t\nSame Old Scene (Promotional Video) \t\t\nRain, Rain, Rain (Rockpop In Concert, German Television) \t\t\nFlesh And Blood (Rockpop In Concert, German Television) \t\t\nJealous Guy (Promotional Video) \t\t\nThe Main Thing (Frejus, France) \t\t\nWhile My Heart Is Still Beating (Frejus, France) \t\t\nAvalon (Frejus, France) \t\t\nMy Only Love (Frejus, France) \t\t\nMore Than This (Promotional Video) \t\t\n\nExtras:\n\nThe Main Thing (Promotional Video) \t\t\nAvalon (Promotional Video) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc0dccde911bdc9af6bf8375ae3f35f1fe87e51","amp;dn":"Roxy+Music+-+The+Thrill+Of+It+All+%282008%29+%5B2x+DVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc0dccde911bdc9af6bf8375ae3f35f1fe87e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,192,220,205,233,17,189,201,175,107,248,55,90,227,243,95,31,232,126,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
