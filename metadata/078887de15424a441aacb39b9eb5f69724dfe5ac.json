The magnificently sonorous introductory fanfare to La PÃ©ri immediately makes it plain that he is able to draw the best from his old orchestra, who play splendidly throughout for him. If one were tempted to ask whether, with 30 versions already in the current catalogue, another Apprenti sorcier was needed, the answer is supplied in this magisterial, deliberately but finely paced reading. Familiarity with the piece should not lessen our admiration for its superb scoring: this is a vivid performance, with a positively awesome return of the sorcerer after his apprentice's mayhem.\r\nDukas was so excessively self-critical of his compositions that he destroyed many before they could be published: he would also have cast away the exotic ''dance poem'' La PÃ©ri had it not been for the agonized intervention of his friends. It was premiered in 1912, though not by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, for which it had been intended: it is a score of sumptuous coloration illustrating the legend of a PÃ©ri who by her seductive dancing regains the flower of immortality from a Persian king who had snatched it from her. A highly poetic work: its huge climax is admirably captured in this spacious recording.\r\nIt is certainly time we had a new recording of Dukas's only surviving symphony (a second was discarded), for it is nearly 20 years since Martinon's performance (EMI, 7/74), musically excellent as that was. This is the earliest of the three works on this disc, and, being contemporary with Debussy's Nocturnes, points the dichotomy in French music in the last decade of the nineteenth century. The vigour of the well-reasoned first movement and the excitable finale (both of which reveal the influence of Franck) is offset by the pensive lyricism of the central Andante: though the symphony is over-extended, it is full of invention. Terrific playing and recording. Interestingly, the booklet analyses the structure of all the works and reinforces this by intermediate cues on the disc.&quot; --Lionel Salter\r\n\r\n1.
