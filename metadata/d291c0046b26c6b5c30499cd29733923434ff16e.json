After decades of rock magazines wallowing in the 60s and 70s, Classic Pop truly celebrates the explosion of creativity and diversity that shook up music in the late 70s, defined the sound of the 80s, and continues to influence today. Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New Wave, synth-pop, indie, ska or the New Romantics, Classic Pop  gives the artists and music in-depth coverage in a glossy, high-quality magazine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d291c0046b26c6b5c30499cd29733923434ff16e","amp;dn":"Classic+POP+-+September+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d291c0046b26c6b5c30499cd29733923434ff16e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,145,192,4,107,38,198,181,195,4,153,205,41,115,57,35,67,79,241,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
