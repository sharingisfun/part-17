But it&amp;#039;s not a\nbad idea to play one of those new ones at Bonnaroo;\nthat&amp;#039;s kind of a special show, so we may do that.&quot;\n\nFolds added that even with their massive crowds,\nfestivals such as Bonnaroo provide a sympathetic\nenvironment to try out new material. &quot;It&amp;#039;s a music\naudience, and that&amp;#039;s pretty impressive for the size of\nthe audience,&quot; he explains. &quot;The last time (at Bonnaroo\nin 2006) we played in front of a really large crowd and\nwe were playing mostly stuff off an album that&amp;#039;d just\nbeen released and it all felt pretty good [and] pretty\nmusical.&quot;\n\nAt shows already this year Folds has played a variety of\nsongs from the new album, his first since\n&quot;Supersunnyspeedygraphic&quot; in 2006. Among the titles have\nbeen &quot;Hiroshima,&quot; &quot;Errant Dog,&quot; &quot;Effington,&quot; &quot;The Bitch\nWent Nuts,&quot; &quot;Free Coffee&quot; and &quot;Kylie From Connecticut.&quot;\nThe album has no title yet, however.\n\n&quot;That&amp;#039;s going to be one of the last things, I think,\nthat&amp;#039;s going to fall together here,&quot; he said. &quot;I&amp;#039;m not\nreally sure. I may have a couple of ideas, but we&amp;#039;ve got\nsome really good stuff going for the artwork that I&amp;#039;m\nexcited about. So I kind of want to get that in order and\nsee if that helps me make up my mind.&quot;\n\nKnow for the wry sense of humor he infuses in his lyrics,\nFolds told the Bonnaroo call that he&amp;#039;s also looking\nforward to checking out some of the comedians who are\npart of the festival bill.\n\n&quot;I can relate to that because I&amp;#039;m a little bit of a\nclown,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;m like &amp;#039;Keystone\nCops&amp;#039; kind of clown. The last time I met Louis Black, and\nhe was really cool. We had a really good talk and it was\nfun. I get along with comedians well pretty well.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822d210c6d847f7d9b39d665c815810479720681","amp;dn":"Ben_Folds-Way_To_Normal-2008-BENFOLDS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822d210c6d847f7d9b39d665c815810479720681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,45,33,12,109,132,127,125,155,57,214,101,200,21,129,4,121,114,6,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
