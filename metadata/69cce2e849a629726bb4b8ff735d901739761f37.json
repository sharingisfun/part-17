He says: â€œThe brainâ€™s alright. The bodyâ€¦ Iâ€™m not too good walking. I donâ€™t think [hearing]is that important - better to have good eyesight.â€\r\n \r\nMeanwhile, Alan Higgins, 92, undertakes an epic journey. He wants to track down a girl he met 75 years ago during the war. He sets off with granddaughter Clara to Russia, through crowded cities and across frozen wilderness, facing the perils of the most dangerous roads in Europe, insisting he drive despite her reservations. He says: â€œWell, I donâ€™t know, I hope Iâ€™ll be able to drive up there. When I drove from Barry to here, I was the only car on the road, driving through all the hardened snow and what have youâ€¦ Snow is snow.â€\r\n \r\nJock Stares, 100, has had a lifelong love affair with motorcycles - and still goes out on his scooter every day. He bombs around the Gower Peninsula in Wales, visiting care homes to play classic piano tunes for what he describes as â€˜the old folk,â€™ despite the fact most are younger than he is. He says: â€œIâ€™ve always fallen in love with being on two wheels, itâ€™s the next best thing to being able to fly. Because you go through the cool air effortlessly. Itâ€™s like a drug really, you become addicted to it.â€\r\n \r\nThrill-seeking 95-year-old ex-commando Tom Lackey canâ€™t drive since he had a stroke and has to use a scooter, but now gets his kicks by taking to the air - wing-walking. He says: â€œI do feel very trapped, I do feel contained. It does make me feel like an old man when Iâ€™m in the scooter.\r\n \r\nâ€œI suppose anything you do up in the air especially standing on top of an aeroplane, youâ€™re taking a risk, but I appreciate that, and I suppose thatâ€™s part of the fun. The challenges are breathing properly and putting up with the air pressure against you.. The ladies will never need a facelift when theyâ€™ve had a wing walk, because you wonâ€™t have a crease left in your face.â€\r\n \r\nBack down on earth is 99-year-old Mary Ellis, who flew Spitfires in the Second World War before turning her hand to rally-driving. Sheâ€™s on a quest to track down her beloved Allard K1 rally car, and says: â€œWell, everything at 99 is that much slower. But only a teeny weeny bit.\r\n \r\nâ€œI can never ever forget the Allard, which was a soulmate, because it becomes part of [you]. I have missed it, Iâ€™ve missed it terribly. I still miss it and I do wish it was here. It would mean an awful lot if I could drive it again before I die because it would bring back so many lovely memories.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cce2e849a629726bb4b8ff735d901739761f37","amp;dn":"100.Year.Old.Drivers.2016.07.13.Rebooted.s03e01.EN.SUB.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69cce2e849a629726bb4b8ff735d901739761f37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,204,226,232,73,166,41,114,107,180,184,255,115,93,144,23,57,118,31,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
