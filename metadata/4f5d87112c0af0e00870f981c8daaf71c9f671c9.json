If it seems obvious to watch The Avengers last, the order of the other yet to be defined. \n\nWatching them in order of release? Captain America came out last and goes more than 60 years before the other films. Then movies Thor, Hulk and Iron Man 2 takes place during the same week, called the Fury's Big Week. Some passages are almost simultaneous, but different parts of the world (and the universe, counting Asgard). Finally, scenes intro and ending of Captain America are going after the other 4 movies. \n\nOur answer: a timeline of 6 films scenes. \n\nAfter several hours of editing, the video produced for nearly twelve hours, we decided to cut it into 10 &quot;episodes&quot; of about one hour with a 2 hour season finale concluding the whole. We respect the codes of a TV series, with a generic title and a different episode, the cutting being in tense moments of the Timeline to create expectation of the next episode. \n\nThe &quot;season 1&quot; corresponds to the films The Avengers and introducing concludes with the latter, we plan to ride next season with all films released between The Avengers and The Avengers 2\n\nvideo:\nWidth                            : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\n\naudio:\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels (5.1)\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage                         : French, English\nSubtitles                        : none\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5d87112c0af0e00870f981c8daaf71c9f671c9","amp;dn":"Avengers+Chronological+Edition+Remastered+%5B1080p+VF%2BVO+5.1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5d87112c0af0e00870f981c8daaf71c9f671c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,93,135,17,44,10,240,224,8,112,249,129,200,218,175,113,201,246,113,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
