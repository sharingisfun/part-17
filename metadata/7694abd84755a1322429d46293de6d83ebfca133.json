While the Reversing Module is maturing and being modified to make everything work fluidly. That being said the Penetration Testing Module is just that to get your feet wet.\n\nOk this time we are going to run a Beta test on this thing. There will be a lot of changes going into 11.8 and I want to make it all work (maybe even a scripting language change). That being said lets get started the modules have been renamed and are now called the correct name lol. Now, that being said the tools have been shown to reflect that including Havij. I take absolutely no responsibility for what you do with Havij as it serves to Pen-test websites. The Pen-Test module is very reflective use wise on you so its your responsibility what you do with it.\n\nI TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE USE OF PENETRATION TESTING TOOLS (There I said it)\n\nNow that being said I've put in a copy of Office 2013 Pro plus Sp1 as its basically nice to have in the OS. That means the foot print of the Image is higher so grab the USB 3.0 boys your going to need it. Ya this is a beta so no music this time that will be for the final when everything has been taken care of :)\n\nPlease Keep in mind this is a Beta it is an in progress product. That means you're here just to test it and provide feedback. The goal here is to emulate Kali Linux in terms of functionality.\nScreenshots","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7694abd84755a1322429d46293de6d83ebfca133","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+-+Dark+V11.8+-+x64+-+Black+Hats+-+Public+Beta+-+%28By+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7694abd84755a1322429d46293de6d83ebfca133","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,148,171,216,71,85,161,50,36,41,212,98,147,222,109,131,235,252,161,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
