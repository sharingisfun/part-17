It contains everything I could find single-wise off of random albums, and the internet.  Not again it's not everything.  But I think it's a good representation of music and audio for the Halloween season.  It has a few sound effects and random radio commercials (all fake of course) that I either found or made.  I also scoured the net and got as many halloween tracks from the Dr. Demento show as I could.  That collection spans 40 years and I grabbed it single by single.  It's all in one folder sorry folks I was lazy.  I tagged as much as I could get tagged, however some songs literally don't have albums, and some songs I don't know the year.  I think that's all.  I hope you all enjoy this. \n\nThe majority of songs is in \n\n128 KBPS 44.1 Stereo  however some files are a higher bitrate.  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d0b2362ccfc9b74488d68dc1fe84510422fc81d","amp;dn":"Halloween+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d0b2362ccfc9b74488d68dc1fe84510422fc81d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,11,35,98,204,252,155,116,72,141,104,220,31,232,69,16,66,47,200,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
