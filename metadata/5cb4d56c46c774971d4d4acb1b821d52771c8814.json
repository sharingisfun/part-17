Silver Trees (6:43)\n\n\n\nA quartet hailing from Chapel Hill, NC, the Kingsbury Manx make music in the classic English pop tradition. On its self-titled debut, the band seamlessly blends its home country's indie rock trappings with overseas influences. The Kingsbury Manx is the aural equivalent of a cozy winter fire, with English flavors cloaked in warm, humming organs, acoustic guitars, and tender melodies. It's an unassuming, musically whimsical, minor triumph.\nThroughout, the band spins quaint melodies that date back to the days when the concept record was the ultimate test of a group's possibilities as well as its limitations. The tunes have a ring of familiarity, although their sources cannot be directly traced. The Manx may have pilfered a book of Christmas carols for the opening &quot;Pageant Square.&quot; &quot;Fanfare,&quot; on the other hand, sounds like a slice of early Pink Floyd. On The Kingsbury Manx, these songs are of a piece with more modern material like the instrumental &quot;Blue Eurasians.&quot; This song is the indie rock equivalent of an aimless &quot;jam&quot; and can be equally indulgent and uncommunicative; however, the Manx keep a hand on the reigns and adhere to structure, ultimately sticking to a more passive ebb and flood of dynamics. The members have the sort of pedestrian voices common amongst the '90s wave of British groups like Ride and Slowdive. This suits the material fine, and only becomes a problem on one song -- beginning with an effortless interplay of cascading guitar tones which are kept as the song's backdrop, &quot;Piss Diary&quot; finds the vocalists singing a chorus of Simon &amp; Garfunkle-esque harmonies almost out of their range.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cb4d56c46c774971d4d4acb1b821d52771c8814","amp;dn":"The+Kingsbury+Manx+-+The+Kingsbury+Manx+%5B2000%5D++%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cb4d56c46c774971d4d4acb1b821d52771c8814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,180,213,108,70,199,116,151,29,77,74,203,27,130,29,82,119,28,136,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
