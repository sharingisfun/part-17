Andrew Lyon, Michael Joseph Serpe (Wiley-VCH, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-527-33033-1\r\n\r\nThe book provides experienced as well as young researchers with a topical view of the vibrant field of soft nanotechnology. In addition to\r\nelucidating the underlying concepts and principles that drive continued innovation, major parts of each chapter are devoted to detailed discussions of potential and already realized applications of micro- and nanogel- based materials. Examples of the diverse areas impacted by these materials are biocompatible coatings for implants, films for controlled drug release, self-healing soft materials and responsive hydrogels that react to varying pH conditions, temperature or light","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23dcad6f8a00b86ff6a9db0747c005c42d7dc764","amp;dn":"Hydrogel+Micro+and+Nanoparticles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23dcad6f8a00b86ff6a9db0747c005c42d7dc764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,220,173,111,138,0,184,111,246,169,219,7,71,192,5,196,45,125,199,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
