They are meant to be burned to DVD but can be just as easily mounted or extracted and played from your hard drive.\n\nAwesome course series...Deke McClelland is an excellent teacher. Easy to understand and an expert on all topics. I've seen a number of other course teachers that were either just plain boring or their voices were too damn irritating to listen to but Deke keeps you awake and interested in the topic at hand.\n\nBurn to DVD/Mount/or Extract to your hard drive and happy learning!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cda3519e79149b4a36e6ea59f5afe3b174f8faf","amp;dn":"Photoshop+CS4+One-on-One+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cda3519e79149b4a36e6ea59f5afe3b174f8faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,218,53,25,231,145,73,180,163,110,110,165,159,90,254,59,23,79,143,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
