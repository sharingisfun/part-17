Gog did not upload the hotfix update for the mac version. Once they do, I be sur to upload it for you guys.\n\n\n---------------\n\n\nWasteland 2 (Patch 2 Update Notes)\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Large amount of memory optimizations, particularly with audio, to improve performance and stability on lower-spec systems and 32-bit operating systems.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed enemy Ã¢â‚¬Å“unlimited APÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ movement bug that allowed them to sometimes move much farther than intended.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Extensive improvements and fixes to California questlines, particularly in Hollywood and Griffith Park. May require you to load an older save file before Hollywood to fully benefit.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added a travel speed toggle to the world map, allowing you to zip and zoom around if you so please (doesn't affect encounters, only travel speed).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added a new UI when CNPCs are recruited. This lets you more easily compare their stats and choose to dismiss one when a new one offers to join.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Custom portraits will now work correctly when Windows account username contains non-English characters.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added support for &quot;Very Large&quot; text.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added 50 messages to load screens containing gameplay hints and tips.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Loading now continues when the game is tabbed out, and pauses after finishing.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Further UI fixes and improvements, such as new and correctly used icons.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Many localization updates and bug fixes across all languages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2c378c567a9d36529f1dd24083efc8ce02df42","amp;dn":"Wasteland+2+%28Mac%29+%28Patch+2%29+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2c378c567a9d36529f1dd24083efc8ce02df42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,44,55,140,86,122,157,54,82,159,29,210,64,131,239,200,206,2,223,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
