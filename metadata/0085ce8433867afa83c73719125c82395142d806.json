In this case, torrent #10937301 (piratebay). I will repeat what I had there and add a bit at the end:\n\n[QUOTE]\nFrom torrent #10937301:\n----------------------\n    As I am typing this, and because I went to look up Jean Claude Lauzon's vitals, just below this window's frame is the following text: \n\n        Montreal, April 30, 2014Ã¢â‚¬â€Telefilm Canada proudly announces that\n        the late Jean-Claude Lauzon's acclaimed 1992 film LÃƒâ€°OLO will\n        screen as part of Cannes ...\n\n    I don't know why the return to Cannes this year, but I think it is quite telling that LÃƒÂ©olo is still very much in the public eye in 2014 even if, sadly, Jean Claude Lauzon is not. So far it's proven an impossibility for me to locate a decent rip of the film (but I'm still looking), so I've taken what's available which is a very low quality DVD rip @288p, resized slightly to (480p) hoping to improve the picture a little. I think it's a bit better than what I started with, but definitely nothing to write home about!\n\n    But that is not the reason for my wanting to add this new version to the plethora (1) of versions out there (there may be anotherÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ downloading now).\n\n    The main reason for this release and this torrent has to do with the fact that to this very day the film, to my knowledge, does not have proper English subtitles. I'm not talking about captions - it has captions - I'm talking about subtitles which is an entirely different thing altogether. In fact, I would venture to guess that almost anyone, yourself included, has never seen a movie with subtitles in your entire life. You see, subtitling is an art form; one, which I have to admit, I am no expert at in. In fact, this is my very first attempt!\n\n    Having no guide to turn to (did I mention that subtitling is also a &quot;lost&quot; art form?) besides my own vague memories of having seen it done once (that was, oh maybe 30 years ago?) when I actually saw the proper use of subtitles in a movie. It happened to be a very old foreign film (I think German, perhaps from about the mid 1950's). Nowadays, whether it's subtitles downloaded from &quot;open subtitles&quot; (which no longer exists anyway), or straight from a commercial DVD, I yet to see anything but straight forward word-for-word &quot;captions&quot; (short for &quot;closed captions&quot; [CC] - ie. for use by deaf people).\n\n    Captions are actually very easy to make. And in fact I'm actually quite accomplished when it comes to doing that (mindless) task. It's not something I'm particularly proud of. Anyone can do it.\n\n    So what I have done is I've taken existing CC's (captions) together a copy of the french CC's (included here) and tried my best (over a period of about a week now) with my limited knowledge of French, but taking advantage of the fact that I come from MontrÃƒÂ©al, to try to produce *real* subtitles for this movie. Most movies don't require much more than captions, but in this case subtitles are essential in order to draw your attention away from the text and towards the *FRENCH* narrative which is beautifully lyrical; almost like a poem.\n\n    I have taken great liberties in this effort and probably made a few blunders in altering the English text. But I am sure that I corrected far more mistakes than I added! But most importantly, whenever possible, I've striven to reformat the English phrasing to be more in line with the French so as to help bring out the various and beautiful rhyming patterns in the French narrative. So I have not always used proper English; opting instead for improper English but using similar words to the French. \n\n    I've also cut out as much &quot;irrelevant&quot; text as I could find; stuff like the uttering of people's names, which might be necessary for the deaf, but certainly not (generally) for subtitles; once or twice at the beginning should be enough. I know, from having see it, that proper subtitles should be as unobtrusive as possible; only guiding the viewer when necessary and nothing more. Also, it is not always necessary to understand each and every word spoken during a scene in order to understand its meaning. Overdoing the text can often spoil a scene by distracting your attention away from its *real* meaning, or just as often, its beauty.\n\n    I realize an incorrect interpretation, no matter how subtle, may completely change the meaning of what's actually being said. Especially in the case of this movie. And in several instances I have completely changed the meaning of the text, but I think that the original captions were in fact wrong in those cases.\n\n    I invite any suggestions for corrections and improvements.\n\n[/QUOTE]\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI will just add that I managed to acquire a copy of *one of* the DVD releases of this film (it happens to be a (Ã‚Â¾)Ã‚Â² or 9/16 version, instead of the other which is 20/37 or 1/1.85) which I converted it to an XviD avi.\n\nThe quality is quite good I think. Unfortunately I wasn't able to copy the DVD directly to AVI, instead having to rely on AutoGuardianKnot which is great in some ways, but not so great in others. There's a bit too much emphasis on the &quot;Auto&quot; so to speak, so you just have to hope it chooses the best settings. I think it came out quite good.\n\nI have also made some corrections and improvements to the subtitles. I deleted a few more &quot;unnecessaries&quot;, corrected some spelling errors and misinterpretations and also came up with several improved wordings (I think) over what I had last go at this.\n\nHere are the new video details\n------------------------------\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Jean-Claude Lauzon - LÃƒÂ©olo (1992).avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                           : OpenDML\nFile size                                : 5.25 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 47mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 7 014 Kbps\nWriting application                      : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                          : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 1\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Custom\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 47mn\nBit rate                                 : 6 816 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.308\nStream size                              : 5.10 GiB (97%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 64\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 1h 47mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 147 MiB (3%)\nAlignment                                : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 96 ms (2.30 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration             : 96 ms\nLanguage                                 : Francais\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n- user101966","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0085ce8433867afa83c73719125c82395142d806","amp;dn":"Leolo.1992.Jean.Claude.Lauzon.HDTV.XviD.AC3.720p.EngSrt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0085ce8433867afa83c73719125c82395142d806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,133,206,132,51,134,122,250,131,199,55,25,18,92,130,57,81,66,216,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
