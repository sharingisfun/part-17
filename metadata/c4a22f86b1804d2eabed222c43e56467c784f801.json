This recording is one I found on the internet. It is a broadcast from Sirius XM. This is not a Premier Radio Networks edit so there are no extras.\n\nOriginally broadcast on July 1st, 1978, this is American Top 40's Top 50 Acts of the Seventies. At one point Casey explains, &quot;We rank the acts by giving them points for each hit song based on its position in the survey for each week it is on.&quot; Supposedly the AT40 staff figured that this far into the decade, no late-comers could compete with this forty.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n40: Earth, Wind &amp; Fire - Sing A Song (1976)\n39: Electric Light Orchestra - Evil Woman (1976)\n38: Grand Funk - We're An American Band (1973)\n37: ABBA - Waterloo (1974)\n36: Steve Miller Band - Rockin' Me (1976)\n35: Ringo Starr - Photograph (1973)\n34: Captain and Tennille - Love Will Keep Us Together (1975)\n33: The Stylistics - Rock 'N' Roll Baby (1974)\n32: Carly Simon - That's The Way I Always Heard It Should Be (1970)\n31: Donny Osmond - Go Away Little Girl (1971)\n30: Linda Ronstadt - You're No Good (1975)\n29: Rod Stewart - Maggie May (1971)\n28: Killing Me Softly With His Song (1973)\n27: The Temptations - Papa Was A Rolling Stone (1972)\n26: James Taylor - You've Got A Friend (1971)\n25: Paul Simon - Loves Me Like A Rock (1973)\n24: War - Cisco Kid (1973)\n23: Bread - Make It With You (1970)\n22: Olivia Newton-John - I Honestly Love You (1974)\n21: Elvis Presley - The Wonder Of You (1970)\n20: Spinners - Rubberband Man (1976)\n19: Marvin Gaye - What's Goin' On (1971)\n18: Barry Manilow - Mandy (1975)\n17: Aretha Franklin - Until You Come Back To Me (1974)\n16: Neil Diamond - Cracklin' Rosie (1970)\n15: John Denver - Take Me Home Country Roads (1971)\n14: Eagles - New Kid In Town (1973)\n13: Al Green - Let's Stay Together (1977)\n12: Diana Ross - Ain't No Mountain High Enough (1970)\n11: Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn - Knock Three Times (1970)\n10: Helen Reddy - You And Me Against The World (1974)\n9: Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips - Midnight Train To Georgia (1973)\n8: Three Dog Night - Mama Told Me Not To Come (1970)\n7: Chicago - Saturday In The Park (1972)\n6: Jackson Five - I Want You Back (1970)\n5: Stevie Wonder - Superstition (1973)\n4: The Carpenters - Close To You (1970)\n3: Paul McCartney &amp; Wings - Band On The Run (1977)\n2: The Bee Gees - Jive Talkin' (1975)\n1: Elton John - Philadelphia Freedom (1975)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a22f86b1804d2eabed222c43e56467c784f801","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1978_July_1st_Top_40_Recording_Acts_Of_The_Seven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4a22f86b1804d2eabed222c43e56467c784f801","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,162,47,134,177,128,77,46,171,237,34,44,67,229,100,103,199,132,248,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
