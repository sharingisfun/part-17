Beginning as a Romantic, he incorporated aspects of Neo-Classicism in his musical personality, especially traits imbibed from Prokofiev. As time went on he mellowed, took on Hindemith in his late manner, and produced polytonal music of great character. The Meditations is one of his late works, and achieved some celebrity before the BBC asserted (for a number of years) a ruthless policy of favoring only new classical works written in a serial or post-serialist style. Perhaps he'll catch on again. If he doesn't, at least the music remains. \r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nYou can find all my classical uploads by searching on Philidor, or just looking in this regularly updated thread:\r\n  \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Philidor-s-uploads--63895","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77fc7c2f44030e4f31b2ae7860a61112f42b561f","amp;dn":"Arthur+Bliss+-+Meditations+on+a+Theme+by+John+Blow+%5BPhilidor%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77fc7c2f44030e4f31b2ae7860a61112f42b561f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,252,124,47,68,3,14,79,49,178,174,120,96,166,17,18,244,43,86,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
