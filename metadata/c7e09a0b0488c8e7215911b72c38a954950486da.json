But it quickly does as he finds himself jobless, his home and family gone. The few corporations that now rule Earth, treating him like an outcast, rejecting his pleas for employment without review. Having no other choice, he leaves traditional society behind, following the tracks that countless others have walked before. Except, TrentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new life doesn't last long as he finds himself trapped in a series of bizarre Ã¢â‚¬Å“trialsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ conducted by a secret organization that if failed, could cost him his very life. \n\nMeanwhile, far from Earth, living the noble life of luxury on the paradise planet, Tidelia, Sasha, the beautiful third Princess of NHA galaxy 189, spends her idle days with her best friend and lady-in-waiting, Tiana. But these days come to an end when an unexpected gift from her father, King Johan, sends her on a journey to the far reaches of the galaxy to be crowned ruler of the newly created, sovereign duchy, Alutia, which just so happens to include governorship of the special protectorate of Earth. \n\nJoin Trent and Sasha as they learn the realities of their new worlds, experience the political trials and tribulations of a universe unknown to one, and unexpected to the other. Travel on a journey of sorrow and loss, of redemption and love, of hope within darkness; an adventure that leads to a discovery that will change not only their lives, but the future of the Earth, possibly the future of the very universe, forever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7e09a0b0488c8e7215911b72c38a954950486da","amp;dn":"Alutia+Rising%2C+Anniversary+Edition+%28Alutia+Rising+Series%2C+Book+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7e09a0b0488c8e7215911b72c38a954950486da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,224,154,11,4,136,200,231,33,89,17,183,44,56,169,84,149,4,134,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
