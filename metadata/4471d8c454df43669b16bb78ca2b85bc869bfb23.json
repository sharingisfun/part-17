IT WAS CREATED BY A MEMBER OF THE WIISO.COM FORUMS.\n\nSimply download and burn to a disc or transfer to a USB storage device or SD card of your choice (I recommend using Wii Backup Manager for this) and run via your favourite loader (I recommend USB Loader CFG and Wiiflow). It should work on default loader settings for ALL NTSC Wiis. PAL and NTSC-J users will have to change their video mode option to Force NTSC for the game to display properly.\n\nNOTE: This mod was done to only the ENGLISH version of Mario Kart Wii. If your Wii is set to another language, you will NOT see many of the edits.\n\n- Custom Strap/ESRB Warning &amp; recoloured user interface\n- 32 Texture hacked courses with multiplayer support\n- 32 Custom track songs &amp; SFX music edits\n- 1 customized battle course\n- Many customized characters/vehicles\n- Other various text substitutions (course names, race countdown, credits etc.)\n\n\nQ: Can I play this online? Will I get banned?\nA: Yes, you can play it online. This is because the texture hacked courses are structurally the exact same as the original ones, so it makes no difference when playing online. You can't get banned using this mod, because it does not affect gameplay.\n\nQ: What will other people see when they play me online?\nA: Other people won't notice any difference. Their game is not modified, so theirs will look the same as the original.\n\nQ: What about my other copy of Mario Kart Wii?\nA: I've changed the titleID for this game from RCME01 to CKBE88 so you can hold both your original and your modded copy of Mario Kart on the same drive and they won't interfere with one another.\n\n                             88             88                     \n  ,d                         &quot;&quot;             88                     \n  88                                        88                     \nMM88MMM  8b      db      d8  88  ,adPPYba,  88   ,d8  8b       d8  \n  88     `8b    d88b    d8'  88  I8[    &quot;&quot;  88 ,a8&quot;   `8b     d8'  \n  88      `8b  d8'`8b  d8'   88   `&quot;Y8ba,   8888[      `8b   d8'   \n  88,      `8bd8'  `8bd8'    88  aa    ]8I  88`&quot;Yba,    `8b,d8'    \n  &quot;Y888      YP      YP      88  `&quot;YbbdP&quot;'  88   `Y8a     Y88'     \n                                                          d8'      \n                                                         d8'\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4471d8c454df43669b16bb78ca2b85bc869bfb23","amp;dn":"%28Wii%29+Mario+Kart+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4471d8c454df43669b16bb78ca2b85bc869bfb23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,113,216,196,84,223,67,102,155,22,187,120,202,43,133,188,134,155,251,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
