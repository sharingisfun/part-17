Everyone knows the name of\nCommissioner Gordon. But what of his rise from rookie detective to Police\nCommissioner? What did it take to navigate the layers of corruption in\nGotham City, the spawning ground of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconic villains?\nGOTHAM is the origin story of the great DC Comics Super-Villains and\nvigilantes, revealing an entirely new chapter that has never been told.\nFrom executive producer Bruno Heller, this crime drama follows one cop's\nrise through a dangerously corrupt city and chronicles the genesis of one\nof the most popular super heroes of our time. Although the crime drama\nfollows Gordon's turbulent and singular career, it also focuses on his\nunlikely friendship with the young heir to the Wayne fortune - a friendship\nthat will play a crucial role in helping the young boy eventually become\nthe crusader he's destined to be.\n\nProduced by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television.\n\n\nDetectives Gordon and Bullock investigate a child trafficking ring preying on\nGotham's street kids, including Selina Kyle. Meanwhile, Penguin resurfaces in the\ncountryside and begins to make his way back to GOTHAM, leaving victims in his wake.\n\nGotham.S01E02.Selina.Kyle.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.AAC2.0.H.264-YFN\n\nFormat: Matroska Video File (MKV)\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 1916x1076 23.976fps\nAudio 1: Dolby AC3 48000Hz 6 channels 384Kbps\nAudio 2: MPEG4 Audio (AAC) 48000Hz stereo\nSubs: English Closed Captions (SubRip Text)\nDuration: 00:43:56\nFile size: 1.69 GB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9d848a8baf2a4e276c64067f0ddbcd9bc32040d","amp;dn":"Gotham.S01E02.Selina.Kyle.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-YFN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9d848a8baf2a4e276c64067f0ddbcd9bc32040d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,216,72,168,186,242,164,226,118,198,64,103,240,221,188,217,188,50,4,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
