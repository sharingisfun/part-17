With the 1973 addition of guitarist Billy Jones, the lineup was complete, and after a year of intense touring the band became the first act signed to Arista under Clive Davis; the Outlaws' self-titled 1975 album spotlighted their Eagles-influenced harmonies and Allman Brothers-like guitar attack, yielding the Top 40 hit &quot;There Goes Another Love Song.&quot;\n\n\nArtist...............: Outlaws\nAlbum................: Best Of Outlaws Green Grass &amp; High Tides\nGenre................: Southern Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: (1999)\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/13/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front, Back, CD\n\n\n\n\nTracks - \n\n\n01.There Goes Another Love Song\n02.Knoxville Girl\n03.Song For You\n04.Waterhole\n05.Green Grass &amp; High Tides\n06.Breaker Breaker\n07.South Carolina\n08.Freeborn Man\n09.Prisoner\n10.Girl From Ohio\n11.Stick Around For Rock &amp; Roll\n12.Hurry Sundown\n13.Gunsmoke\n14.You Are The Show\n15.Take It Any Way You Want It\n16.(Ghost) Riders In The Sky\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n  Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081bb0fe1d070cb11b58aaada411f324e9ce45d4","amp;dn":"Outlaws+-+Green+Grass+%26amp%3B+High+Tides+Best+1999+FLAC+vtwin88cub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081bb0fe1d070cb11b58aaada411f324e9ce45d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,27,176,254,29,7,12,177,27,88,170,173,164,17,243,36,233,206,69,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
