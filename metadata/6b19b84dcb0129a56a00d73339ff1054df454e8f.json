The planet most like ours, it has still been thought impossible to reach, let alone explore and inhabit.\n\nNow with the advent of a revolutionary new plan, all this has changed. Leading space exploration authority Robert Zubrin has crafted a daring new blueprint, Mars Direct, presented here with illustrations, photographs, and engaging anecdotes.\n\n&quot;The Case for Mars&quot; is not a vision for the far future or one that will cost us impossible billions. It explains step-by-step how we can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars within ten years; actually produce fuel and oxygen on the planet's surface with Martian natural resources; how we can build bases and settlements; and how we can one day &quot;terraform&quot; Mars-- a process that can alter the atmosphere of planets and pave the way for sustainable life.\n\n368 pages\nPublisher: Free Press\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0684835509\nISBN-13: 978-0684835501","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b19b84dcb0129a56a00d73339ff1054df454e8f","amp;dn":"The+Case+for+Mars+%281996%29+by+Robert+Zubrin+%26amp%3B+Richard+Wagner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b19b84dcb0129a56a00d73339ff1054df454e8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,25,184,77,203,1,41,165,106,0,215,51,57,255,16,84,223,69,78,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
