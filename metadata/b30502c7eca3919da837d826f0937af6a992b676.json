Although Rick has always known he was of German descent, he knows very little of his German family - but the one thing he is sure of is that he wouldn't have the business he has today without them. In the early 70s, he inherited Ã‚Â£10,000 from a great uncle that he never knew, money which provided him with a great investment in his restaurant.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0b43626c634b473f253a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3407Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~122Kbps)\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.48 GB\nSource: HDTV\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b30502c7eca3919da837d826f0937af6a992b676","amp;dn":"Rick.Steins.German.Bite.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b30502c7eca3919da837d826f0937af6a992b676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,5,2,199,236,163,145,157,168,55,216,38,240,147,122,246,169,146,182,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
