The information takes the form of peer-reviewed articles, R&amp;D notes, topical review papers, tutorial papers, book reviews, meeting announcements, and news.\r\nCoverage includes fundamental and practical aspects of adsorption: mathematics, thermodynamics, chemistry, and physics, as well as processes, applications, models engineering, and equipment design.\r\nAmong the topics are Adsorbents: new materials, new synthesis techniques, characterization of structure and properties, and applications; Equilibria: novel theories or semi-empirical models, experimental data, and new measurement methods; Kinetics: new models, experimental data, and measurement methods. Processes: chemical, biochemical, environmental, and other applications, purification or bulk separation, fixed bed or moving bed systems, simulations, experiments, and design procedures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d169f0a60c553d601c4eed00dfb6bbd00951ae","amp;dn":"Adsorption+%281995-2015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d169f0a60c553d601c4eed00dfb6bbd00951ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,209,105,240,166,12,85,61,96,28,78,237,0,223,182,187,208,9,81,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
