We had to stop playing due to physical and medical reasons involving 2 of the members.\n\nUnfortunately we were unable to record our full length album due to the same reasons.\n\nThe demo, for all intents and purposes, was complete except for guitar solos.\nI have included material, from the Jam session recordings, that would havwe been on the album. Sadly, there were also 3 other songs that I have no recording of at all.\n\n*this is not the same Pallbearer that formed in the United States in 2010, and is a different sub-gerne of Metal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328504ba44831143e3b96ca6580393a71f1a29e8","amp;dn":"Pallbearer+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328504ba44831143e3b96ca6580393a71f1a29e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,133,4,186,68,131,17,67,227,185,108,166,88,3,147,167,31,26,41,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
