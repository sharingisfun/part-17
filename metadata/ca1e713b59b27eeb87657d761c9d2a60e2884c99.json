It is 3 Doors Down's first album in the three years since 2002's Away from the Sun. It topped the chart on the Billboard 200 soon after it was released. Bob Seger sings a duet with lead singer, Brad Arnold, on the song &quot;Landing in London&quot;. It is 3 Doors Down's heaviest album to date due to richer guitar riffs and beefier drums, along with gloomier lyrics than the band's previous efforts.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img386.imageshack.us/img386/8788/3doorsdownseventeendayswn5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img386.imageshack.us/img386/8788/3doorsdownseventeendayswn5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
