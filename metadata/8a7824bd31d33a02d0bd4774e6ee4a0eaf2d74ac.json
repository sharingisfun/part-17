What started as a joke in the A State of Trance radio show, has now turned into a worldwide happening: 'Who's Afraid of 138?!'. And so, Armin van Buuren decided to dedicate an entire record label to the booming bass of uplifting. And it kicks off with his very own 'Who's Afraid of 138?!', in the smashing Photographer remix. A realm for the 138 BPM junkies, a welcome home to those who create or support it. The label of 'Who's Afraid of 138?!' kicks off with the much-wanted Photographer remix of Armin's 'Who's Afraid of 138?!' track, taken from his 'Intense' album. Often played in his ASOT shows and loved by many, it has become the soundtrack to a new sensation, hitting dance land at a swift pace.\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.beatport.com/release/whos-afraid-of-138-!-photographer-remix/1130561&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.beatport.com/release/whos-afraid-of-138-!-photographer-remix/1130561&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n01.
