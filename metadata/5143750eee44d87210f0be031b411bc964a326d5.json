Gangsters is the strategy game where crime pays, and with dividends! You can don the knuckle dusters and persuade the local business owners to pay you for protection services. You can get your hands even more dirty and navigate in the cutthroat world of politics. Or simply go for the throat as you order your wiseguys to execute your enemies in the streets and show the city whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the boss. Gangsters gives you all the power you need to get things done.\n\nBonus content: manual, soundtrack.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run setup_gangsters_1.0.0.13.exe and install the game;\n2) Start the game using main executable or shortcuts.\n\n! Warning\nSome users on the GOG forum have reported having problems when running the game on Windows 7. For me the game itself worked well on Windows 7 x64, but the cutscenes were glitchy.\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5143750eee44d87210f0be031b411bc964a326d5","amp;dn":"Gangsters+Organized+Crime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5143750eee44d87210f0be031b411bc964a326d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,67,117,14,238,68,216,114,16,240,190,3,27,65,27,201,100,163,38,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
