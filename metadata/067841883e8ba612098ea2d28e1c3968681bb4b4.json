This a scanned copy of every page of the book. I always thought it was hard to find sheet music so I am releasing some of my collection maybe. I have other intro's to major composers so leave a comment if you think I should post a specific one. I might have ones for Beethovan, Bach, and Liszt. I have a lot more music so feel free to suggest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:067841883e8ba612098ea2d28e1c3968681bb4b4","amp;dn":"Young+Pianist%5C%27s+Guide+to+HAYDN+edited+and+performed+by+YELDA+NO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"067841883e8ba612098ea2d28e1c3968681bb4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,120,65,136,62,139,166,18,9,142,162,210,142,28,57,104,104,27,180,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
