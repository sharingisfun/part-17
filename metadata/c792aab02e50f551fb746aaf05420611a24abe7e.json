Irene Pappas - Sings Mikis Theodorakis \n\nThe Clive Barnes, the most reputable art critic of the New York Times, wrote about the interpretation of the Irene Pappas: &quot;... Irene Pappas is a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“KlytaemnestraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢of the more noble passion, with a voice like a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“red wine that rolls like a thunderboltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.Irene Pappas is known to the public as an actor, but precisely for this reason, singing with intensity, the same format with black hair korakisia is an equally dynamic way of expression ... &quot; \nIn her voice you can hear the lament of the Greek choral, the torture of a tragic. \nIn the American public Irene Pappas is better known by their roles in the film in which she collaborated with renowned producer, director and fellow of Michael Cacoyannis, the Electra and Zorba.

Mikis Theodorakis - Electra (OST) (1962) \n\nFilmed in 1961 by Michael Cacoyannis and starring Irene Pappas, Yannis Ferti and Aleka Katseli, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ElektraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is one of the best productions of Greek cinema-was indeed one of the few candidates for Foreign Film Oscar. \nThe music was written in 1962 in Paris. \nHaving seen the film repeatedly in mouviola (the machine which is for the editing), the Mikis Theodorakis wrote fourteen musical themes, using a variety of instruments (santouri and gupsy clarinet, to contrabass and trombones) and percussion-drums mainly, but also stones and iron. \nThe result, especially in coexistence with the image, is impressive. \nAs the composer himself, &quot;the music served as an internal audio extension of all elements of the Kakogianni: The landscape of people, but also considerations, of intuition, fears, the anguish, pain and despair of them. \nAfter the new treatment (remaster), the audio sounds significantly improved, while the song by Lydia Yota that added comes from the old and visibly worn visual tone of the film.
