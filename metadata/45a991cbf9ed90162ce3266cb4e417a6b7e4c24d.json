This volume explains the technical details of the main Ethernet family members, starting with the familiar 10Base-T, through Fast Ethernet, to the latest Gigabit Ethernet and wireless variants. The applications that can now be supported on a uniform network technology are explained: the way in which Ethernet promises to capture the wide area, mobile data and storage markets is discussed in some detail, with business issues as well as technical issues being highlighted. In summary, this text shows how the Ethernet can be used as a network technology for all purposes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45a991cbf9ed90162ce3266cb4e417a6b7e4c24d","amp;dn":"%5BCHM%5D+%5B2002%5D+Gigabit+Ethernet+Technology+and+Applications+%28Artec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45a991cbf9ed90162ce3266cb4e417a6b7e4c24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,169,145,203,249,237,144,22,44,227,38,108,180,228,23,166,183,228,194,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
