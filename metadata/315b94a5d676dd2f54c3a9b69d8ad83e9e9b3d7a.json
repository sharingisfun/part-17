MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e had only been founded by the rhythm section - bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee - in the year prior to this concert in Los Angeles. To front the band the duo eventually recruited Bob Deal aka Mick Mars (lead guitar) and Vince Neil (vocals). Legend has it that the double umlaut distinguishing the band s name were inspired by the German lager LÃƒÂ¶wenbrÃƒÂ¤u.\n\nMÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e's first album Too Fast For Love was originally issued on their own record label, LeathÃƒÂ¼r Records, in November 1981 and sold an impressive 20,000 copies - no mean achievement for an independently released debut. Bassist Nikki Sixx was clearly a very dominant force in the band - writing seven of the album s ten tracks alone and co-writing the remainder with Vince Neil and Lizzie Grey. The album was remixed and partially re-recorded for reissue some nine months later, after the band had signed with Elektra Records. One song, Stick To Your Guns, failed to make the transition and was dropped entirely. In the new format the record reached a very impressive number 77 on the Billboard 200 chart - although in subsequent years, as the band s popularity soared, accumulated sales have boosted it to platinum status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe album is heavily featured in this broadcast recording and there are great versions of Take Me To The Top, Public Enemy #1, Starry Eyes, Piece Of The Action, Merry-Go-Round and set closer Live Wire. The studio version of the latter had also been issued as a single by LeathÃƒÂ¼r Records just three months prior to this show. The song has since been used on the soundtrack to several video games and the classic TV 1980 s series Charlie s Angels . Although the band s sophomore album, Shout At The Devil , would not be released for almost another year, MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e were already honing several of its songs live. Featured in this set are the title track, Looks That Kill and Red Hot. A fourth track, Hotter Than Hell, was also demoed during this period but was not eventually included on the finished album and thus makes a welcome and rare appearance here.\n\nThe remaining song in the set list, Runnin' Wild In The Night, is another rarity and has never been released in a studio-recorded version. Listening to the riffs and lyrics it is clear that elements from it have been re-used in creating other numbers, notably from the first verse which is lyrically identical to Save Our Souls, a track later included on the Theater Of Pain album (1985)\n\n\n\n\nMotley Crue Studio Discography:\nToo Fast for Love     1981\nShout at the Devil     1983\nTheatre of Pain     1985\nGirls, Girls, Girls     1987\nDr. Feelgood     1989\nMÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e     1994\nGeneration Swine     1997\nNew Tattoo     2000\nSaints of Los Angeles     2008\n\n\n\nLine-Up:\nNikki Sixx\nTommy Lee\nMick Mars\nVince Neil\n\n\n\nInfo:\nArtist:  Motley Crue\nAlbum: Wild In The Night [Live Broadcast 1982]\nLabel: Parallel Lines\nGenre: Hard Rock, Glam, Heavy Metal\nYear: 2014\nCountry Of Origin: U.S.A\nAudio codec: MP3\nRiptype: Tracks\nBitrate: 320 kbps\nPlaying Time: 00:48:09\nSize: 111 MB\nIncluded - Front Cover\n\n\nTracklist:\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Take Me to the Top\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Looks That Kill\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Public Enemy\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Red Hot\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Starry Eyes\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Piece of Your Action\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shout at the Devil\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Merry-Go-Round\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ RunninÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wild in the Night\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hotter Than Hell\n11 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Live Wire\n\n\nGenre:\tRock\nSubgenre:\tHard Rock, Glam, Heavy Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t111.16 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n12 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:315b94a5d676dd2f54c3a9b69d8ad83e9e9b3d7a","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-++Wild+in+the+Night+-+Live+Broadcast+1982+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"315b94a5d676dd2f54c3a9b69d8ad83e9e9b3d7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,91,148,165,214,118,221,47,84,195,169,182,157,138,216,62,158,155,61,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
