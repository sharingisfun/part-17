Rota, who had built his reputation alongside Fellini (though he&amp;#039;d already scored some three dozen films in the previous 20 years), brought Neopolitan jazz stylings and a Sicilian melodic sensibilty (characterized perfectly by the main title&amp;#039;s mournful solo trumpet, which has since become a cinematic icon) to a story of corruption and betrayal as American as, well, gnocchi. Listening to this masterful score one can&amp;#039;t help but wonder what Rota, who died in 1979) might have accomplished had he begun working with Hollywood&amp;#039;s resources a decade earlier.\n\n\t\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe823e6fc0441833416e5bc76d11ffb992f07e15","amp;dn":"Nino+Rota+-+The+Godfather+%5Bsoundtrack%5D%5B1972%2C1991%5D%5BOgg+Vorbis+Q8%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe823e6fc0441833416e5bc76d11ffb992f07e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,130,62,111,192,68,24,51,65,110,91,199,109,17,255,185,146,240,126,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
