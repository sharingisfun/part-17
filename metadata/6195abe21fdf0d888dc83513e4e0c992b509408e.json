The album's sound differs from Regan's previous album, The End of History, featuring more electric guitar-based rock songs. Regarding this change in musical direction, Regan states that &quot;this album's lyrically quite fast, with lots of word changes and phrase changes, and it asked for a different kind of coat.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n============\n\n\n1. &quot;Protection Racket&quot; - 2:39\n2. &quot;Catacombs&quot; - 3:25\n3. &quot;Coathook&quot; - 2:20\n4. &quot;Genocide Matinee&quot; - 3:52\n5. &quot;Violent Demeanour&quot; - 3:32\n6. &quot;Lines Written In Winter&quot; - 3:58\n7. &quot;House Detective&quot; - 3:06\n8. &quot;Little Nancy&quot; - 3:17\n9. &quot;Lord Help My Poor Soul&quot; - 4:45\n10. &quot;The Shadow of an Empire&quot; - 4:04\n\n*All songs written and arranged by Fionn Regan\n\n\n===========================================================\n\nAs always: Enjoy &amp; keep seeding for others!!!\nThanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6195abe21fdf0d888dc83513e4e0c992b509408e","amp;dn":"Fionn+Regan+-+The+Shadow+Of+An+Empire+%282010%29%28Indie+Alt+Folk+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6195abe21fdf0d888dc83513e4e0c992b509408e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,149,171,226,31,223,13,136,141,200,53,19,228,224,201,146,181,9,64,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
