That identity comes across full force in Little Honey, the follow-up to 2007â€™s heavily brooding West, where her melancholy voice seemed to creak with sadness. Here, a full-throated Williams revels in the rejuvenation of her engagement to her manager/co-producer Tom Overby, over whom sheâ€™s positively giddy on &quot;Real Love.&quot; \r\n\r\nHer newfound bliss opens the floodgates to a musical revival, as well, since Little Honey, her ninth studio album, ranks as one of her most diverse, ranging from pounding rock â€˜nâ€™ roll (the raw sex of the title track) to the Hank Williams-ish country blues of &quot;Well, Well, Well,&quot; to &quot;Knowing&quot;'s â€˜60s soul. But some of the finest writing appears on &quot;Plan to Marry,&quot; as thoughtful a meditation on love as any time-honored sonnet. Just when Williams seems to have run the gamut, she pulls out a Stones-y (via Louisiana) cover of AC/DCâ€™s &quot;Itâ€™s a Long Way to the Top&quot; as the punctuation mark. It all makes for a rollicking ride with one of roots-rock's most unpredictable and passionate artists.\r\n\r\nLittle Honey is a much happier album the Lucinda's last album, West, although I'm not sure it's better, it's just as good just the same.\r\nThe album kicks off with &quot;Real Love&quot; a rocking, happy tune. It's something we've never heard from Lucinda, then it goes into the country-tinged ballad &quot;Circles and X's&quot; which was actually written over twenty years ago and I'm not sure why she hadn't used it before, and she slips into a very bluesy &quot;Tears Of Joy&quot; talking about playing games but now she has met a man to whom she loves, then comes the loud, beautiful &quot;Little Rock Star&quot;, now this is one of the highlights, most definitley, it may even be the best song on the album. &quot;Honey Bee&quot; is a fast raunchy rocker, it is fun although a bit silly.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Real Love\r\n02 - Circles ands X's\r\n03 - Tears of Joy\r\n04 - Little Rock Star\r\n05 - Honey Bee\r\n06 - Well Well Well\r\n07 - If Wishes Were Horses\r\n08 - Jailhouse Tears\r\n09 - Knowing\r\n10 - Heaven Blues\r\n11 - Rarity\r\n12 - Plan to Marry\r\n13 - It's a Long Way to the Top\r\n\r\n*2008 Lost Highway Records / Universal | B001143402\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nLucinda Williams â€“ vocals, acoustic guitar\r\nButch Norton â€“ drums, percussion\r\nDavid Sutton â€“ electric bass, double bass, cello\r\nChet Lyster â€“ electric and acoustic guitars, saw and table steel\r\nDoug Pettibone â€“ electric and acoustic guitars, pedal steel\r\n\r\nAdditional musicians\r\nRob Burger â€“ wurlitzer, vibraphone, piano, Hammond organ\r\nMatthew Sweet, Susanna Hoffs â€“ backing vocals (&quot;Real Love&quot;, &quot;Little Rock Star&quot;, &quot;Rarity&quot;)\r\nCharlie Louvin, Jim Lauderdale â€“ backing vocals (&quot;Well Well Well&quot;)\r\nElvis Costello â€“ vocals (&quot;Jailhouse Tears&quot;)\r\nSusan Marshall, Gia Ciambotti, Kristenin Mooney â€“ backing vocals (&quot;Tears of Joy&quot;)\r\nKristen Mooney, Tim Easton, Susan Marshall â€“ backing vocals (&quot;It's a Long Way to the Top&quot;)\r\nJim Lauderdale, Susan Marshall, Gia Ciambotti, Kristen Mooney â€“ backing vocals (&quot;Jailhouse Tears&quot;)\r\nBruce Fowler â€“ trombone\r\nWalt Fowler â€“ flugelhorn\r\nAlbert Wing â€“ tenor sax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Lucinda Williams Album's....\r\n\r\n \r\nLucinda Williams - Live @ The Fillmore (2005) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/13209590/Lucinda_Williams_-_Live___The_Fillmore_(2005)_[2CD]_[EAC-FLAC]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucinda Williams - Down Where The Spirit Meets The Bone (2014):\r\n  \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13183249/Lucinda_Williams_-_Down_Where_The_Spirit_Meets_The_Bone_%282014%29\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLucinda Williams - Blessed (2011) [2CD] [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n   \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13163588/Lucinda_Williams_-_Blessed_%282011%29_%5B2CD%5D_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043edefedac25153d8266f13f7c7feaa8c0b4f7b","amp;dn":"Lucinda+Williams+-+Little+Honey+%282008%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043edefedac25153d8266f13f7c7feaa8c0b4f7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,62,222,254,218,194,81,83,216,38,111,19,247,199,254,170,140,11,79,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
