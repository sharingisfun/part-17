But as Garret Keizer illustrates in this probing examination, noise is as much about what we want as about what we seek to avoid. In a journey that leads us from the primeval Tanzanian veldt to wind farms in Maine, Keizer invites us to listen to noise in history, in popular culture, and not least of all in our own backyards. He follows noise throughout history and across the globe. He considers what it has to tell us about todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most pressing issues, from social inequality to climate change. The result is guaranteed to change how we hear the world, and how we measure our own personal volume within it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c2f3bf74e67496b62449f608c89a2acb223ba2d","amp;dn":"The+Unwanted+Sound+of+Everything+We+Want%3A+A+Book+About+Noise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c2f3bf74e67496b62449f608c89a2acb223ba2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,47,59,247,78,103,73,107,98,68,159,96,140,137,162,172,178,35,186,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
