This is NOT the Brood War expansion, but rather a very rare expansion that was authorized by Blizzard and released by WizardWorks (ironically the creators of the Deer Hunter series).\n\nFor more info, seek Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft:_Retribution\n\nIf you have any problems with this torrent, post a comment.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInstallation Note: For some reason the expansion will not install to my non default StarCraft directory, but maybe it is because the installer cannot &amp;#039;see&amp;#039; StarCraft anymore due to its extensive patching since the expansion&amp;#039;s release.  However, when I tried to install the expansion with a default directory installation of StarCraft with no patches outside of those accompanying the Brood War expansion, I had no troubles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4050a371f365c96b30a7a47e75985aa6aae8ee9","amp;dn":"Starcraft+Retribution+%28CD+ISO%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4050a371f365c96b30a7a47e75985aa6aae8ee9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,5,10,55,31,54,92,150,179,10,122,71,231,89,133,170,106,174,142,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
