No, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a dopey social media app youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never heard of until it was purchased by Google for billions of dollars. Nor is it a miracle cleaning solution sold in 90s infomercials for only $19.99, including a bonus travel-sized tube of YambaÃƒÂ³. YambaÃƒÂ³, quite simply, is YambaÃƒÂ³, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing else quite like YambaÃƒÂ³. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also entirely possible we just enjoy saying YambaÃƒÂ³.\n\nYambaÃƒÂ³ (AKA Cry of the Bewitched, but why would you call it that when you can call it YambaÃƒÂ³) takes place on a sugarcane plantation in Cuba in the 1850s, and centers on the love triangle between a master, one of his slaves, and YambaÃƒÂ³, the mysterious dancing granddaughter of a sorceress who lives in the wilderness - yeah, we know, another one of those dang Cuban plantation witch love triangle movies weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re always doing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weird, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flirty, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a cave granny with evil magic powers, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s YambaÃƒÂ³!\n\nJoin Mike, Kevin, Bill, and YambaÃƒÂ³ for YambaÃƒÂ³ YambaÃƒÂ³ and YambaÃƒÂ³ with YambaÃƒÂ³!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRiffTrax are comedy audio commentaries of Hollywood movies, television programs and films featuring Mystery Science \n\nTheater 3000 comedians Michael J.
