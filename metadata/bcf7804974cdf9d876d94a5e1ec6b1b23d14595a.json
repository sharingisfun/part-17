Flamboyant frontman Perry Farrell, formerly of the band Psi Com, had an undeniable charisma and an interest in provocative art (he designed the band's album covers), and Jane's Addiction played a hybrid of rock music: metal with strains of punk, folk, and jazz. The quartet, comprised of Farrell, bassist Eric Avery, drummer Stephen Perkins, and guitarist Dave Navarro, had already released its debut album as well, in the form of a live recording from the Roxy in Hollywood. Finally, Warner Bros. won the bidding war and released Nothing's Shocking in 1988. The band's abrasive sound and aggressive attitude (typified by the nude sculpture on the cover) led to some resistance, but Jane's Addiction began to break through to an audience -- the album spent 35 weeks on the charts. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Stop!\n02.Ocean Size\n03.Whores (Live)\n04.Ted, Just Admit It\n05.Ain't No Right\n06.Had A Dad\n07.Superhero\n08.Been Caught Stealing\n09.Just Because\n10.Three Days\n11.I Would For You\n12.Classic Girl\n13.Summertime Rolls\n14.Mountain Song\n15.Pigs In Zen\n16.Jane Says (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf7804974cdf9d876d94a5e1ec6b1b23d14595a","amp;dn":"Jane%5C%27s+Addiction+-+Up+From+The+Catacombs+Best+Of+%282006%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf7804974cdf9d876d94a5e1ec6b1b23d14595a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,247,128,73,116,205,249,216,118,217,74,94,30,198,177,178,61,20,89,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
