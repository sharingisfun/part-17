Less predictably perhaps, they\nsubject the revolution's failures and mistakes to\npainstaking scrutiny, especially the early stress on\nindustrialization. In their discussion of economic\nquestions, the reader will especially appreciate the\nremarkable lucidity and -graceful exposition. Particularly\ninteresting is the final chapter in which the authors softly,\nbut Insistently, suggest that the regime's paternalistic\npolitical style and its tendency to shut off political debate\nmay prove injurious to the very goals it hopes to achieve.\nUnfortunately this book cannot be summarized in a few\nwords; it is an important study and deserves reading by\nanyone concerned with the problems of Latin Am.erica or\nof underdevelopment or with the future of man. It is\nhighly recommended for all university Libraries and large\nhigh school and public libraries.&quot;\n\n                                                      Ã¢â‚¬â€Publishers' Weekly\n\n\nNote(s):\n\n1. Number of pages: 288\n\n\nOpinion:\n\nThis is why the U.S. empire has been waging war (i.e., economic, political, and military) against the Cuban people and the revolution for over 100 years (starting in 1895). Free healthcare, free education (from head start to PhD), free housing and utilities (or subsidize), economic, political, and social independence, agrarian reform (all have access to land), equality is something intolerable to the U.S. empire (i.e., capitalist/imperialist system whether Western or Eastern -- China, etc.).\n\nOf course, the U.S. empire's perpetual war (counter revolutionary, conquest, and plunder) against real democracy (socialism or whatever you want to call the real rule of the people) is not isolated to Cuba: El Salvador, Mexico, Brazil,Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Chile etc., Congo, Mali, Libya, Somalia, Egypt etc., Afghanistan (and the other Central Asian countries), Pakistan, India, Bangladesh etc., China, Korea, Indonesia, East Timor, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Philippines etc., Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Syria etc., Russia, Ukraine, Greece etc. Let's not forget the &quot;Native American&quot; genocide to first conquer the mainland continent courtesy of the U.S. military (you know the muscle men for capital and big business) and the African enslavement and continued oppression.\n\nFor reference on the above -- READ info outside of U.S. (or any other capitalist/anti human) propaganda.\n\nAnd Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas and Isis are bent on world domination (speech on 29 Sep 2014 at the U.N.)! Of course, that speech was for the many mindless, apathetic, and the ahistorical U.S. citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b7a31b9e34b94319e67556173894e9d156762d3","amp;dn":"Socialism+in+Cuba+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b7a31b9e34b94319e67556173894e9d156762d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,122,49,185,227,75,148,49,158,103,85,97,115,137,78,157,21,103,98,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
