The purpose of this manual is to provide information to enhance security, tactics and survival skills of law-abiding citizens who are faced with civil disorder, lawlessness, violence and physical threat in a post-collapse environment. The information in this manual is derived from years of experience gained from service with special operations forces (SOF) followed by extensive employment as a security contractor in hostile environments including Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a distillation of military and security training, principles, and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) adapted to the threat and environment anticipated in this type of scenario in order to provide knowledge needed to train to survive in a world turned upside down. It is no longer just survival of the fittest but survival of those prepared. The manual will take you from self-defense as an individual, team and family, both pre and post collapse, and move on to tactics, techniques, procedures and training that can be used by tactical teams that you may need to form in order to survive. In a serious post-event scenario, one of total collapse with several months or years before recovery, families, groups and communities may be forced to create such tactical defense forces to protect personnel, loved ones and resources against marauders. There is something in this manual for both the tactical newbie and the military veteran.\n\nFormat: Mobi (kindle)\n\nseed and enjoy\n\nif you like this book then please buy a copy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7bc645e8c9bba33f962abd61afcea602ddbc51","amp;dn":"Contact+A+tactical+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a7bc645e8c9bba33f962abd61afcea602ddbc51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,123,198,69,232,201,187,163,63,150,42,189,97,175,206,166,2,221,188,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
