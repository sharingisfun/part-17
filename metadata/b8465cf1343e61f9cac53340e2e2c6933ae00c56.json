Featured are all of the A and B sides of UFO singles spanning the years 1969 through 1986, which show the band developing from a no-frills, blues-based hard rock band to anthemic arena rockers.\n\nThe best selections are those taken from the band's 1974-1979 peak, when Michael Schenker was their lead guitarist, such as both studio and live versions of &quot;Doctor Doctor,&quot; &quot;Cherry,&quot; &quot;Only You Can Rock Me,&quot; and &quot;Lipstick Traces.&quot; If BEST OF SINGLES A's AND B's whets your UFO appetite, you may be ready for such '70s classics as LIGHTS OUT, OBSESSION, and the near-perfect live set, STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.\n\nFull title - Time To Rock - Best Of Singles A's &amp; B's.\n\nRecorded between 1969 and 1986.\n\nDISC 1\n\n1.
