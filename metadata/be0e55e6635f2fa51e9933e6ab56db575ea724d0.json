More than a work of academic commentary that would leave many of Levinas s pious commentators aghast, Sparrow exhibits an aspect of Levinas which is darker, yet no less fundamental, than his ethical and theological guises. This darkened Levinas provides answers to problems in aesthetics, speculative philosophy, ecology, ethics, and philosophy of race, problems which not only trouble scholars, but which haunt anyone who insists that the material of existence is the beginning and end of existence itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0e55e6635f2fa51e9933e6ab56db575ea724d0","amp;dn":"Levinas+Unhinged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0e55e6635f2fa51e9933e6ab56db575ea724d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,14,85,230,99,95,47,165,30,153,51,230,171,86,219,87,94,167,36,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
