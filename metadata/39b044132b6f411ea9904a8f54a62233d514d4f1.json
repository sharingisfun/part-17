Where We Belong\n\n  Like 2009's Manners, Passion Pit's sophomore outing is a fat thunderclap of soulful, echo-boom electro-pop that's as poisonous as it is precious, pounding out twinkling summer dance hymns that frame Michael Angelakos' elastic falsetto against a buttermilk sky thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secretly teeming with ominous storm clouds. With Gossamer, Angelakos' angst is pushed even further to the forefront, revealing an artist who doesn't just moonlight as a professional demon wrestler, but puts in a full day's work. Despite the flurry of pre-release woes (canceled shows, lengthy hospital stays, and the revelation of a botched, early suicide attempt, the latter of which is examined in great detail on the visceral and vulnerable closer &quot;Where We Belong&quot;), Gossamer is a triumph of youthful, bipolar tenacity that filters its manic energy through a cosmopolitan prism of pop avenues, from silky neo-soul (&quot;Constant Conversation&quot;) to shimmery JÃƒÂ³nsi-inspired synth pop (&quot;Take a Walk&quot;), the latter of which takes a third-person approach, weaving a tale of a husband and father's desperation in trying to make sense of his own actions in the midst of a recession's relentless, bloodied backhand. Angelakos' pathos aside, musically, Gossamer bristles with the kind of accessible pop luminosity that's usually relegated to barren Top 40 nonsense, but Angelakos and company know what constitutes a proper earworm, and effortless, infectious cuts like &quot;I'll Be Alright,&quot; &quot;Carried Away,&quot; &quot;It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy,&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Constant Conversation&quot; latch on to the cochlea like a Ridley Scott xenomorph with a taste for Fun., Phoenix, and the Lightning Seeds. Though the environment that birthed the appropriately titled Gossamer may be a bummer, the end product is winningly majestic as it is obviously spun by the most malevolent of spiders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b044132b6f411ea9904a8f54a62233d514d4f1","amp;dn":"Passion+Pit+-+Gossamer+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b044132b6f411ea9904a8f54a62233d514d4f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,176,68,19,43,111,65,30,169,144,74,143,84,166,34,51,213,20,212,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
