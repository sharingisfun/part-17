Their accomplishments as war correspondents are tracked to the present, including a study of the role they played post-September 11th.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPaperback: 275 pages\nPublisher: Routledge (April 22, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0415274451\nISBN-13: 978-0415274456\n\n-------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n-------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f0ffa48df5d3499eebdb34de676df715d71248","amp;dn":"Women+and+Journalism+by+Deborah+Chambers%2C+Linda+Steiner%2C+Carole+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f0ffa48df5d3499eebdb34de676df715d71248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,240,255,164,141,245,211,73,158,235,219,52,222,103,109,247,21,215,18,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
