All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.\n\nThe show is centered on five characters: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.\n\nOver time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's girlfriend (later his wife), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon on a dating website, and Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit.\n\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nBit rate                         : 872 Kbps\nWidth                            : 854 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161742a49b4eaf34a8541986b218df0028d5829e","amp;dn":"The+Big+Bang+Theory+480p+H264+AAC+Seasons+1+to+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161742a49b4eaf34a8541986b218df0028d5829e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,23,66,164,155,78,175,52,168,84,25,134,178,24,223,0,40,213,130,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
