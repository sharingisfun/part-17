Purists will cringe at the unabashed commercial concessions Guy makes on Heavy Love -- sure, he covers &quot;Midnight Train,&quot; but it's a duet with Johnny Lang, and it complements the funkified &quot;I Just Wanna Make Love to You,&quot; the psychedelicized licks, and the ZZ Top cover (&quot;I Need You Tonight&quot;) heard elsewhere. Nevertheless, Heavy Love works well when compared to the modern electric blues of the post-Stevie Ray Vaughan era, especially since Guy once again contributes some scorching solos. Granted, his playing may veer too close to rock for some tastes, but anyone wanting an uninhibited, hard rocking Buddy Guy record won't be disappointed with Heavy Love.
