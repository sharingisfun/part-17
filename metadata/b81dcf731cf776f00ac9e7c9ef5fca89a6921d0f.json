Originally to be released in 2004, the release date was pushed back to June 14, 2005 for unknown reasons. The album varies musically from their previous albums, with a rock sound to the album. Unlike previous albums, the album featured only live instruments.  The album's first single is &quot;Incomplete&quot;, and is followed by &quot;Just Want You To Know&quot;. The third single worldwide is &quot;I Still...&quot;. Other songs are &quot;Weird World&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Woman&quot; and &quot;Climbing The Walls&quot;. Never Gone has been certified as a platinum record in the U.S. It sold 293,000 copies during its first week of availability, and debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200. In Japan, it sold 528,000 copies and was second biggest western artist's album for 2005. It went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide. Never Gone was also released as a DualDisc. The DualDisc version features the music video for &quot;Incomplete&quot; and a short documentary showing the making of the video. It was also released in a CD and DVD double-disc edition. This is the final album that former member Kevin Richardson had involvement in, as one year after this album came out, he left to pursue other interests.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Tammy La Gorce - On Never Gone, the Backstreet Boys crib from the pop foundation they helped establish. Like a lot of smart popsters on the rebound, the reunited fab five broach their return by borrowing from the current hit makers. Even after a four-year hiatus, the flecks of new influence won't matter a bit to the fans. The boys' signature sugar-coated yearning softens every song to a melty consistency, and the lyrics haven't lost any of their babe-magnet pull. &quot;It's all so dark and mysterious/When the one you want doesn't want you,&quot; sing the chiseled Lotharios on &quot;Siberia.&quot; And on the final title track, a swirling crescendo sums up the sentiments of millions of heartsick, former teen devotees: &quot;Never gone, never far/In my heart is where you are.&quot;\n\n***I used OJOsoft_VOB_Converter_2.7.3.1204 to extract the music file from the dvd @ 320kbs and included it as track 15 on the listing.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Incomplete\n[02] Just Want You To Know\n[03] Crawling Back To You\n[04] Weird World\n[05] I Still...\n[06] Poster Girl\n[07] Lose It All\n[08] Climbing The Walls\n[09] My Beautiful Woman\n[10] Safest Place To Hide\n[11] Siberia\n[12] Never Gone\n[13] Song For The Unloved\n[14] Rush Over Me\n\n[15] Last Night You Saved My Life\n \nMusic Video\n\n[01] Incomplete [80mb]\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:58m:16s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 225mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Mpeg\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 14 June 2005\nRecord Company\t&gt; Zomba Recording\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.backstreetboys.com \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/b/bsb.html \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/backstreetboys \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; [Incomplete]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81dcf731cf776f00ac9e7c9ef5fca89a6921d0f","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Never+Gone+-+Backstreet+Boys+225mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81dcf731cf776f00ac9e7c9ef5fca89a6921d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,29,207,115,28,247,118,240,10,201,231,201,239,95,202,137,166,146,29,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
