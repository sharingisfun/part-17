The source appears to be the same master tapes used for the Lingasong (Germany)/RCA (Britain)/Atlantic (U.S.) Star-Club vinyl releases in 1977. This CD contains every song released from this performance (to the best of my knowledge). It also has a 24-page booklet with liner notes (all in Japanese) plus song lyrics in Japanese and English. Be-Bop-A-Lula and Hallelujah I Love Her So are sung by Horst Obber or Horst Fascher (depending on source) a German waiter/bouncer backed by the Beatles (he befriended them and served as their bodyguard while in Germany). Although Hully Gully is credited to the Beatles it is not them. This is also confirmed in Allen WienerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book &quot;The Beatles Ultimate Recording Guide&quot; as well as other sources. A few of the songs have a different &quot;sound or feel&quot; to them (&quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry&quot; and &quot;Sheila&quot; for example). Explanations put forth have included: 1. Different or incomplete mixing during the restoration process in 1976-1977, 2. This is a combination of at least two nights of recording done by &quot;Kingsize&quot; Taylor, 3. Some of the songs were recorded from different locations within the club. More than likely it is a combination of the final two explanations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdb0d96481ae24e3297f8a2f7e2a8a6b9a6da4ab","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+Live+At+The+Star+Club+In+Hamburg%2C+Germany+1962+%5Bflac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdb0d96481ae24e3297f8a2f7e2a8a6b9a6da4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,176,217,100,129,174,36,227,41,127,138,47,126,42,138,107,154,109,164,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
