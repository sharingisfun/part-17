Since then we became a bit more skilled, now we have\ndone over 3000 quality  releases, and we hope to bring you\nmore of them.\n\n\u0010 We are seeking for new talents:\n\n- Coders          \u0010 If you have any good experience and want\n- Crackers          to join us - read  CONTACT  section  for\n- GFX artists       details.\n- Keygenners\n- Suppliers       \u0010 There will be requirements.\n- Others?           And there will be cookies as well. :)\n\nNOTES\n\n\u0010 Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found\nsomething  suspicious, it's  a  problem  of  your security\nsoftware. All those  antivirus systems  will  never be too\nsmart, so don't complain.  And always remember that we are\nnot responsible for modified releases.\n\n\u0010 We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other\npeople and always  indicate  original authors of releases.\nWe have permissions to use their files.\n\n\u0010 We are doing all this for fun  and  knowledge only. Always\nremember to support the developers if you like the product\nand its quality.\n\nMEMBERS\n\n\u0010 420Gamer           [ gfxer, webdeveloper, trial ] +\n\n\u0010 apelord              [ coder, cracker, trial ] +\n\n\u0010 Astra                   [ tester, trial ] +\n\n\u0010 b0ne$natcheR               [ cracker, trial ] +\n\n\u0010 casanova                 [ cracker, trial ] +\n\n\u0010 Chanman                  [ gfxer, trial ] +\n\n\u0010 FrenFolio                [ coder, cracker ] +\n\n\u0010 Ignite                     [ cracker ] +\n\n\u0010 Illusion                 [ coder, cracker ] +\n\n\u0010 Liandri                [ supplier, founder ] +\n\n\u0010 Razor73                      [ sysop ] -\n\n\u0010 s2003r                [ cracker, supplier ] +\n\n\u0010 SupaSta                    [ supplier ] +\n\n\u0010 Sigma9o9                     [ sysop ] -\n\n\u0010 s0l_ir0n                 [ coder, cracker ] -\n\n\u0010 ViRUS               [ coder, cracker, trial ] +\n\nGREETINGS\n\n\u0010 Coffee Man    \u0010 Ghandi   \u0010 otti    \u0010 progopis    \u0010 ph0enix\n\n\u0010 rESin    \u0010 russiankid    \u0010 Soda Lastway    \u0010 Zerok\n\n\u0003 LnDL     \u0003 REVENGE     \u0003 TRiViUM     \u0003 TSRh     \u0003 UnderSEH\n\n\u0010 All friends and  great  people  who  always do their best.\n\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003INGS\n\n\u0010 CIY                 [ &gt;20 stolen releases ]\n\n\u0010 EyM                  [ 3 stolen releases ]\n\n\u0010 OUTLAWS         [ guys, no more please *facepalm* ]\n\n\u0010 SLAM                 [ 5 stolen releases ]\n\n\u0010 VACE                 [ 16 stolen releases ]\n\n\u0010 All other thieves, rippers, leechers, repackers, liars and\nselfish people.
