He'd beat that machine, or die with his hammer in his hand. We all know the outcome of that legendary contest. In this alternate history, however, John doesn't die in his heroic effort, but instead slips into a coma, only to awaken to his worst nightmare. A robotic uprising has occurred, and a new age has dawned - The Steam Age. Now, the only thing that can free the human race from the very machines they've created is John and his hammer. &quot;John Henry: The Steam Age&quot; is an exciting re-imagining of American folk hero John Henry in a SteamPunk setting.\n\n Please Seed and Enjoy ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a449eb0da41cdfdf9af1dabbc1ef2185a4146f","amp;dn":"John+Henry%3A+The+Steam+Age+%282012%29+Arcana+Studios","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a449eb0da41cdfdf9af1dabbc1ef2185a4146f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,164,73,235,13,164,28,223,223,154,241,218,187,193,239,33,133,164,20,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
