His hate is such that the gods intervene, cursing Shogo to experience love throughout the ages ultimately to have it ripped from his heart every time. From the Nazi atrocities of World War II to a dystopian future of human cloning, Shogo loses his heart, in so doing, healing the psychological scars of his childhood hatred.\n\nMaster storyteller Osamu Tezuka's Apollo's Song is a lyrical tour-de-force on the human spirit, the destruction of hate, and the triumph of love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4ca9de8b5fad03e8affafbfc82bd546cff4d7e","amp;dn":"Osamu+Tezuka+-+Apollo%27s+Song","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d4ca9de8b5fad03e8affafbfc82bd546cff4d7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,76,169,222,139,95,173,3,232,175,250,251,252,130,189,84,108,255,77,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
