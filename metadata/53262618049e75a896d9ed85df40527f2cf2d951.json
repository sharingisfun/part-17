The audio clips are things like:\n- Station idents\n- Announcements about in-game events (e.g. weather, travel)\n- General chatter\n- Phone-ins\n- Commercials\n- Programming (mostly songs)\nCommercials are not included with the main radio stations, but in a seperate file.&quot;\n\nSo by &quot;totally complete&quot;, I mean that I converted each .pak file into (in most cases) 3 .flac tracks, that go as follow :\n- a .flac track for all the tracks, [i]without intros nor outros[/i]\n- a .flac track for all the tracks, [i]with intros and outros[/i]\n- a .flac track for every host's intervention, that includes (in order) : intervention on any subject ; intervention about the time of the day ; phone calls ; weather reports ; station idents ; GTA world events.\n[b]Each track has a .cue sheet[/b], so that you can play the songs and the talks together, choose to have the intros/outros or not, or split the tracks up to your preferences. Each radio station comes tagged and has a folder picture.\n\nDetails :\n- I also added the adverts tracks, .flac + .cue + tagged.\n- SF-UR is the only station not to have clean song files, so there's only a intros/outros track.\n- WCTR is split up in 3 tracks, &quot;Interventions&quot; (only idents, in fact), The News and the Programs.\n- A few songs don't have any intro or outro.\n- Most songs have 2 maybe 3 intro and/or outro, but I thought it would be useless to upload 21GB of the same soundtrack just for a few intros.\n\n[b]Please note that my Internet upload speed is not that fast, so be patient, firsts downloaders![/b]\n\nI hope you'll enjoy! I'll be seeding for a long time.\n\n\nI advise you to use foobar2000's AutoPlaylist feature to melt those soundtracks and interventions to your own playlists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53262618049e75a896d9ed85df40527f2cf2d951","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+San+Andreas+%28GTA+SA%29+-+OST+%5BFLAC%5D+by+ConCQWZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53262618049e75a896d9ed85df40527f2cf2d951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,38,38,24,4,158,117,168,150,217,237,133,223,64,82,127,44,242,217,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
