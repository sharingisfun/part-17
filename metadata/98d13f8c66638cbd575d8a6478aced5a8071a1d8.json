Lined with palaces which were once holiday homes for Venetian nobility, they follow the route that Casanova and Lord Byron took to the city. After crossing the Venetian lagoon, Tim and Pru arrive at St Mark's Square, where they escape the busy Grand Canal and discover the tranquillity and beauty of the smaller canals that tourists rarely see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 17-Aug-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d13f8c66638cbd575d8a6478aced5a8071a1d8","amp;dn":"Great+Canal+Journeys+S05E01+PDTV.x264-TVC.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d13f8c66638cbd575d8a6478aced5a8071a1d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,209,63,140,102,99,140,189,87,93,138,100,120,172,237,90,128,113,161,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
