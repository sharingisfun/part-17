Plug the device into an USB port, wait a few seconds until it's being displayed in the USB Storage Devices list, check the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Enable Write ProtectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option and hit the Apply button.\n\nClose the application and that's it. Windows 7 users will have to unplug the device and then plug it back again in order to fully enable Write Protection, otherwise they won't see any major modification.\n\nAlthough there's no help file included in the application, the main window comprises all the information you will ever need when working with USB Write Protect, including detailed explanations of every section.\n\nOnce you're done with Write Protect and you wish to disable it, there's an option for this as well, so you just have to reopen the application and choose the dedicated tool.\n\nOf course, the application runs on all Windows versions out there without hampering computer performance at all, which means it can be safely used on older machines too.\n\nAll things considered, USB Write Protection could prove to be very useful if you wish to avoid deleting your data accidentally, but don't expect it to do wonders. It's still worth a chance though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e978f237249d1a1e3d6392438ebb5f513ce36b2","amp;dn":"USB+Write+Protect+by+GTecH-AG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e978f237249d1a1e3d6392438ebb5f513ce36b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,151,143,35,114,73,209,161,227,214,57,36,56,235,181,245,19,206,54,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
