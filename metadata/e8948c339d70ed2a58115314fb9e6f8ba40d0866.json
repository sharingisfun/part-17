Peterson is heard on four songs with bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen, while on the remaining eight, he heads a trio also including bassist Sam Jones and drummer Bob Durham. The emphasis throughout is on O.P.'s virtuosity and melodic improvisations. Although the release does not add anything surprising to Peterson's legacy, his playing is up to the level of his other sets of the period; highlights include &quot;Gravy Waltz,&quot; &quot;Three O'Clock In the Morning,&quot; an 11-minute exploration of &quot;Tenderly&quot; and even &quot;Put On a Happy Face.&quot;\n\nNote: Not my rip. I've added an info.txt file, cleaned up the ID Tags and compiled some scans. FLAC files are untouched.\n\nThe complete CD Boxed Set (minus this later release) is available here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9625501/Oscar_Peterson_-Exclusively_For_My_Friends_-_Boxed_Set_%5BFLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9625501/Oscar_Peterson_-Exclusively_For_My_Friends_-_Boxed_Set_%5BFLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8948c339d70ed2a58115314fb9e6f8ba40d0866","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+-+Exclusively+For+My+Friends+-+The+Lost+Tapes+%5BFL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8948c339d70ed2a58115314fb9e6f8ba40d0866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,148,140,51,157,112,237,42,88,17,83,20,251,158,111,139,164,13,8,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
