By 1990, Madchester and related music was becoming more mainstream, but Happy Daze's release helped to crystallise awareness of the new overall Madchester sound by featuring tracks from several different yet converging forces. Although all have the 'Madchester spirit', by no means all the bands were from Manchester, The Shamen and The Soup Dragons being Scottish, The Charlatans from Northwich and the Pixies not being British at all (though they were very much 'adopted' by Brits of the time).\n\nThis has been seen as a criticism of the album, along with the glaring omission of songs by New Order or The Stone Roses and for not anticipating the imminent arrival of Grunge music. However the album's mythical aura continues to inspire nostalgia in fans of Madchester era music with some bloggers still remembering the 'happy daze of 1989/1990' in a semi-conscious reference to this album.\n\nTrack listing\n\n01. &quot;Loaded&quot; - Primal Scream\n03. &quot;Come Home&quot; - James\n04. &quot;Big&quot; - New FADs\n05. &quot;Hippy Chick&quot; - Soho, the song featuring the distinctive sampled riff from The Smiths' recording &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;\n06. &quot;Velouria&quot; - The Pixies\n07. &quot;Taste&quot; - Ride\n08. &quot;She Comes in the Fall&quot; - Inspiral Carpets\n09. &quot;Groovy Train&quot; - The Farm\n10. &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; - The Charlatans\n11. &quot;Circle Square&quot; - The Wonder Stuff\n12. &quot;Sheriff Fatman&quot; - Carter USM\n13. &quot;ProGen&quot; - The Shamen\n14. &quot;Wrote For Luck&quot; - Happy Mondays\n15. &quot;I'm Free&quot; - Soup Dragons\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2263c6a8b965eb5f32b9ceabff6493e3b4b59fb1","amp;dn":"Happy+Daze+%5B1990%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2263c6a8b965eb5f32b9ceabff6493e3b4b59fb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,99,198,168,185,101,235,95,50,185,206,171,255,100,147,227,180,181,159,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
