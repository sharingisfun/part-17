It's remastered from tapes of two dutch radiostations who've been broadcasting this concert. The original recording was mono (they did not have stereo in 1951 or stereo was at least very rare in that period of time). The remaster makes it possible to enjoy the music through all your speakers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a85c798b45cd9f7237a04cadbf9d9e5c1a0ad78","amp;dn":"Kathleen+Ferrier+-+%28Gluck%29+Orpheo+ed+Euridice+-+Opera+in+3+acts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a85c798b45cd9f7237a04cadbf9d9e5c1a0ad78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,133,199,152,180,92,217,247,35,122,4,202,219,249,217,229,193,160,173,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
