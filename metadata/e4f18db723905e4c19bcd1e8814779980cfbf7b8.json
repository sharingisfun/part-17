He invented compounds\nlike loving kindness, and king of kings. Most of the King James AV\nedition of the bible is his. English speaking people use his phrases\nin every day speech without knowing their author.\n\nThe words: 'In the beginning was the word ...' are his.\n\nTyndale was a common man with controversial views. He believed\nthat the bible should be available to the people in the language\nthey spoke, rather interpreted for them by the few who knew Latin.\n\nHis studies showed him that the Latin texts were significantly\ndivergent from the original Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. He learnt\nthese languages with help from Dutch and Swiss non-conformists,\nand started translation into English. Completed parts were printed in\nWorms, Germany, and shipped to England. Most were intercepted\nand burnt. But some began to circulate in 'samizadt' form. This made \nhim a target. A 'fatwah' (or whatever the church called this kind of\npersecution) was declared against him.\n\nHe was captured, and interrogated. He was broken on the rack. When\nhe had nothing left to betray, he was strangled. His remains were then\nburnt.  His name was near lost to history. We know so much of him only\nbecause the records of his statements under torture later surfaced.\n\nThis is an academic documentary. Not religious. Not churchy. Nor\nanti-church. Nor flakey. Just dispassionate statement of history,\nand assessment of prose.\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f18db723905e4c19bcd1e8814779980cfbf7b8","amp;dn":"BBC+R3+Documentary+-+%5C%27Tyndale%5C%27s+Testament%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f18db723905e4c19bcd1e8814779980cfbf7b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,241,141,183,35,144,94,76,25,188,209,232,129,71,121,152,12,251,247,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
