Being Borned Again\n\nThe album is the culmination of a year filled with change and challenges for the Philadelphia based quartet including the addition of two new band members (Todd Ehrlich/bass and Mike Reilly/drums) and parting ways with their former label, among others .\n\nLeading the creative process independently has been a liberating experience for the band. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe self-produced alongside engineer John Lowe who was a truly great sounding board for us,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says songwriter, lead singer Sean Hoots. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOur recording sessions allowed us the time to focus, and the freedom to explore and come up with exactly what each song needed. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been performing several of these songs for over a year now, and had a pretty good read on what needed to happen in the studio by the\n\ntime we finally got there. I write songs with a very good idea of how things should sound front to back. We always add a few details here and there, but for the most part, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final before we even record,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he adds.\n\nThe albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ten tracks include many new instruments and sonic textures-- bringing electric guitar swells, piano, organ, choir vocals into the mix, along with the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature banjo, drums, vibraphone, mandolin and acoustic guitar trills.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSaltÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was produced entirely with support from Hoots &amp; HellmouthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fans via a Kickstarter fundraising campaign that was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œway more successful than we ever dreamed,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Sean. The album will be at retails beginning in October.\n\nHoots &amp; Hellmouth is Sean Hoots, Rob Berliner, Todd Ehrlich, Mike Reilly.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/11/07/hoots-and-hellmouth/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25bec9568bd0561bee2cbbdf17a50bb2cc436425","amp;dn":"Hoots+and+Hellmouth...Salt%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25bec9568bd0561bee2cbbdf17a50bb2cc436425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,190,201,86,139,208,86,27,238,44,187,223,23,165,11,178,204,67,100,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
