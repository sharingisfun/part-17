It was a marvelously well-equipped army, thanks to American inventiveness, know-how, and technical prowess, and by 1945 it lead the world in weaponry, strategic mobility and logistic capabilities. \nUS Army Handbook 1939-1945 is fully illustrated with a varied and exciting selection of contemporary action photographs.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on Facebook - Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/21b6/3f2e88be.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/21b6/3f2e88be.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e54e9f60df7627702d621b6fae7c642a8d652c7","amp;dn":"US+Army+Handbook+1939-1945%5BTeam+Nanban%5Dtmrg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e54e9f60df7627702d621b6fae7c642a8d652c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,84,233,246,13,247,98,119,2,214,33,182,250,231,198,66,168,214,82,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
