Now this amazing comedian delves deep inside to share the poignant story of his childhood and the people who shaped him into the strong, self-reliant man and ruthlessly funny comedian he is today.\n\nWhen Bernie was just sixteen, he lost his mother to cancer.\n\nA tough but loving teacher, she showered the unwilling boy with life lessons and &quot;Mac-isms&quot; that would later carry him through many hardships and give him strength during his slow rise to stardom. Maybe You Never Cry Again recounts this ascent in hilarious detail, from eight-year-old Bernie's stand-up comedy performance at a church dinner to open mike nights in Chicago, the jobs he juggled to make ends meet and eventually, his success in entertaining huge audiences on stage, in film, and on television.\n\nMaybe You Never Cry Again is a powerful testament to how a mother's love makes everything possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27f0049155052a46e7b005a8dd09cb3b5c585803","amp;dn":"Bernie+Mac+-+Maybe+You+Never+Cry+Again+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27f0049155052a46e7b005a8dd09cb3b5c585803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,240,4,145,85,5,42,70,231,176,5,168,221,9,203,59,92,88,88,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
