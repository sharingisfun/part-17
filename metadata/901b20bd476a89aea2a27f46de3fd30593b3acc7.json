Till now, like Murphy, Geissman has been a lighthearted, people pleasing entertainer; his three previous Bluemoon releases all caught airplay fire but sacrificed artistic growth for friendly compositional flair. No longer, as the acoustic guitarist grows in quantum leaps, forgoing that fluffy, sax driven jacuzzi jazz sound for such down home, creative and swinging elements as recorder, flute, upright bass and Charlie BisharatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s remarkable gypsy violin. BisharatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vibrant touches take GeissmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career to another level entirely. Stylistically, Geissman is all over the board, with Strunz &amp; Farah like naivete, saucy Latin, solid jazz and even a classical tour de force with flutist David Shostac. And yet that melodic guitar ties all the elements together. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilent MoviesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features wildly enchanting acoustic piano work from Emil Palame and Pat Coil. GeissmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plucky string dynamics have never shone brighter, and after years of strong but less ambitious pop, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at last found a way to reconcile true art with agreeable craftsmanship. The result: as organically brilliant an album as the smooth jazz genre has ever heard. \n\nGrant Geissman - Rustic Technology Track List: \n01  Gumbo \n02  Some EsplaininÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ To Do \n03  A Tune For J.T. \n04  Silent Movies \n05  Baroque \n06  Cold Blue Sake \n07  Chaco \n08  Time And Tides \n09  Three Conversations \n10  Strange Wine \n11  Flannel Cowboys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:901b20bd476a89aea2a27f46de3fd30593b3acc7","amp;dn":"Grant+Geissman+-+Rustic+Technology+%281993%29+%5BSmoothJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"901b20bd476a89aea2a27f46de3fd30593b3acc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,27,32,189,71,106,137,174,162,162,127,70,222,63,211,5,147,179,172,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
