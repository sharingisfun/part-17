Homepage: http://rufus.akeo.ie/\n\nRufus is an utility that helps format and create bootable USB flash drives, such as USB keys/pendrives, memory sticks, etc.\n\nIt can be especially useful for cases where:\n\n-you need to create USB installation media from bootable ISOs Windows,Linux,UEFI, etc.)\n-you need to work on a system that doesn't have an OS installed\n-you need to flash a BIOS or other firmware from DOS\n-you want to run a low-level utility\n\nDespite its small size, Rufus provides everything you need!\n\nOh, and Rufus is fast. For instance it's about twice as fast as UNetbootin, Universal USB Installer or Windows 7 USB download tool, on the creation of a Windows 7 USB installation drive from an ISO. It is also marginally faster on the creation of Linux bootable USB from ISOs.\n\nSupported Languages:\nDeutsch, ÃŽâ€¢ÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ»ÃŽÂ·ÃŽÂ½ÃŽÂ¹ÃŽÂºÃŽÂ¬, English, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, FranÃƒÂ§ais, Italiano, LietuviÃ…Â³, Magyar, Netherlands, Polski, ÃÂ Ã‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹, RomÃƒÂ¢nÃ„Æ’, SlovenÃ…Â¡Ã„ï¿½ina, TÃƒÂ¼rkÃƒÂ§e, Ã¦Â­Â£Ã©Â«â€Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦â€“â€¡, Ã­â€¢Å“ÃªÂµÂ­Ã¬â€“Â´.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0d288bd22f0a8a3806040c84807c2a706b6228b","amp;dn":"Rufus+-+Create%2C+format+bootable+USB+drives+the+easy+way+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0d288bd22f0a8a3806040c84807c2a706b6228b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,210,136,189,34,240,168,163,128,96,64,200,72,7,194,167,6,182,34,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
