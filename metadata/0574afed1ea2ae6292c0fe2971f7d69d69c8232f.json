He was widely regarded as &quot;Britain's greatest living travel writer&quot; during his lifetime, based on books such as A Time of Gifts (1977). A BBC journalist once described him as &quot;a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene.&quot;\n\nAt the age of 18, Leigh Fermor decided to walk the length of Europe, from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople. He set off on 8 December 1933, less than a year after Hitler had come to power in Germany, with a few clothes, several letters of introduction, the Oxford Book of English Verse and a volume of Horace's Odes. He slept in barns and shepherds' huts, but also was invited by landed gentry and aristocracy into the country houses of Central Europe. He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way. Two of his later travel books, A Time of Gifts (1977) and Between the Woods and the Water (1986), were about this journey. A book on the final part of his journey was unfinished at the time of Leigh Fermor's death, but was published as The Broken Road: Travels from Bulgaria to Mount Athos in September 2013 by John Murray. The book draws on Leigh Fermor's diary at the time and on an early draft he wrote in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1950, Leigh Fermor published his first book, The Traveller's Tree, about his post-war travels in the Caribbean. The book won the Heinemann Foundation Prize for Literature and established his career path, although it has received negative attention for its approach to racial issues. It was quoted extensively in Live and Let Die, by Ian Fleming. He went on to write several further books of his journeys, including Mani and Roumeli, of his travels on mule and foot around remote parts of Greece.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe torrent contains all following books in ePUB format:\n\n* A Time of Gifts (1977), NYRB Classics\n\n* A Time to Keep Silence (1957), NYRB Classics\n\n* Between the Woods and the Water (1986), NYRB Classics\n\n* Mani (1958), NYRB Classics\n\n* The Traveller's Tree (1950), NYRB Classics\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRead the following articles, interviews, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leigh_Fermor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leigh_Fermor&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2223154/Dashing-hero--champion-sponger-PATRICK-LEIGH-FERMOR-AN-ADVENTURE-BY-ARTEMIS-COOPER.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-2223154/Dashing-hero--champion-sponger-PATRICK-LEIGH-FERMOR-AN-ADVENTURE-BY-ARTEMIS-COOPER.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8568395/Sir-Patrick-Leigh-Fermor.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/special-forces-obituaries/8568395/Sir-Patrick-Leigh-Fermor.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0574afed1ea2ae6292c0fe2971f7d69d69c8232f","amp;dn":"Patrick+Leigh+Fermor+-++British+Traveler+%285+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0574afed1ea2ae6292c0fe2971f7d69d69c8232f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,116,175,237,30,162,174,98,146,192,254,41,113,247,214,157,105,200,35,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
