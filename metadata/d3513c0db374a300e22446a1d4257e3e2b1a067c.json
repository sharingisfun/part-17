She later called Jacks to accompany her on rhythm guitar for one of her live performances and eventually, with the addition of Craig McCaw on lead guitar, Susan decided to dedicate all her time to the trio. Craig McCaw introduced Satwant Singh on tablas and they became the Poppy Family. The name was chosen when Susan, Terry and Craig were searching for a new name and came across it in the dictionary. Susan and Terry were married in 1967 and Susan Pesklevits became Susan Jacks.\n\nWith Susan Jacks on vocals and Terry Jacks on rhythm guitar, along with musicians Craig McCaw (guitar/sitar) and Satwant Singh (tablas/drums), the group recorded their first album, from which came their best known song &quot;Which Way You Goin' Billy?&quot; (No. 1 in Canada and No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts) which was a worldwide hit. Their second and last album Poppy Seeds was recorded with studio musicians after Terry Jacks released Craig and Satwant from the group. Later hits included &quot;That's Where I Went Wrong&quot; (#9, also #27 US), 'Where Evil Grows' (#6, also #45 US), and `Good Friends?'(#10, also &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; the US chart). In the United States &quot;Which Way You Goin' Billy?&quot; and &quot;That's Where I Went Wrong&quot; were both Top 10 Adult Contemporary chart hits as well; &quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; and &quot;Good Friends?&quot; both also hit the US AC chart. The Poppy Family's first two Canadian releases were &quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot; (#75 in 1968), &quot;What Can The Matter Be?&quot; (#53 in 1969). Other releases included &quot;I Was Wondering&quot; (#10 in 1971, also US #100) and &quot;No Good To Cry&quot; (#8 in 1972), &quot;I'll See You There&quot; and &quot;Tryin'&quot;.\n\nAt their career peak, Susan performed &quot;Which Way You Goin' Billy?&quot; on Bobby Darin's 1970 television variety special, The Darin Invasion. They also appeared on other variety shows including Rollin' On The River with Kenny Rogers and The George Kirby Special. Although Susan enjoyed performing live, Terry was not interested and their career ultimately suffered.\n\nThe &quot;Which Way You Goin' Billy?&quot; single earned the group two 1970 Gold Leaf (Juno) Awards as well as two Moffatt Awards in 1970. The Juno Award is Canada's equivalent of the Grammy Award. The single version of &quot;Which Way You Goin' Billy&quot; went on to sell a total of more than 3Ã‚Â½ million worldwide, and was awarded a gold disc.[1]\n\nThe Poppy Family disbanded in 1972 and, Susan and Terry separated, later releasing two solo albums, Terry Jacks' Seasons in the Sun and Susan Jacks' I Thought of You Again.\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n1.&quot;Beyond the Clouds&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:37\n2.&quot;Free From the City&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\n3.&quot;What Can the Matter Be?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:16\n4.&quot;Which Way You Goin' Billy?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:23\n5.&quot;Happy Island&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:53\n6.&quot;There's No Blood In Bone&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n7.&quot;A Good Thing Lost&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:03\n8.&quot;You Took My Moonlight Away&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:43\n9.&quot;Shadows On My Wall&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n10.&quot;That's Where I Went Wrong&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:32\n11.&quot;Where Evil Grows&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:51\n12.&quot;I Was Wondering&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n13.&quot;Tryin'&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:02\n14.&quot;Winter Milk&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n15.&quot;Good Friends?&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:39\n16.&quot;I'll See You There&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:20\n17.&quot;You Don't Know What Love Is&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:49\n18.&quot;I Thought Of You Again&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n19.&quot;Another Year, Another Day&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:35\n20.&quot;Evil Overshadows Joe&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:29\n21.&quot;That's Where I Went Wrong&quot; (U.S. Version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:33\n\n\nCD RIP\n\n256 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3513c0db374a300e22446a1d4257e3e2b1a067c","amp;dn":"The+Poppy+Family+-+A+Good+Thing+Lost+%5B1968-1973%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3513c0db374a300e22446a1d4257e3e2b1a067c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,81,60,13,179,116,163,0,226,36,70,161,212,37,126,62,43,26,6,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
