It tells a love story troubled by incest.  But more: it is also at once a fairy tale, epic, philosophical treatise on the nature of time, parody of the history of the novel, and erotic catalogue. Ada, or Ardor is no less than the supreme work of an imagination at white heat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a06b5ae47e68c8a406f535bf3e732ad4ed31ae3","amp;dn":"Ada%2C+or+Ardor%3A+A+Family+Chronicle+by+Vladimir+Nabokov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a06b5ae47e68c8a406f535bf3e732ad4ed31ae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,6,181,174,71,230,140,138,64,111,83,91,243,231,50,173,78,211,26,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
