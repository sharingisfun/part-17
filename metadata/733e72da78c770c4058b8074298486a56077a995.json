Because science is so central to life in the 21st century, science educators and other leaders of the scientific community believe that it is essential that &quot;everyone&quot; understand the basic concepts of the most vital and far-reaching disciplines. &quot;Nanotechnology 101&quot; does exactly that. This accessible volume provides readers -- whether students new to the field or just interested members of the lay public -- with the essential ideas of the new science of nanotechnology using a minimum of jargon and mathematics. Concepts are introduced in a progressive order so that more complicted ideas build on simpler ones, and each is discussed in small, bite-sized segments so that they can be more easily understood.\r\n\r\n&quot;Nanotechnology 101&quot; provides contemporary topics about the infusion of nanotechnology in the areas of the environment, food safety, medicine and healthcare, consumer goods, agriculture, homeland security, and energy supply. With a bibliography, sidebars, and interviews with leading figures in the field, &quot;Nanotechnology 101&quot; provides the perfect starting point for anyone wishing to understand this burgeoning science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:733e72da78c770c4058b8074298486a56077a995","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+101+-+John+Mongillo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"733e72da78c770c4058b8074298486a56077a995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,62,114,218,120,199,112,196,5,139,128,116,41,132,134,165,96,119,169,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
