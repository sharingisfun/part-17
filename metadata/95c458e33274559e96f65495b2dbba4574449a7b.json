The plague of our day, terrorism, begins with the word terror. Fear, it seems, has taken up a hundred-year lease on the building next door and set up shop. Oversized and rude, fear herds us into a prison of unlocked doors. Wouldn't it be great to walk out?\r\n\r\nImagine your life, wholly untouched by angst. What if faith, not fear, was your default reaction to threats? If you could hover a fear magnet over your heart and extract every last shaving of dread, insecurity, or doubt, what would remain? Envision a day, just one day, where you could trust more and fear less.\r\nCan you imagine your life without fear?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c458e33274559e96f65495b2dbba4574449a7b","amp;dn":"Fearless%3A+Imagine+Your+Life+Without+Fear","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c458e33274559e96f65495b2dbba4574449a7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,196,88,227,50,116,85,158,150,246,84,149,178,219,186,69,116,68,154,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
