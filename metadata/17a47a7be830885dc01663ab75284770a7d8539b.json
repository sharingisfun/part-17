As I look at pop culture, I do not think we have ever been quite as bad as we are now when it comes to crap passing for entertainment. The fact that even five people, much less millions, think that Will Ferrell or Jack Black are comedic geniuses is depressing to me. If anyone reading this is under about 30, take a stab at some of the great comedy films of the 60s and 70s ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ back when classically trained Oscar-winning actors who had quality direction and decent scripts churned out a few of the best ones ever made. Sure, they made crap back then too, but they called it a B movie and showed it on drive-in screens.

The film was directed by Richard Quine, who also directed Lemmon in My Sister Eileen, It Happened to Jane, Operation Mad Ball and Bell, Book and Candle.\n\nPlot summary\n\nJack Lemmon plays handsome bachelor Stanley Ford, a successful cartoonist who is happily unmarried and enjoying all the creature comforts one could desire, including a wonderful valet, Charles Firbank (Terry-Thomas), who takes care of all his material needs. Stanley lives a carefree life as a single man, attending wild parties and chasing attractive young women etc. However, fate soon intervenes: whilst attending a friend's bachelor party, Stanley becomes very drunk. When the would-be groom calls off his wedding, Stanley drunkenly proposes to a beautiful blonde Italian girl dressed in a swim-suit, who has just stepped out of a large cake. An equally drunken judge (Sidney Blackmer) at the party overhears Stanley's marriage proposal and obligingly performs an impromptu (but legally binding) wedding ceremony. Next morning, Stanley wakes up with a hangover. Lying in bed next to him is the beautiful woman (Lisi) who stepped out of the cake at the party. At first he remembers nothing of the previous night's events. Then, the awful truth begins to dawn on him. To make matters worse, his new wife speaks no English, which makes communicating with her something of a challenge. He tries to get the marriage annulled, but his lawyer informs him that this is impossible.\n\nMarriage takes Stanley's life and turns it completely upside down. His new wife quickly begins to make certain changes to his lifestyle which causes friction with Stanley's valet. Stanley even changes the cartoon he writes (Bash Brannigan) and shifts it from a secret agent to a household comedy. After becoming increasingly irritated by the various changes that marriage has made to his life, Stanley vents his frustrations by concocting a plot, in his daily comic strip at least, to kill his wife and dispose of the body &quot;in the goop from the gloppitta-gloppitta machine&quot;.\n\nStanley's wife sees the cartoon on his work-desk, takes offense and leaves without a trace. Questions are asked, and after reading the offending cartoon the police put two and two together and make five. Ford is quickly arrested and accused of murdering his wife and disposing of the body. His cartoons are used as prosecution evidence at the subsequent trial. After his attorney does a thoroughly incompetent job of defending him, Stanley fires him and defends himself. He ends up telling the jury that he did indeed murder his wife, and that they should acquit him on the grounds of justifiable homicide. The all-male jury is sympathetic because they themselves are frustrated at the way their respective wives have taken all the fun out of their lives. In a gesture of protest and defiance, the jury deliberately finds Stanley not guilty and he is acquitted, released and carried shoulder high out of the court room, whilst all the women look on in stony silence.\n\nThe movie has a happy ending of sorts when Stanley's wife returns and they are reconciled. Stanley has gradually realised that he really does love his wife, and that life is far sweeter with her than without her. His disapproving butler Charles is introduced to her very attractive mother who, like Charles, has a space between her teeth. The underlying message is that love will conquer all.\n\nThe comic strip\nThe comic strip art in the film was credited to Mel Keefer. Alex Toth did a teaser comic that ran in the Hollywood Reporter and several newspapers for ten days as advertising for the film.\n\nCast\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tJack Lemmon as Stanley Ford \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tVirna Lisi as Mrs. Ford \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tTerry-Thomas as Charles Firbank \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tEddie Mayehoff as Harold Lampson, Stanley's envious lawyer \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tClaire Trevor as Edna Lampson, Harold's shrewish wife \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tMary Wickes as Harold's secretary \nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tJack Albertson as Dr. Bentley \n\nTrivia\n \t\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢\tVirna Lisi admitted that she had a big crush on Jack Lemmon and that she found it very easy to kiss and cuddle him in the film.
