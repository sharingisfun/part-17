Kayla is determined to master her new-found abilities as a wild magic witch. She's learning everything she can so she and her betrothed, Rane, can put a stop to the sorcerers who are recklessly gathering their power, building up their magic to take each other on in a war that will destroy the countries of Middleland. An even more unlikely sorcerer . . . Mirabelle's father was one of the greatest sorcerers in Middleland, but when he used the magic in the silver pear to bespell his pregnant wife to give birth to the greatest sorcerer who would ever live, he never thought that child would be a girl. Mirabelle is nothing like a usual sorcerer, confounding every expectation, and when she comes to the rescue of Rane's brother, Soren, she makes a decision few sorcerers would. She saves him, rather than herself, losing the silver pear in the process. And using magic always exacts a price . . . With war not just a possibility but simply a matter of time, there are no neutral parties and no fence-sitters in Kayla and Mirabelle's new world. Everyone is either an ally or an enemy and there is a price to pay for everything. The question is, how high will it be? The Silver Pear is the sequel to The Golden Apple, and together they form The Dark Forest series\n\nPublisher: Michelle Diener (29 September 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 099245591X\nISBN-13: 978-0992455910\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0d0a1129366117051137ec37c8f81596a79f27","amp;dn":"%5BMichelle+Diener%5DThe+Silver+Pear+%28The+Dark+Forest%29%28azw%2C+epub%2C+lr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0d0a1129366117051137ec37c8f81596a79f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,13,10,17,41,54,97,23,5,17,55,236,55,200,248,21,150,167,159,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
