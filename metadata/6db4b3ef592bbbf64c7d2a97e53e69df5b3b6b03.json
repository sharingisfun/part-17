Shape the world around you with every decision you make and through every dialogue with your crew. Meridian: New World offers countless options to devise your own strategy, including various equipment options for your units and special abilities for you to rely upon. Use your abilities anywhere on the battlefield and turn the tide of battle by weakening the enemy troops. Alternatively take the covert approach and sabotage the enemy power supply to shut down their production. You can rely entirely on researching superior weapons or special abilities. Or you can risk building a large economy, constructing a massive army from your enormous resources. The strategy you use and how many troops you sacrifice to reach your goal will influence the attitude of your crew towards you. Are you ready to shape the history of galactic colonization?\r\n\r\nBrought to you as the brainchild of Ede Tarsoly - the sole man behind Elder Games - Meridian: New World was mostly received with disbelief and awe at the fact that it's a one-man production. While it remains true that Ede is the source of every detail of the game, some assets were created by his friends BalÃ¡zs BodnÃ¡r, TamÃ¡s GyermÃ¡n and GÃ¡bor MenyhÃ¡rt, who are credited with their contribution.\r\n\r\nUnique mix of classic real time strategy and role playing elements, set in a beautiful 3D science fiction setting\r\nMeaningful dialogue choices that shape the story and the game world\r\nUse your own individual strategy to defeat your enemies: Will you gain strength through trade or through research? Do you overwhelm your enemies through sheer force or do you use stealth techniques to defeat them?\r\nA one-man production with incredible scope and attention to detail\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: OS: Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, Processor: 2.5Ghz single core, Memory: 2 GB RAM, Graphics: nVidia GeForce 8600 GT / ATI 2600 Pro, DirectX: Version 10, Hard Drive: 830 MB available space, Sound Card: Required, Additional Notes: Intel integrated graphics processors are unsupported","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db4b3ef592bbbf64c7d2a97e53e69df5b3b6b03","amp;dn":"Meridian%3A+New+World++%28v2.1.0.4%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6db4b3ef592bbbf64c7d2a97e53e69df5b3b6b03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,180,179,239,89,43,187,246,76,125,42,151,229,62,105,223,91,59,107,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
