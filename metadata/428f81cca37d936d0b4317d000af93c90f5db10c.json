And we?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢re\nnot talking skin flaws, dinky dust\nbunnies or even the odd bit of\nlitter here and there, we mean\npretty huge objects and areas.\nSure, zoom in and interrogate\nPhotoshop?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s doings and it?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s\nnever going to be absolutely\nperfect, but it?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a pretty\nimpressive addition and a great\ntime-saver, even if for just giving\nyou a head start.\nImproved Edge Selection\nThis may not be a biggy to those\nwho?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve already invested in a\nreliable plug-in such as Fluid\nMask or Mask Pro (thinking\nabout it... what are those guys\ngoing to do now their market\nhas been snatched away from\nthem?) but CS5 sees big\nimprovements to the Refine Edge\nfeature and, in particular, its\nEdge Detection capabilities.\nThere?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s nothing particularly\nradical here other than it?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a\nnative feature, it?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s reliable and it\ndoes the job.\nSpeaking of old, trusty plug-ins, the same goes for the new HDR Pro feature. Rather than auto stack and combine multiple exposures, however, Photoshop CS5 now offers users more control over the HDR merging process. HDR can either be fairly subtle or highly surreal and as well as greater control over the image output HDR Pro also gives users the chance to save style presets for quick fixes once you?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve found an effect that suits\nyou. Mixer Brush and Bristle Tips There?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s always been a gap in the Creative Suite for decent painting tools, and with Corel pinching part of the digital artist market with its successful Painter program it really was missing a trick for a long time. Now though, with the new Mixer Brush and a Bristle Tips feature it?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s possible to blend colors, much like Painter. As well as allowing painters the ability to control the wetness of canvas colors, load and mixing rates it?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s also possible to determine whether the brush is refilled or cleaned after each painting stroke.\n\n\nPuppet Warp\nAnother feature previewed\nbefore the main launch, Puppet\nWarp gives users the opportunity\nto push and pull elements within\nan image. More impressive is the\nfact you can define a stacking\norder of different pin markers.\nAdobe Evangelist, Russell\nBrown?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Sneak Peak is definitely\nworth taking a look at to see\nhow this feature could be used\nconstructively.\nBooster features\nOf course, there are plenty more\nfeatures introduced to\nPhotoshop CS5 that should\nprovide improved workflow tools\nto photographers and designers\nalike., including:\nThe introduction of Adobe Raw 6\nplug-in\nAutomated lens correction\n(custom profiles for correcting\nlens distortion)\n3D extrusions with Adobe\nRepoussÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (Photoshop CS5\nExtended only)\nImproved 3D realism and rich\nmaterials (Photoshop CS5\nExtended only)\nBetter black-and-white photo\nconversion\nMini Adobe Bridge for use in-\nprogram\nA special mention should also go\nto the fact both Photoshop CS5\nand CS5 Extended now offer\ncross-platform 64-bit native\nsupport.\nInstallation\n1. Run Setup.exe\n2. Extract required crack (32 or\n64) from rar and copy into the\nDirectory stated in the READ ME\nfile included.SEED PLZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:428f81cca37d936d0b4317d000af93c90f5db10c","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CS5+Extended+%28x86%2Bx64%29+100+Working","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"428f81cca37d936d0b4317d000af93c90f5db10c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,143,129,204,163,125,147,109,11,67,23,208,0,175,147,201,15,93,177,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
