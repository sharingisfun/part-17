Williams' smoky tenor voice and finger-picked guitar are the main instruments on the album, and additional embellishments are used effectively for periodic changes of pace. The real stars, though, are Williams' songs -- often introspective and serious, filled with images of nature and the American landscape, rich in poetic metaphor, and always well-crafted. Across the Winterline is a quiet, understated gem. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/25/jack-williams/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/25/jack-williams/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92225e07e2ac33e84db91f8b30e1c0c904337f43","amp;dn":"Jack+Williams...Across+the+Winterline%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92225e07e2ac33e84db91f8b30e1c0c904337f43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,34,94,7,226,172,51,232,77,185,31,139,48,225,192,201,4,51,127,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
