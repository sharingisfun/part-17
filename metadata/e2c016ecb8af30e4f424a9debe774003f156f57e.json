Summer is a time for music and celebration in Portugal, where music festivals are held all across the country. Filmmaker Gomes has decided one of his many upcoming projects should be a movie about the festival season, but he and his producers have a hard time deciding if they should make a documentary or a drama, even though Gomes has already chosen his protagonists either way -- vocalist TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢nia (SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³nia Bandeira) and guitarist HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lder (FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡bio Oliveira), who are young, attractive, and attracted to one another. As TÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢nia and HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lder find love in the Portuguese countryside, the sound of various forms of music, from rock to classical, fills the air and Gomes and his crew try to get their project off the ground, be it a musical, a fact-based drama, or a horror film (which he's also been considering). Aquele Querido MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªs de Agosto (aka Our Beloved Month of August) was an official selection at the 2009 Rotterdam International Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi.\n\n------\n\nRotten Tomatoes review (http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/our_beloved_month_of_august/)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c016ecb8af30e4f424a9debe774003f156f57e","amp;dn":"Aquele+Querido+Mes+de+Agosto+%28Miguel+Gomes%2C+2008%29+DVD%2C+PAL%2C+VOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c016ecb8af30e4f424a9debe774003f156f57e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,192,22,236,184,175,48,228,244,36,169,222,190,119,64,3,241,86,245,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
