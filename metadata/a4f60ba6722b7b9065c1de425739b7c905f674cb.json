Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuest: Artie Lange\n\nEpisode 227: Artie Lange sits with Anthony to talk about growing up a Stern fan, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“radio warÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between O&amp;A and Stern, shitbag fans, over sharing during shows, and becoming successful against the odds. They commiserate about being PC, the assholes on-line, SiriusXM, Artie talks about joining Howard SternÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s show, his shitty agents, tripping into stripper pussy, being a total fuck-up, and the effects of heroin. Artie then tells stories of arrests and police run-ins, leaving the Stern show, doing an incredible amount of drugs, losing friends because of drugs, real friends versus Ã¢â‚¬Å“show friends,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and they talk about being motivated. The guys chat about acting their age, relationships, gambling, getting advice from professionals, the necessity of school, getting bitches, meeting parents, Beetlejuice, wacky radio contests, and Artie coming out to George Takei. They banter about an Ã¢â‚¬Å“old-timey hemorrhoid,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Artie tells some stories about his childhood, his family, and his first stand-up show, they discuss comedy friends, comedy haters, Nick DiPaolo, Tough Crowd, Donald Trump, PC politics, changing comedy for different countries, Gilbert Gottfried, and getting approval from the mainstream. TACS comes to a close with the guys covering corporate life, feeling invincible, doing live reads, on-air bashing, the differences between podcasting and radio, rebelling against management, and sobriety.\n\n\n\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f60ba6722b7b9065c1de425739b7c905f674cb","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-09-10+Artie+Lange+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f60ba6722b7b9065c1de425739b7c905f674cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,246,11,166,114,43,123,144,101,193,222,66,87,57,183,201,5,246,116,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
