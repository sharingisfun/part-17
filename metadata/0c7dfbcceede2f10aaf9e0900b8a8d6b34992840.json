Everyone wants to know what the ultimate nature of the world is, what the self is, whether we have free will, how our minds relate to our bodies, whether we can really know anything, where ethical truth comes from, what the meaning of life is, and whether or not there is a God. This inner philosopher is related to the inner child, since the child too is prone to asking philosophical questions. But it is much better to have a disciplined guide through philosophy than simply to try to do all the thinking by yourself. I will be acting as your guide. I will cover all the main problems of philosophy, from logic to ethics, from the human mind to God, introducing you to how philosophers think and the theories they have come up with. The first four lectures focus on foundational questions that need to be clarified before we engage upon more applied discussions. We need to know what knowledge is, what truth is, and what logical reasoning is before we start discussing ethics, the mind, free will and God. So letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s start with the basics, then break into a run only when we have learned how to walk.\nColin McGinn was educated at Oxford University, where he won the prestigious John Locke prize and later taught before moving on to UCLA. He is currently a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University. McGinn regularly writes newspaper and magazine articles and is the author of numerous books, including philosophical works, fiction, and an autobiographical book, the acclaimed The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy.\n\nLecture 1\tSkepticism: What Do You Really Know?\t\n\nLecture 2\tKnowledge: How Should Knowledge Be Analyzed?\t\n\nLecture 3\tTruth: What Is the Nature of Truth?\n\nLecture 4\tLogic: What Is Valid Reasoning?\t\n\nLecture 5\tKnowledge and Experience: Where Does Knowledge Come From?\n\nLecture 6\tThe Basis of Ethics: What Makes Something Right or Wrong?\t\n\nLecture 7\tHappiness and Right Action: How Are Morality and Human Welfare Related?\t\n\nLecture 8\tMorality and Blame: Are We Free?\t\n\nLecture 9\tMind and Body: How Are They Related? \n\nLecture 10\tConsciousness: Can the Mystery Be Solved?\t\n\nLecture 11\tMind and World: Are Objects Really as They Appear? \n\nLecture 12\tThe Self: Who Am I?\t\n\nLecture 13\tGod: Can the Existence of God Be Proved?\t\n\nLecture 14\tThe Meaning of Life: What Gives Human\n\n=========================================================\n\n&quot;Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, \nand the life of the candle will not be shortened.&quot;\n\n\n-- KNOWLEDGE never decreases by being shared!!\n\n\nShow your Thankfulness by seeding :)\n\n=========================================================\n\n\nIf you can afford,\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Modern-Scholar-Discovering-Philosopher-Philosophy/dp/B001GN35SE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Modern-Scholar-Discovering-Philosopher-Philosophy/dp/B001GN35SE&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.learnoutloud.com/Audio-Books/Philosophy/Ancient-and-Medieval-Philosophy/Discovering-the-Philosopher-in-You/3489&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.learnoutloud.com/Audio-Books/Philosophy/Ancient-and-Medieval-Philosophy/Discovering-the-Philosopher-in-You/3489&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7dfbcceede2f10aaf9e0900b8a8d6b34992840","amp;dn":"Discovering+the+Philosopher+in+You+-+Big+Questions+in+Philosophy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7dfbcceede2f10aaf9e0900b8a8d6b34992840","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,125,251,204,238,222,47,16,170,249,224,144,11,138,141,107,52,153,40,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
