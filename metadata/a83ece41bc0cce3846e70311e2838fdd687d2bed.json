So I recoded both parts making them AVI files. They're coded using the XVid codec, at 720x406, 30 fps. I've included both parts of this documentary in this one torrent. Also, no silly RARs that don't provide any benefit, and needlessly increase the size of the torrent.\n\nThanks goes to the original uploader.\nThePirateBay.org Rocks!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a83ece41bc0cce3846e70311e2838fdd687d2bed","amp;dn":"Stephen+Hawking+and+the+Theory+of+Everything","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a83ece41bc0cce3846e70311e2838fdd687d2bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,62,206,65,188,12,206,56,70,231,3,17,226,131,143,221,104,125,43,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
