Each has a special reason to compete - and each must win. Among the racers are two brothers in a stolen, pimped-out Cadillac that carries secrets of its own, a man trying to find his missing wife, a scientist and his teenage daughter, and others. No one knows who they&amp;#039;re racing or where the finish line is, so anything is possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc463ec38dd545fc4edf083b0832fc84e2effa0e","amp;dn":"DRIVE.S01E01.Starting.Line.HDTV.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc463ec38dd545fc4edf083b0832fc84e2effa0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,70,62,195,141,213,69,252,78,223,8,59,8,50,252,132,226,239,250,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
