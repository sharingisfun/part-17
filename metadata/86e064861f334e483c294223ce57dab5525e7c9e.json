These instructors were drawn from the former ranks of the U.S. Army&amp;#039;s DELTA force, the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;#039;s top-secret security service, and some of America&amp;#039;s most active law enforcement SWAT teams. Each instructor came to Hawk East, Inc.&amp;#039;s training program with special talents and skills as the country&amp;#039;s best teachers. The VIP Protection Specialist Training Course comes from this program. Most on-site VIP Protection Specialist training courses cost thousands of dollars to attend.
