Since 1991, only a few bands (e.g. Zdob Ãƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸i Zdub), managed to occupy solid positions on the show-business arena of the Republic of Moldova and abroad.\n\nAlternosfera first rehearsed with their full lineup on December 13, 1998. Their first concert was on November 23, 1999 in ChiÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸inÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™u. In 2001, the band did their first demo recordings in ChiÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸inÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™u, followed by more demo recordings in 2002 in Bucharest, Romania.\n\nBoth the lineup and musical direction have changed over time, as the band reached maturity and developed their own approach to alternative rock, with the keyboards &quot;carrying&quot; the entire tune. Their lyrics are most often about love, but also have social and political connotations. Alternosfera sound is unique on the Moldovan market at the moment, their influences varying from 80's motifs to the Seattle alternative rock of the '90s. Some people claim that the sounding of guitar in their songs is similar to Nirvana's one.\n\nMarcel Bostan's voice is rich in modulation, having a well-developed and thoroughly practised lyric line and also the ability to go very &quot;high&quot;.[citation needed] Their specific melodiousness is also partly because most songs have the classic piano &quot;lead&quot;.\n\nAlternosfera have performed on most of ChiÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸inÃƒâ€žÃ†â€™u's stages, taking part in the most important rock festivals in Moldova and always well received by the public. Recently (2005) they performed in the Tuborg festival in Bucharest.\n\nMembers:\nMarcel Bostan - Vocals, lyrics\nMarin Nicoara - Guitar\nVitalie Chian - Keyboards\nVlad Hohlov - Drums\nDumitru Costin - Bass\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26deb1810163c8fc8b5db091fdcb561be74fa3c7","amp;dn":"Alternosfera+-+Visatori+Cu+Plumb+In+Ochi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26deb1810163c8fc8b5db091fdcb561be74fa3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,222,177,129,1,99,200,252,139,93,176,145,253,203,86,27,231,79,163,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
