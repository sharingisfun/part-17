Even though I can&amp;#039;t deny that this wasn&amp;#039;t him at his best, John Constantine is and angry and distant character, so Reeves couldn&amp;#039;t display much emotion. All in all, he didn&amp;#039;t do too bad. \n\nRachel Weisz was the star of the movie, giving a heartfelt performance. Gavin Rossdale was good, playing the bad guy card too perfection. And Djimon Housan, and Tilda Swinton were also great in their small roles. Shia LeBlouf, like Reeves, could have done a little better. Peter Stormare was perfect as Satan and my favorite character. He added a bit of humor to his demonic role.\n\nThere are some major differences between the comic book Hellblazer and the movie, like John Constantine was supposed to be British and resemble a rocker named Sting. But I&amp;#039;ve never read the comics, so I can&amp;#039;t complain about these contradictions. But it seems to have the Hellblazer fans disappointed.\n\nI do feel I should advise that this movie has nothing to do with Satanism. And to my knowledge, it was religiously correct. Save the part about demons and angels living on earth.\n\nIn the end, like I said before, you either love it or hate it. Simple as that.\n\nmy rating : 9/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ceb39e89e4c8a1af3bb5e1dfa382908e5d2ea3c","amp;dn":"CONSTANTINE+%5BDVDRip%5D%5B2005%5D%5BXvid%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ceb39e89e4c8a1af3bb5e1dfa382908e5d2ea3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,235,57,232,158,76,138,26,243,187,94,29,250,56,41,8,229,210,234,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
