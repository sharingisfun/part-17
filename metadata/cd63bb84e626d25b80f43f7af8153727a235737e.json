Our flippers are under the gun to buy low, work fast and sell high. But they have one major hurdle to overcome, when they buy a house at auction, they have to move it off the property that day, a task that can be downright dangerous. Once the house is moved to their lot, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a race against time to get it renovated and ready for auction. Who will turn the biggest profit? Who will gamble it all and lose big? Who will destroy their house mid-move? And who will get their chops busted by their annoying rivals?\n\n\n\n\nTexas Flip N' Move - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\nOld Houses Get Moved Out as Three Families Compete to Truck Them Away and Flip them for Profit.\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 20-Dec-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd63bb84e626d25b80f43f7af8153727a235737e","amp;dn":"Texas+Flip+and+Move+S01E01+WEB-DL+x264-Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd63bb84e626d25b80f43f7af8153727a235737e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,99,187,132,230,38,210,91,128,244,63,122,248,21,55,39,162,53,115,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
