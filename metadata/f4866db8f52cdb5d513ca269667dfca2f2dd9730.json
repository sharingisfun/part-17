Reinette lives in the countryside, Mirabelle in Paris. They meet during a holiday of Mirabelle in the country, when Reinette helps her to repair the tube of her bicycle and shows her the beauties of nature and in particular the &amp;#039;blue hour&amp;#039;. They like each other and decide to take a flat together in Paris, where they&amp;#039;ll attend at the University. But isn&amp;#039;t so easy to live together when the characters are so different: as Reinette is simple and enthusiastic, as Mirabelle is obscure and lazy.\n\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090565/\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
