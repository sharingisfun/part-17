Probably one of the better documentaries, mostly seems pro-cannabis and by far the most pro-cannabis documentary thus far released by the History Channel.\n\nThe documentary attempts to educate everyone who still has a Reefer Madness mindset, who still thinks cannabis prohibition is reasonable, and who have no idea that widespread cannabis use is relatively harmless compared to alcohol, tobacco, and especially pharmaceutical and other drugs.\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2638b00481b4c2d0f6b092b4f0b12e5ff76b88e3","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+Marijuana+-+A+Chronic+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2638b00481b4c2d0f6b092b4f0b12e5ff76b88e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,56,176,4,129,180,194,208,246,176,146,180,240,177,46,95,247,107,136,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
