The convoluted plot is concluded by an embrace where &quot;he&quot; is revealed as Princess Hamlet.\n\nThe thing is based on the theories of Edward Vining (qv). The concept is interesting, but the overacting is bad even by silent movie standards.\n\nAsta Nielsen was so interested in this that she formed her own production company to do it. She and her husband Urban Gad are largely responsible for introducing feature films to Germany - Denmark was making them much earlier. The Abyss (1910) is her best-remembered work, mostly on account of its cowboy dance. She soon became part of the German film industry, so many people think of her as a German actress. Did you know she did an earlier 1922 version of Pandora's Box (1929) - apparently now lost.\n\nThis is in .mov form, it should be playable on most players.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d8c19f3e4caa0b60c330113b5b2e3dff1b3fbbd","amp;dn":"Hamlet+%281921%29+Asta+Nielsen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d8c19f3e4caa0b60c330113b5b2e3dff1b3fbbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,140,25,243,228,202,160,182,12,51,1,19,181,178,227,223,241,179,251,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
