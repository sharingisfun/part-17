In the midst of celebration, a stranger appears, warning of new evil that will ensnare your peaceful town. He speaks of ancient secrets locked within a temple, and of gateways to mysterious, yet Undiscovered Realms. Typhon, an outpost built around cold, snowy dungeons, and Druantia, a land of lush forests and endless beauty. Of the temple's secrets, he divulges only the greatest: hidden within is an ancient tome - the Book of Fate, which maintains the balance between all realms. The townsfolk look to you, their new champion, to take up this perilous quest and guide the stranger through the dungeon in search of the ancient temple. You will encounter new dungeons, pet transformations, weapons, monsters, and five completely new quests to test your mettle. New features include Hardcore mode (cheats disabled, more difficult monsters) and a level cap of 199 - import characters from the original FATE and continue your quest. It is time, once again, to determine your FATE!\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nTo customize your resolution, open config.dat (located in %ProgramData%WildTangentfateundiscoveredrealmsPersistent ) in a text editor and edit SCREENWIDTH:800 SCREENHEIGHT:600 to equal your monitor's supported resolution. Don't worry, as Fate can run on almost any custom resolution. (Got a 1920x1080 screen?
