The limelight has been shared by existentialism, phenomenology, structuralism, and other movements. The question remains: what is the next great step in philosophy?\n\nThe World of Philosophy series is a dramatic presentation, in understandable language, of the concerns, questions, interests, and overall outlook of the world's great philosophers and philosophical traditions. Special emphasis on clear and relevant explanations gives you a new arsenal of insights toward living a better life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1202f4765c0bccfe8dd1d6da3853c92b69f135af","amp;dn":"20th+Century+European+Philosophy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1202f4765c0bccfe8dd1d6da3853c92b69f135af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,2,244,118,92,11,204,254,141,209,214,218,56,83,201,43,105,241,53,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
