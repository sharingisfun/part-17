But like many simple questions, this one leads readers on a far-flung quest for a final answer, a search that encompasses such fascinating phenomena as light and electricity and their components--strange but real bits of matter that challenge our assumptions about the very nature of time and space. 40 illustrations.\nIt takes our best science writers, plus readers current with the whimsical new language of particle physics, to keep up with the leapfrog pace of theory and observation today. Fortunately, Asimov does his part in this report on recent theoretical physics developments that includes just enough history to add human dimension to the latest discussions of the nature of matter. Missing here are the characteristic Asimov metaphors and asides, suggesting that, while juggling so many pure concepts at once, he chooses not to distract his readers. No matter, they will welcome this straightforward guide to the Alice-like world of down-quarks, muons, leptons and other subatomic particles--most of which are believed to exist but have not yet been seen. When information does start coming in from the supercollider, this will be a worthy book to have at hand.\n\nThis book was with me originally in DJVU format. I have converted it to PDF with OCR &amp; bookmarks. Both versions are included in the torrent.\n\nCONTENTS\nCHAPTER ONE - MATTER\nDividing Matter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1\nElements ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 6\nAtomism Triumphant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 8\nThe Reality of Atoms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 13\nThe Differences Among Atoms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 18\nCHAPTER TWO - LIGHT\nParticles and Waves 26\nThe Four Phenomena 35\nContents\nCombining the Phenomena ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 42\nExtending the Spectrum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 47\nDividing Energy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 52\nCHAPTER THREE - ELECTRONS\nDividing Electricity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 58\nCathode-Ray Particles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 66\nX Rays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 69\nElectrons and Atoms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 72\nElectrons and Quanta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 79\nWaves and Particles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 82\nCHAPTER FOUR - NUCLEI\nProbing the Atom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 89\nPositively Charged Particles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 96\nAtomic Numbers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 100\nSpectral Lines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 109\nCHAPTER FIVE - ISOTOPES\nNuclear Energy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 122\nNuclear Varieties ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 125\nHalf-Lives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 131\nContents\nStable Nuclear Varieties ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 136\nCHAPTER SIX - NEUTRONS\nProtons and Electrons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 146\nProtons and Neutrons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 151\nNuclear Reactions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 158\nArtificial Isotopes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 164\nCHAPTER SEVEN - BREAKDOWNS\nMass Defect ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 174\nNuclear Fission ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 180\nNuclear Fusion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 187\nBreakdown Particles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 194\nCHAPTER EIGHT - ANTIMATTER\nAntiparticles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 202\nCosmic Rays ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 206\nParticle Accelerators ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 215\nBaryons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 219\nCHAPTER NINE - NEUTRINOS\nContents\nSaving the Laws of Conservation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 225\nDetecting the Antineutrino ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 232\nDetecting the Neutrino ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 235\nOther Leptons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 239\nUnstable Particles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 244\nNeutrino Varieties ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 247\nCHAPTER TEN - INTERACTIONS\nThe Strong Interaction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 253\nThe Weak Interaction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 261\nThe Electroweak Interaction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 266\nCHAPTER ELEVEN - QUARKS\nThe Hadron Zoo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 271\nInside Hadrons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 278\nQuantum Chromodynamics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 284\nCHAPTER TWELVE - THE UNIVERSE\nThe Mystery of the Missing Mass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 291\nThe End of the Universe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 298\nThe Beginning of the Universe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 304\nINDEX ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 311\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c8e3806afdf2659b0f8d014e43a6f1bfe7fc04d","amp;dn":"Atom+-+Journey+across+the+Subatomic+Cosmos+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c8e3806afdf2659b0f8d014e43a6f1bfe7fc04d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,142,56,6,175,223,38,89,176,248,208,20,228,58,111,27,254,127,192,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
