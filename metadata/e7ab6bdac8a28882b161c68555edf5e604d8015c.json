The standard version of the album has truly taken KREATOR to new heights, and this special release will cater to both the old and new fans that the band has made during their two sold-out headlining tours in America. Featuring tons of DVD extras of the entire album with brand new visuals, this is an amazing piece for the fans. Take it from the mouth of frontman Mille Petrozza himself: &quot;Enemy Of God is our best-produced album to date, and the sound is clearly even more brutal in the Dolby surround version.&quot; Amazing stuff from an amazing band!\n\nTracklist:\n\nLive Wacken 2005\n\n01.
