She works hard as a cocktail waitress and helps out at the bed-and-breakfast that Dawg bought for her mother. If she keeps herself busy enough, maybe sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to stay away from the man she promised Dawg she wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t date, the man who has awakened her most ravenous fantasiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brogan Campbell, a biker rumored to be a traitor and a thief. But heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just playing a part; he came to Kentucky for a DHS mission that no one, except Cranston, is supposed to know about. Eve is the key to the whole operation, and his orders are to get her participation. But his need for Eve has nothing to do with stolen secrets and the safety of the countryÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nWhen Dawg took in Eve and her sisters, he warned them that if they ever lied, cheated, or betrayed the family, they risked losing everything. But desire and danger are locked in an inescapable embrace, and Eve has to make her choice between family or Brogan, for better or worseÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                              Published -  November 6th 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d0d9ed7503dcb391ca5dc37be51628ff979fd9","amp;dn":"Nauti+Temptress+by+Lora+Leigh+%28Nauti+Girls+01%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d0d9ed7503dcb391ca5dc37be51628ff979fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,208,217,237,117,3,220,179,145,202,93,195,123,229,22,40,255,151,159,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
