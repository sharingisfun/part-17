Swedish singer-songwriter Kristian Matsson, who is of average size at best Ã¢â‚¬â€ skip directly to &quot;Wind and Walls,&quot; which pops up roughly two-thirds of the way through There's No Leaving Now. Lest you think you've got Matsson's formula locked down (guy + guitar = guy + guitar), the song bobs and sways with undeniable rhythm, propelled by subtly dazzling finger-picking and vocals that project his insights to the rafters without losing their nuance. That's Matsson's formula: His music, constructed from the simplest and boldest of ingredients, maintains a capacity for bounciness, poignancy, propulsion and grace.\n\nThe Tallest Man on Earth's third full-length album, There's No Leaving Now, does tweak Matsson's sound every now and then Ã¢â‚¬â€ the piano that replaces his guitar in the title track provides the quietest jolt you'll hear today Ã¢â‚¬â€ yet sticks largely to it-ain't-broke mode. These 10 songs, like those before them, dazzle and shimmy and sulk, as Matsson continues to conjure images of a young Dylan projecting his voice through a megaphone. If the album seems more like a skillful remake than a sequel, that's okay: Out June 12, There's No Leaving Now remakes Matsson's sound subtly, but in highlight-strewn style.\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/06/the-tallest-man-on-earth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/06/the-tallest-man-on-earth/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bbd35281921cb6b9064036cd4d9defc78683cb5","amp;dn":"The+Tallest+Man+On+Earth...There%27s+No+Leaving+Now%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bbd35281921cb6b9064036cd4d9defc78683cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,189,53,40,25,33,203,107,144,100,3,108,212,217,222,252,120,104,60,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
