Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way. \nThen, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him. \n\nColton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go. \n\n\nNell Hawthorne is in love with her lifelong best friend, Kyle Calloway. Their young love is invincible and life is full of promise; then one night Kyle dies suddenly in a tragic accident and Nell is forever changed. She meets Kyle's older brother Colton for the first time at the funeral. They both struggle to move on with life as best they can. Years later, they meet again in New York City, and Colton realizes that Nell has never really gotten over Kyle's death. She seems to be harboring a deeply rooted pain, a heavy weight of guilt and regret. He knows he shouldn't get involved, but he can't help himself. Trust doesn't come easily for either of them, and they both have demons. Together, they learn the purpose of pain and the meaning of healing, and the importance of forgiveness. \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f68945a3495c3cb93f915175ab445c16925bb094","amp;dn":"Falling+Into+You+by+Jasinda+Wilder+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f68945a3495c3cb93f915175ab445c16925bb094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,137,69,163,73,92,60,185,63,145,81,117,171,68,92,22,146,91,176,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
