I have uploaded these to bittorrent because Creative in their infinite wisdom feel it is acceptable to lie, cheat, and effectively steal from customers. As soon as the &amp;#039;omg, its our intillectual property&amp;#039; crap started being spouted by Creatives forum moderators, I felt bittorrent was the best place for these. You can also download them currently from filefront, but given Creatives stance on this, that may not be true for very long.\n\nIf you are the owner of an Audigy series (excluding Live!), and use Windows Vista, then you will appreciate these drivers as they include alot of the functionality lost through Creatives greed in trying to get people to upgrade to the XFI range rather than just releasing working drivers with working software for the Audigy/Audigy2.\n\nThe driver cd iso can also be used with Windows XP and includes some nice changes over the standard driver cd you would have got when you bought your Audigy. See the respective text for each for a full list of features.\n\nThanks to daniel_k for proving Creative are cunts :)\n\nPlease leave seeding for as long as you can.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e1631215b72c946610721723e5b5cf04eaa505e","amp;dn":"Creative.Soundblaster.Audigy.Series.Vista.Drivers%5Bby.daniel_k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e1631215b72c946610721723e5b5cf04eaa505e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,22,49,33,91,114,201,70,97,7,33,114,62,91,92,240,78,170,80,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
