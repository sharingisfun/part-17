Gates&amp;#039;s company has changed the world, but he&amp;#039;s a controversial figure, with his ruthless business leadership contributing to Microsoft being sued by the US government.\n\nIn a special one-hour edition of the Money Programme, Fiona Bruce presents the definitive profile of Bill Gates as he embarks on his latest challenge: giving away the billions he&amp;#039;s amassed. She examines the fortunes of Microsoft as it faces up to competition from internet-based companies, and the programme asks an array of well-known friends, colleagues and rivals what the future holds for the company in a post-Gates world.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n===File Information===\nFile Name: Bill Gates - How a Geek Changed the World.avi\nDuration: 59:07.880\nFile Size: 488,525,824\n===Video Information===\nVideo Codec: XviD 1.0.1\nVideo Bitrate: 954\nframe Width: 640\nframe Height: 352\nframes Per Second: 25.000\n===Audio Information===\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 134","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9e88305844afb14e46c57921462b15fb16f4730","amp;dn":"Bill+Gates%3A+How+a+Geek+Changed+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9e88305844afb14e46c57921462b15fb16f4730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,232,131,5,132,74,251,20,228,108,87,146,20,98,177,95,177,111,71,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
