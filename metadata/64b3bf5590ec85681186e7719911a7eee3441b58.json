His writing built on the pithy style of his predecessors by adding psychological depth and insights into the motivations of his characters. Macdonald's plots were complicated, and often turned on Archer's unearthing family secrets of his clients and of the criminals who victimized them. Lost or wayward sons and daughters were a theme common to many of the novels. Macdonald deftly combined the two sides of the mystery genre, the &quot;whodunit&quot; and the psychological thriller.\n\nby Ross Macdonald:\n\nArcher in Jeopardy: The Doomsters, The Zebra-Striped Hearse, The Instant Enemy\nBarbarous Coast, The\nBlack Money\nBlue City\nBlue Hammer\nChill, The\nDark Tunnel, The\nDoomsters, The\nDrowning Pool, The\nFar Side of the Dollar, The\nFerguson Affair, The\nFind a Victim\nGalton Case, The\nGoodbye Look, The\nInstant Enemy, The\nIvory Grin, The\nMeet Me at the Morgue\nMoving Target, The\nName Is Archer, The\nSleeping Beauty\nUnderground Man, The\nWay Some People Die, The\nWycherly Woman, The\nZebra-Striped Hearse, The\n\nby Robert Gale:\n\nA Ross Macdonald Companion (pdf)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b3bf5590ec85681186e7719911a7eee3441b58","amp;dn":"Ross+Macdonald+-+classic+mysteries+-+25+books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b3bf5590ec85681186e7719911a7eee3441b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,179,191,85,144,236,133,104,17,134,231,113,153,17,167,238,227,68,27,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
