Klein, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIndustrial Color PhysicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nSpringer | 2010 | ISBN: 1441911960 | 470 pages | PDF \n\nThis unique book starts with a short historical overview of the development of the theories and applications of industrial color physics. The three dominant factors producing color - light source, color sample, and observer - are described in detail. The standardized color spaces are shown and related color values are applied to characteristic color qualities of absorption as well as of effect colorants. The fundamentals of spectrometric and colorimetric measuring techniques together with specific applications are described. Theoretical models for radiative transfer in transparent, translucent, and opaque layers are detailed; the two, three, and multi-flux approximations are presented for the first time in a coherent formalism. These methods constitute the fundamentals not only for the important classical methods, but also modern methods of recipe prediction applicable to all known colorants.\n\nThe work describes in detail the fundamentals as well as the latest developments in research, in particular to be able to work extensively in the far-reaching fields of industrial color physics.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7f61366c3732da5a0f445b5ab04304dc41d89f","amp;dn":"Industrial+Color+Physics+%282010%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7f61366c3732da5a0f445b5ab04304dc41d89f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,127,97,54,108,55,50,218,90,15,68,91,90,176,67,4,220,65,216,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
