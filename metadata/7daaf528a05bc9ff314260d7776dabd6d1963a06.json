Mary's father runs a sleep disorder clinic where Mary enters the ghastly dreams of severely disturbed people in an attempt to help them. When a patient is revealed to be a serial killer, the nightmare world and the waking one become intertwined, putting Mary in real jeopardy. Set in a world where the boundaries between dreams and reality are tenuous, Night Mary is a very dark and terrifying trip into psychological horror.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7daaf528a05bc9ff314260d7776dabd6d1963a06","amp;dn":"Night+Mary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7daaf528a05bc9ff314260d7776dabd6d1963a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,170,245,40,160,91,201,255,49,66,96,215,119,109,171,214,209,150,58,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
