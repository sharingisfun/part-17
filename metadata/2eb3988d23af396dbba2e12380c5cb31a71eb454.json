Even though separated by time, space and cultural forms, they were linked together by a common wisdom, a nexus which spans time and space to form a lineage of oral and written teaching which continue to this day. In the earliest stages of manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s present cycle we find records of this tradition in images drawn on cave walls, strange statues, enigmatic diagrams and glyphs too distant to mean much to us now. It is really only in Egypt that we start to find the first records of a fully developed esoteric system, one which I may add, still seems unique in its beauty and complexity.\n\nThe school of Egypt in some sense forms the first link in a chain which spans history, it can be linked to the early esoteric traditions of the Aryans, the Tantric schools of Tartary, the fire priests of Zoroaster and the Mystery Cults of Israel. These form some of the earliest nuclei from which later esoteric traditions evolved and developed. In these forms we find some of the most complete occult systems taught and practised throughout the Millennia. Since their demise the Gnosis has continued, albeit in a different form. While these earlier civilisations offered racial and national centres of the Mysteries, the traditions that followed were, for the most part, carried by secret and clandestine bodies. Popularity when it did arrive, did not last for long and soon again they made a hasty retreat to the shadows. Certainly this was true with the Essene Gnosis as taught by Master Jesus, it was only a very short time after his transfiguration before the true teachings could only be passed in secret, and distorted and twisted forms were offered in their stead by the military-political complex that had become the Church.\n\nTaken as a whole the Mystery teachings form what can be best understood as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVoice of the GnosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it is from this voice that ultimately all authentic esoteric teachings come. We have deliberately used the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVoiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as it represents a living force. Far more than just an academic exercise, the Gnosis is alive, it is a life transforming vortex, it is the voice originating from a world from which mankind is utterly alienated.\n\nThe teachings offered in these books may, at first glance, seem to have much in common with materials you could receive from other occult, esoteric or spiritual organisation, but there also much that is at variance. The unique thing about the Gnostic tradition is that it really comprehends the condition of modern man and his alienation from the energies which are the source of all illumination. While other traditions may have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œknowledgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to offer, until they come to terms with the nature of the Cosmic battle - the Dualism which is at the centre of modern life, they cannot hope to offer real initiation or real spiritual transformation. It is not enough to have the right techniques or the latest rituals or tools, unless you know why they work and what they need to be used for. Without insight, ritualism is of little or no value.\nFor until we know how to go beyond the things of the lower world there can be no real wisdom or development. Even if we become masters of matter, unless we have the power to escape its grip, death still arrives inevitably to the master or student.\n\nThe form we have used in outlining the Gnosis is to offer the original Mystery teachings coupled with research and validation from modern sources. We believe that it is of great value to see the way in which philosophical, scientific and psychological research has validated much of what has been known for centuries within the Gnostic schools. But this, of course, has it limits. While modern psychology and science may agree with us that there are altered states of being, even perhaps other dimensions, it is only the Gnostic who realises that through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcorrespondenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the altered state can be used as a gateway to explore the world outside. Certainly it is also only the Gnostic who undertakes the adventure to get there.\n\nBy using the master keys provided in the Gnostic and esoteric traditions and correlating these with modern research, The Institute for Gnostic Studies can offer you techniques and theories which will change the way you experience yourself and the world forever. And this, by the way, is the aim of the Gnosis, the transformation of lead into gold, man into God, the transfiguration of the student from a seeker of the Mysteries to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa partaker of the GnosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. In the past such experiences have remained largely unexplored, they have been dimensions only dreamed of by madman, experienced by mystics, mastered by magicians and embodied by Avatars. However, today, as the Omega Day fast approaches, we offer the challenge of uncharted dimensions and new worlds, which can not only be explored, but used to develop undreamed of levels of post-human potential.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n\n\n1.
