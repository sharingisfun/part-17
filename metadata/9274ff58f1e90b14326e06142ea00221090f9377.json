Main features of the Grammar include:\n\nclear explanations\n\nemphasis on areas of particular difficulty for learners of Russian, such as numerals and verbs of motion\n\nextensive cross-referencing between the different sections.\n\nThis is the ideal reference grammar for learners of Russian at all levels, from beginner to advanced.
