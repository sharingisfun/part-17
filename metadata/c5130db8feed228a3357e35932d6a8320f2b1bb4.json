These beings were referred to as &quot;Ultra Sapiens&quot;. However, there was a breakout, and most of the Ultra Sapiens went underground, hiding their gifts. Some went back to work for the government, tracking their rogue brethren and dealing with &quot;situations.\n\nHowever, something else was also created by the project, capable of tracking and neutralising any Ultra Sapiens, anywhere. No one knows what it is, what it looks like, or where it is.\n\nWritten by Mark Waid and penciled by Marc Silvestri.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5130db8feed228a3357e35932d6a8320f2b1bb4","amp;dn":"Hunter-Killer+%28Top+Cow%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5130db8feed228a3357e35932d6a8320f2b1bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,19,13,184,254,237,34,138,51,87,227,89,50,214,168,50,15,43,27,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
