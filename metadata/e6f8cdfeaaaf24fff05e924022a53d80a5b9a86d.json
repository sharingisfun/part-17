The band's manager was Kim Clarke Champniss, later to become a MuchMusic VJ.\n\nThe band released four EPs before their full-length debut, 1985's In the House. Their first notable chart hit was &quot;Lust for Love&quot;, from the 1983 self-titled EP. Gordon left the band in 1984, and was replaced by Ed Shaw.\n\nTheir song &quot;In the House&quot; won the 1986 CASBY Award for Single of the Year, with the band named Group of the Year.\n\nCrompton left Images in Vogue in 1986, indicating that the band was too commercial for his tastes, and concentrated on his side project Skinny Puppy. \n\nA1   Promised Land    \n     \nA2   Call It Love    \n     \nA3   Rescue Me    \n     \nA4   King's Service    \n     \nA5   Awaken Me    \n     \nB1   Holiday    \n     \nB2   Save It    \n     \nB3   Talking To Myself    \n     \nB4   One Way Heart    \n     \nB5   In The House    \n     \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f8cdfeaaaf24fff05e924022a53d80a5b9a86d","amp;dn":"Images+In+Vogue+-+In+The+House+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f8cdfeaaaf24fff05e924022a53d80a5b9a86d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,248,205,254,170,175,36,255,240,94,146,64,34,165,61,128,165,185,168,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
