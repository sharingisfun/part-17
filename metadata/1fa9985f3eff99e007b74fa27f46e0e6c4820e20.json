Tipperary, who travels to America in the late 1880s to become a cowboy, leaving behind his first love - the rose of Roscrae.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic opening features the lone haunting voice of Texan Jimmie Dale Gilmore soon giving way to the distinctive deep tones of Russell describing the young manâ€™s departure from Templemore.\r\n\r\nTrack five, the albumâ€™s title track is a great stand-alone song with whistle running through it and the hook line &quot;as I walked all night from Roscrae to Templemore&quot;. Itâ€™s one of those tracks you just have to play again.\r\n\r\nThe first disc has 27 tracks although some are very short but important links for stories.\r\n\r\nApart from the aforementioned, there are some truly memorable tracks such as Jimmy Le Fave singing Ainâ€™t No More Cane On The Brazos and Tomâ€™s brilliant The Last Running - a great story wonderfully told. \r\nFinbar Furey also appears as a guest singing Carrickfergus. \r\n\r\nThe other Irish guest singer Maura Oâ€™Connell, performs The Water is Wide which then slips gently into The Red River Valley instrumental by The Norwegian Wind Ensemble.\r\n\r\nMaura follows that with I Talk to God, another powerful track. \r\nAlong with Maura this second album features more female singers such as Eliza Gilkyson, Gretchen Peters and Bonnie Dobson. \r\nRussell kicks up a storm with the driving country rock Hard Time in Texas while Whiskey in his Blood evokes memories of the great Waylon Jennings sound.\r\n\r\nThe album closes with The Rose of Roscrea again, but this time by Maura Oâ€™Connell. \r\nThis was an inspired move as her magnificent voice puts the finishing touches to a remarkable work that will be hard to beat as my album of the year.\r\n\r\nTom Russell has done it again. \r\n\r\n\r\nMultiTracker @ FrankFoo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa9985f3eff99e007b74fa27f46e0e6c4820e20","amp;dn":"Tom+Russell+-+The+Rose+Of+Roscrae+%28MP3%40320%29+%5BFrankFoo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa9985f3eff99e007b74fa27f46e0e6c4820e20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,169,152,95,62,255,153,224,7,183,79,162,127,70,224,230,196,130,14,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
