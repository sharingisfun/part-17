This UNDUB has\n  the USA english text with the original Japanese spoken dialog. \n  \n  Enjoy this game the way it was meant to be played!\n  \n                    -- Release Notes --\n  \n  Finally I overcame apathy long enough to finish this project. \n  The complicated stuff I coded some time ago but boredom with the\n  game was discouraging me from resolving a few problems.\n\n  One issue was that the sound data did not match up perfectly so\n  I ended up manually straightening out voices that were missing,\n  extra, out of order, etc... \n\n  If anything is still broken, too bad; I&amp;#039;m tired of looking at it.\n  \n  Event, battle and movie voices are now Japanese.  Remember to\n  enable subtitles in the config.  The narrator and a small number\n  of other conversations lacked voices in the JP version so have\n  been silenced.\n  \n  Now that one backburner project is out of the way it would be\n  nice to finish Valkyrie Profile 2 as well.  It&amp;#039;s all taken care\n  of except for some of the battle voices ... sigh.\n  \n  Anybody able to dump registers/memory from games on real PS2\n  hardware?  Please find me. :)\n  \n  Hackers/coders want to contact me?  Look for a fluffy kitty.\n  \n                   *** USA PUBLISHERS ***\n  \n  Please stop ruining your games with such horrible english dubs!\n  We are forced to go to extremes like this because you are making\n  the games we love unplayable!\n  \n  Consider multi-language or special-edition releases with the\n  original high quality Japanese voices.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5ad590387f06e95caa10c5417c65d170840a650","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+XII+USA+UNDUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5ad590387f06e95caa10c5417c65d170840a650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,173,89,3,135,240,110,149,202,161,12,84,23,198,93,23,8,64,166,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
