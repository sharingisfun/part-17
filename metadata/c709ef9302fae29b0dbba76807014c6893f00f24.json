This is the second book in the series.\n\nIf you do not know Milo Manara, shame on you. He is one of the worlds most renowned artist of erotic comics, and everyone should really be able to recognize his style from just looking at a page, his drawings of women are amazing.\n\nThis version is the new french colour edition, with an amazing new colour scheme, so I of course had to scanlate it, to bring you this gorgeous comic in english.\n\nClick is about a young pretty housewive, Claudia Christiani, who is frigid to the point of being chronically averse to the mere mention of sex. A family friend steals a device, that can turn her sex drive on at will, and star to use this to humiliate her for rejecting him.\n\nThis book contains a lot of sexual acts, but Manara's art is more of a soft core style, so you will not see anything you can't spot watching the average HBO series like Spartacus or True Blood :) But just remember to not hand this book to your kids :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c709ef9302fae29b0dbba76807014c6893f00f24","amp;dn":"Click+-+Book+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c709ef9302fae29b0dbba76807014c6893f00f24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,9,239,147,2,250,226,155,13,187,167,104,7,1,76,104,147,240,15,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
