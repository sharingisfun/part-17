What was he like? \n\nFor more than 2,000 years, people and groups of varying convictions have pondered these questions and done their best to answer them. \n\nThe significance of the subject is apparent. \n\nFrom the late Roman Empire all the way to our own time, no continuously existing institution or belief system has wielded as much influence as Christianity, no figure as much as Jesus. \n\nWorshiped around the globe by more than a billion people today, he is undoubtedly the single most important figure in the story of Western civilization and one of the most significant in world history altogether. \n\nA Wide Range of Opinion, Even among Scholars\n\nEveryone who has even the faintest knowledge of Jesus has an opinion about him, says Professor Bart D. Ehrman, and these opinions vary widely. \n\nThose differences are visible not only among laypeople but even among professional scholars who have devoted their lives to the task of reconstructing what the historical Jesus was probably like and what he most likely said and did. \n\nYou learn what the best historical evidence seems to indicate as you listen to lectures developed with no intention of affirming or denying any particular theological beliefs. \n\nProfessor Bart D. EhrmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who created this course as a companion to his 24-lecture Teaching Company course on The New TestamentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½approaches the question from a purely historical perspective. \n\nHe explains why it has proven so difficult to know about this &quot;Jesus of history.&quot; And he reveals the kinds of conclusions modern scholars have drawn about him. \n\nThe Principal Sources of Knowledge about Jesus \n\nYou open the course with a discussion of the four New Testament Gospels, which everyone agrees are our principal sources of knowledge about Jesus. \n\nYou learn that these books are not written as dispassionate histories for impartial observers and that their authors do not claim to have been eyewitnesses to the events they narrate. \n\nInstead, they are writing several decades later, telling stories that they have heardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½stories that have been in circulation for decades among the followers of Jesus. \n\nThe first step, then, is to determine what kinds of books the Gospels are and to ascertain how reliable their information about Jesus is. \n\nThe question will be: Apart from their value as religious documents of faith, what do the Gospels tell historians? \n\nThe Challenges Scholars Face \n\nAs you soon learn, the Gospels pose considerable challenges to scholars who want to know about the words and deeds of Jesus. \n\nYou begin exploring some of these difficulties by asking what sorts of documents the Gospels are:\nWho wrote them, and why? \nHow do they present themselves? \nWho was their intended audience? \nWhat is their relationship to each other, to the rest of the New Testament, and to other early Christian writings? \nWhat is their status as historical narratives? \n\nTo help answer these questions, you join Professor Ehrman in a careful consideration of other relevant sources. \n\nThese include the many writingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½some unearthed only recentlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that did not make it into the New Testament, but which nonetheless claim to relate the life and teachings of Jesus. \n\nLearn about the &quot;Lost Gospel of Q&quot; \n\nAmong these is the much-discussed &quot;lost Gospel of Q.&quot; You learn why scholars believe such a text existed and what they think might be in it. \n\nYou address how much documentary evidence about Jesus can be found in ancient Jewish and Roman sources, what those references tell us, and even how historians approach such sources to begin with once they have them in hand. \n\nProfessor Ehrman addresses questions including: \nWhat are the criteria scholars use to sift and compare those sources? \nHow do they actually dig &quot;behind&quot; the surface of stories about Jesus to ascertain what he himself was most probably like? \nWhat is the reasoning that supports each of these methods of testing evidence? \n\nOnce you've absorbed this introduction to the sources and the ways in which they are handled, Professor Ehrman moves ahead to consider the historical context of Jesus' life. \n\nThe assumption here is that historical understanding, to whatever extent possible, must begin by seeking to situate Jesus in the context of his own times. \n\nReconstructing Jesus' Life and Deeds \n\nAfter surveying the political, social, and cultural history of 1st-century Palestine, you proceed to the second major part of the course, a scholarly reconstruction of Jesus' words and deeds in light of the best available historical methods and evidence. \n\nIn reconstructing those words and deeds, Professor Ehrman addresses several questions: \nWhy do the earliest sources at our disposal, including the Gospel of Mark, portray Jesus as a Jewish apocalypticist who anticipated that God was soon going to overthrow the forces of evil and establish his good Kingdom here on Earth? \nHow close is this portrayal to life? \nDid Jesus proclaim a coming Kingdom? \nHow are his references to the coming of the &quot;Son of Man&quot; to be understood in light of the best historical analysis and evidence we can muster? \n\nA Fateful Passover \nHow do Jesus' ethical teachings, his own activities, and the events of his final days fit into this analysis? \nWhy did Jesus go to Jerusalem at Passover and what did he plan to do once he got there? \nWhat was the situation he found? \nWhat were the intentions of those he met there, including the Roman procurator Pontius Pilate, the Temple hierarchy, and the other Jewish authorities? \n\nHistorical scholarship has something to teach about all of these questions, and the answers will help to further your understanding of the Jesus of history. \n\nProfessor Ehrman closes by considering how Jesus' followers began to speak and eventually write about him in light of their belief that God had raised him from the dead. \n\nHere the focus shifts from the religion of Jesus to the religion aboutJesus, or in other words, from the search for the historical Jesus to the study of early Christianity. \n\nThat is a natural place at which to conclude this course, which forms an excellent accompaniment to Professor Ehrman's two-part lecture series on The New Testament and other Teaching Company courses on religion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0f5482354f56013ec1de750fc773689d9fa7ea","amp;dn":"TTC+Video+-+Historical+Jesus+-+Bart+D.+Ehrman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0f5482354f56013ec1de750fc773689d9fa7ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,15,84,130,53,79,86,1,62,193,222,117,15,199,115,104,157,159,167,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
