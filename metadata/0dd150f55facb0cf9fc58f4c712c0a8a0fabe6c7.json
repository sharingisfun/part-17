It was released on 8 April 2016, by London Records, which relaunched especially for the project. It serves as the group's comeback album, their first in nearly a decade, following the release of 2006's Studio 1, which resulted in them being dropped by Parlophone. A string of live performances and touring with the Backstreet Boys in 2014 sparked interest within the group to reform and record Red Flag. All Saints collaborated with producers K-Gee, Hutch, The Invisible Men and Utters for the album.\r\n\r\nThe album was preceded by the release of &quot;One Strike&quot; as its lead single on 23 February 2016. To promote Red Flag, All Saints played a headlining gig at London's KOKO on 4 April 2016 and will embark on their first headlining tour in 15 years, the Red Flag Tour, in October 2016.\r\n\r\n~[FILE INFORMATION]~\r\nAll Saints - Red Flag (2016)\r\nReleased: April 08, 2016\r\nLabel: London Records\r\nGenre: Pop\r\nEncoder: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\r\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz\r\nDepth: 16-bit\r\n\r\n~[TRACK LIST]~\r\n1.
