Doug and Tony materialize behind British lines and soon find themselves in the custody of Colonel Southall, a man history records as &quot;The Butcher&quot; because of a disastrous mistake attacking the strongest side of Andrew &quot;Old Hickory&quot; Jackson's fortifications. Southall believes the chrononauts can supply tactical information and he'll stop at nothing to get it. Meanwhile, Southall's descendant, a general in the modern British Army, visits the TicToc complex to explain what his ancestor is likely to do. But General Southall, unknown to anyone else, is dying - and so it may well be his actions that are the most unpredictable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e981569336eb20801afec797989c534dc879fb3","amp;dn":"The+Time+Tunnel+-+The+Last+Patrol+Ep.+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e981569336eb20801afec797989c534dc879fb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,152,21,105,51,110,178,8,1,175,236,121,121,137,197,52,220,135,159,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
