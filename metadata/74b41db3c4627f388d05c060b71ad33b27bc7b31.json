It was the third single and their sixth track from their second album, Siamese Dream. &quot;Disarm&quot; was written by Billy Corgan and is one of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most highly regarded songs. Corgan considers it the most personally important song on Siamese Dream.\n\nThe music video, directed by Jake Scott, is black and white and shows the members of the band floating over images of a house, an old man walking through an underpass while home movie-esque, color footage shows a young boy playing outside. Billy Corgan has said that he didn't want the old man in the video, but Scott insisted. The video premiered on MTV in late 1993 and was immediately placed into heavy rotation. In 1994, it was nominated for Best Alternative Video and Best Editing at the MTV Video Music Awards, the Pumpkins' first MTV Awards nominations.\n\nThe BBC banned the song from appearing on Top of the Pops, because of the lyric &quot;cut that little child&quot;, and it received little radio airplay in the United Kingdom. That lyric along with lyrics like &quot;what I choose is my choice&quot; and &quot;the killer in me is the killer in you&quot; has also led to some controversy, as some read it as implying that abortion is murder. Corgan, however, has clearly asserted that the song is about the shaky relationship he had with his parents while growing up. However, even with the ban and the limited radio time, it still peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart. In the U.S., the song failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number five on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number eight on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nWhile the Pumpkins often produced softer, acoustic versions of many of their louder, more aggressive songs, the band performed a heavy, electric version of &quot;Disarm&quot; on a British television appearance, as featured on Vieuphoria, and also on live U.S. TV at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards. The electric version changes the tone of the song from that of a ballad to a more angst-driven rock song.\n\nSiamese Dream is the second studio album by the American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins, released on July 27, 1993 on Virgin Records. The album fused diverse influences such as shoegazing, dream pop, classic heavy metal, and progressive rock.\n\nDespite recording sessions fraught with difficulties and tensions, Siamese Dream debuted at number ten on the Billboard charts, sold over four million copies in the U.S. and over six million worldwide, cementing The Smashing Pumpkins as a major force in the alternative rock movement. Four hit singles were released in support of Siamese Dream, &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Disarm&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74b41db3c4627f388d05c060b71ad33b27bc7b31","amp;dn":"Smashing+Pumpkins+-+Disarm+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74b41db3c4627f388d05c060b71ad33b27bc7b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,180,29,179,196,98,127,56,141,5,192,96,183,26,211,59,39,188,123,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
