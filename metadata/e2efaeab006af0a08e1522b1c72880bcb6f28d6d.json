The Bible claims there will never be another like him. His legacy includes three canonical works that flowed from God to his pen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon.\nStrangely, these three books are rarely examined by modern scholars, but longtime author and defender of the faith, the later Henry Morris, provided and invaluable commentary. His examination of SolomonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life, and the insights into the writings themselves, give the Bible student a worthy tour through the life of a most remarkable man.\n\nAbout the author:\nHenry Morris, Ph.D., (deceased) earned the title, &quot;The Father of Modern Creationism,&quot; through with his numerous writings about the creation/evolution debate. Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled The Genesis Flood in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation.He was the founder of the Institute for Creation Research in California.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2efaeab006af0a08e1522b1c72880bcb6f28d6d","amp;dn":"The+Remarkable+Wisdom+Of+Solomon+-+Dr.+Henry+M.+Morris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2efaeab006af0a08e1522b1c72880bcb6f28d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,239,174,171,0,106,240,160,142,21,34,177,199,40,128,188,182,242,141,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
