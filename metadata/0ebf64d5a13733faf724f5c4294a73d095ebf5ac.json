For me, that\\&amp;#039;s the way it will end. In the meantime, the figures of an intricate game are developing, a game whosede-coding will give historians of the future - if they are still around - a very hard time.\n\nA weird game. Its rules change as the match evolves. To start with, the super powers\\&amp;#039; rivalry transforms itself not only into a Holy Alliance of the Rich against the Poor, but also into a selective co-elimination of Revolutionary Vanguards, wherever bombs would endanger sources of raw materials. As well as into the manipulation of these vanguards to pursue goals that are not their own.\n\nDuring the last ten years, some groups of forces (often more instinctive than organized) have been trying to play the game themselves - even if they knocked over the pieces. Wherever they tried, they failed. Nevertheless, it\\&amp;#039;s been their being that has the most profoundly transformed politics in our time. This film intends to show some of the steps of this transformation.\n\n- Chris Marker\n\n--\n\nSource\tdvdrip\nRip Specs\tdur : 3h @ 25 fps (transcoded from ntsc)\nenc : xvid 2 pass\nres : 608*448\n1557 kb QF 0.229 (pt1) - 1524 kb QF 0.224 (pt2)\nsnd :mp3 vbr mono 79k (pt1) / 83k (pt2) \n\nFrench, English, and Spanish subs included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ebf64d5a13733faf724f5c4294a73d095ebf5ac","amp;dn":"Le+fond+de+l%5C%27air+est+rouge+DVD+Rip+-+subs+include","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ebf64d5a13733faf724f5c4294a73d095ebf5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,191,100,213,161,55,51,250,247,36,245,196,41,74,115,208,149,235,245,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
