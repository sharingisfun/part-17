It looks at debates within neurology and culture through neurological works, popular advice, and the appearance of neurological disorders within the aesthetic artefacts of modernity.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n'This excellent collection opens up a fascinating area of discourse in relation to the modern area, moving the debate away from established thinking on 'nerves' in terms of neurasthenia, shell-shock and neurosis,and investigating a much wider range of issues -- indeed a whole a culture of nervousness - informed by the new understandings of neurology. The essays range across a variety of fascinating topics (speech disorders, peristalsis, vibration-cures, paranoia), exploring the dethroned modern self, wired from within and without to its physical and social environment. For the student of bodily and mental cultures, this will be a vital text.' - Tim Armstrong, Royal Holloway, University of London\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nLAURA SALISBURY is RCUK Fellow in Science, Technology and Culture at the School of English and Humanities, Birkbeck College, University of London, UK.\nANDREW SHAIL is News International Research Fellow in Film at St Annes College, University of Oxford, UK.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808aeabb8e2b200b9b07ef016cefa07f5d2d7ed1","amp;dn":"Laura+Salisbury+-+Neurology+and+Modernity.+A+Cultural+History+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808aeabb8e2b200b9b07ef016cefa07f5d2d7ed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,138,234,187,142,43,32,11,155,7,239,1,108,239,160,127,93,45,126,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
