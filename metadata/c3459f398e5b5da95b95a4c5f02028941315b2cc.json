Any of his books was built around the McLuhan-question: 'Does the form of any medium of communication affect our social relations, our political ideas, or psychic habits, and of course, as he [Marshall McLuhan] always emphasized, our sensorium' (Postman: 07/30/05)? Postman was aware of the fact that a new technology and therefore a new medium may have destructive as well as creative effects. During the history of mankind there have been tremendous changes in the forms, volume, speed and context of information and it is necessary to find out what these changes meant and mean to our cultures (Postman: 1985, 160). For him, it is a basic principle that 'the clearest way to see through a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation' (Postman: 1985, 8).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3459f398e5b5da95b95a4c5f02028941315b2cc","amp;dn":"Neil+Postman+-+Amusing+and+Informing+Ourselves+to+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3459f398e5b5da95b95a4c5f02028941315b2cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,69,159,57,142,91,93,169,91,149,164,197,240,32,40,148,19,21,178,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
