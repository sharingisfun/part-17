October 2009, 12:16 for CD\n\nRod Stewart / Every Picture Tells A Story [MFSL UDCD532]\n\nRod Stewart was at his best between the years 1969 to 1975, when he was cultivating his solo career while still a member of The Faces, and before the tawdry posturing of his &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot; disco years. When he was at his best, Stewart released The Rod Stewart Album in 1969, (featuring &quot;Handbags and Gladrags&quot;); Gasoline Alley in 1970 (featuring the Rod Stewart-Ronnie Wood song &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;); Every Picture Tells a Story in 1971 (featuring the classic singles &quot;Maggie May,&quot; &quot;(I Know) I'm Losing You,&quot; and the Tim Hardin song &quot;Reason To Believe&quot;); and Never a Dull Moment in 1972 (featuring Sam Cooke's &quot;Twisting the Night Away,&quot; &quot;You Wear It Well,&quot; and &quot;Lost Paraguayos&quot;). All of these classic Rod songs define the true artistic genius of Rod Stewart before he sold his soul to disco, prompting Rolling Stone magazine to observe: &quot;Rarely has a singer had as full and unique a talent as Rod Stewart; rarely has anyone betrayed his talent so completely.&quot;\n\nWith all five members of The Faces appearing on the album, Every Picture Tells a Story is the definitive Rod Stewart album. Stewart wrote several hit singles for the album: the coming-of-age classic that launched his solo career, &quot;Maggie May;&quot; &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot; (co-written with Ronnie Wood); and the mandolin-driven &quot;Mandolin Wind.&quot; The other songs on the album stand up well against Stewart's songs, including the hard-edged rocker, &quot;(I Know) I'm Losing You,&quot; and a Dylan cover, &quot;Tomorrow is a Long Time.&quot; Complete album tracks include:\n\n1. Every Picture Tells A Story 5:59\n2. Seems Like A Long Time 4:02\n3. That's All Right 6:00\n4. Tomorrow Is A Long Time 3:48\n5. Maggie May 5:50\n6. Mandolin Wind 5:36\n7. (I Know) I'm Losing You 5:23\n8. (Find A) Reason To Believe 4:10 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6370c81fbd37a1d67b501885ce5231f5d1baae41","amp;dn":"Rod+Stewart+%2F+Every+Picture+Tells+A+Story+%5BMFSL+UDCD532%5DFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6370c81fbd37a1d67b501885ce5231f5d1baae41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,112,200,31,189,55,161,214,123,80,24,133,206,82,49,245,209,186,174,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
