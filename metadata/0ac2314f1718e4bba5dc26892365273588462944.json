These questions dominated the sound bites of the 2012 U.S. presidential election, the fiscal-cliff debates, and the perverse policies of the European Union.\n\nRobert Kuttner makes the most powerful argument to date that these are the wrong questions and that austerity is the wrong answer. Blending economics with historical contrasts of effective debt relief and punitive debt enforcement, he makes clear that universal belt-tightening, as a prescription for recession, defies economic logic. And while the public debt gets most of the attention, it is private debts that crashed the economy and are sandbagging the recoveryÃ¢â‚¬â€mortgages, student loans, consumer borrowing to make up for lagging wages, speculative shortfalls incurred by banks. As Kuttner observes, corporations get to use bankruptcy to walk away from debts. Homeowners and small nations donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Thus, we need more public borrowing and investment to revive a depressed economy, and more forgiveness and reform of the overhang of past debts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac2314f1718e4bba5dc26892365273588462944","amp;dn":"Debtors%27+Prison%3A+The+Politics+of+Austerity+Versus+Possibility","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac2314f1718e4bba5dc26892365273588462944","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,194,49,79,23,24,228,187,165,220,38,137,35,101,39,53,136,70,41,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
