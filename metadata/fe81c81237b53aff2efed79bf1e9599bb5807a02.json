In this fascinating book, Mario Livio tells the tale of a number at the heart of that mystery: phi, or 1.6180339887...This curious mathematical relationship, widely known as &quot;The Golden Ratio,&quot; was discovered by Euclid more than two thousand years ago because of its crucial role in the construction of the pentagram, to which magical properties had been attributed. Since then it has shown a propensity to appear in the most astonishing variety of places, from mollusk shells, sunflower florets, and rose petals to the shape of the galaxy. Psychological studies have investigated whether the Golden Ratio is the most aesthetically pleasing proportion extant, and it has been asserted that the creators of the Pyramids and the Parthenon employed it. It is believed to feature in works of art from Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa to Salvador Dali's The Sacrament of the Last Supper, and poets and composers have used it in their works. It has even been found to be connected to the behavior of the stock market!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe81c81237b53aff2efed79bf1e9599bb5807a02","amp;dn":"The+Golden+Ratio%3A+The+Story+of+PHI%2C+the+World%27s+Most+Astonishing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe81c81237b53aff2efed79bf1e9599bb5807a02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,129,200,18,55,181,58,255,46,254,215,155,241,233,89,155,181,128,122,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
