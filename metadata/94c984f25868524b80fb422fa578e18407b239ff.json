Now it's time for Daryl to tackle the kitchen and he gives every detail his attention. Custom made, period accurate cabinets help give the room a historic look. Daryl sets off for Massachusetts, hoping to hunt down a vintage, refinished iron stove, an antique apothecary table and salvaged boards for the floor to round out the room. However, finding the right stain for the wood paneled walls becomes a challenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c984f25868524b80fb422fa578e18407b239ff","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Daryl%27s.Restoration.Over-Hall.S01E08.720p.X264.SCREEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c984f25868524b80fb422fa578e18407b239ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,201,132,242,88,104,82,75,128,251,66,47,165,120,225,132,7,178,57,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
