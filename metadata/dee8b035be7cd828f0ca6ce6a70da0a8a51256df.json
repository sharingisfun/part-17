Originally known as Hocus Pocus, the group, which took the name UFO in honor of a London club, debuted in 1971 with UFO 1. Both the album and its follow-up, the same year's Flying, found great success in Japan, France, and Germany, but went barely noticed in the band's native country; as a result, their third effort, 1972's Live, was released only in Japan. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.89% CDDA &amp; 99.94% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tMusic Club Deluxe\nCatalog:\t\tMCDLX 140\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nCD 1\n\n01.Doctor Doctor (Live)\n02.Only You Can Rock Me (7&quot; Version)\n03.Let It Roll\n04.Shoot Shoot (Live)\n05.Too Hot To Handle\n06.Young Blood\n07.Lonley Heart\n08.Let It Rain\n09.When Its Time To Rock\n10.Rock Bottom\n11.Oh My\n12.Crystal Light\n13.Love Lost Love\n14.Natural Thing\n15.I'm A Loser\n16.Can You Roll Her\n17.Just Another Suicide\n18.Night Run\n19.Space Child\n\n\nCD 2\n\n01.Hot 'N' Ready\n02.Back Into My Life\n03.Gettin' Ready\n04.Pack It Up (And Go)\n05.Love To Love\n06.Ain't No Baby\n07.Lettin' Go\n08.This Fire Burns Tonight\n09.Gone In The Night\n10.Chains Chains\n11.Long Gone\n12.The Wild, The Willing &amp; The Innocent\n13.It's Killing Me\n14.The Writer\n15.Doing It All For You\n16.This Time\n17.Lookin' Out For No. 1\n18.High Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee8b035be7cd828f0ca6ce6a70da0a8a51256df","amp;dn":"Too+Hot+To+Handle+-+The+Very+Best+Of+UFO+%282012%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee8b035be7cd828f0ca6ce6a70da0a8a51256df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,232,176,53,190,124,216,40,240,202,108,230,167,13,160,168,165,18,86,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
