The voxel-based enemies can be punched, bashed, kicked, stabbed and sliced completely dynamically using almost anything that isn't nailed down.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to use your wits, speed and anything you can get your hands on in epic bar fights, disco brawls, old west saloon rumbles, college frat house beat-downs and a lot more.\r\n\r\nWe'll be adding more levels to the Early Access versions leading up to release and look forward to creating the best level ideas from the community.
