Although he dotes on her, she is soon bored and discontent. First, she gives her imagination to a law student in town, and next she takes a lover. When he refuses to run away with her, she takes up again with the law clerk. Her spending on dresses and furnishings mounts; these debts and her ill-advised professional counsel to her husband bring his ruin.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f45ffa03e0336785f1a5a17707bbcb03fbb5ba","amp;dn":"Madame+Bovary+%28Miniserie+BBC%29+DVD+2%2F2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f45ffa03e0336785f1a5a17707bbcb03fbb5ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,244,95,250,3,224,51,103,133,241,165,161,119,7,187,203,3,251,181,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
