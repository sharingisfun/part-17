FEEDING GROUND reaches a large and diverse audience no matter your personal point of view on the issue. In this factious story, a famine caused by Blackwell Industries drives Diego Busqueda, a noble ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcoyote,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to lead a band of Mexican border crossers across the unforgiving DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Highway, a desert cursed with blistering days and deadly nights. Back home, DiegoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daughter Flaca discovers that something hungrier prowls the factory fields. Stalked and persecuted, can the Busqueda family maintain their dreams of immigration or will the horrors of the desert tear them apart?\n\n\nNote that in theme of cross border relations that the issues were pulished as english/spanish flipbooks, both languages were included in the files\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archaia.com/blog/titles/feeding-ground&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archaia.com/blog/titles/feeding-ground&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=7147&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=7147&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fangoria.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=4103:feeding-ground-comic-review&amp;option=com_content&amp;catid=54:comics-reviews&amp;Itemid=185&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fangoria.com/index.php?view=article&amp;id=4103:feeding-ground-comic-review&amp;option=com_content&amp;catid=54:comics-reviews&amp;Itemid=185&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nFeeding Ground 01 - One In Ten.cbz 64.1 MB\nFeeding Ground 02 - What Still Remains.cbz 62.7 MB\nFeeding Ground 03 - The Quickened Pulse.cbz 63.6 MB\nFeeding Ground 04 - Severed Ties.cbz 57.5 MB\nFeeding Ground 05 - Fever Dreams.cbz 62.6 MB\nFeeding Ground 06 - Sheep's Clothing.cbz 59.9 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aedeba816161ca03fe1649192936a873bacc4403","amp;dn":"Feeding+Ground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aedeba816161ca03fe1649192936a873bacc4403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,222,186,129,97,97,202,3,254,22,73,25,41,54,168,115,186,204,68,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
