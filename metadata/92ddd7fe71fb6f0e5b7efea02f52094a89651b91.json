A Machine for Pigs. Fit only for the\nslaughtering of Pigs.\n\nFrom the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Dear Esther comes a\nnew first-person horrorgame that will drag you to the depths of greed,\npower and madness. It will bury its snout into your ribs and it will eat\nyour heart.\n\nThe year is 1899\n\nWealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus awakes in his bed, wracked with\nfever and haunted by dreams of a dark and hellish engine. Tortured by\nvisions of a disastrous expedition to Mexico, broken on the failing\ndreams of an industrial utopia, wracked with guilt and tropical disease,\nhe wakes into a nightmare. The house is silent, the ground beneath him\nshaking at the will of some infernal machine: all he knows is that his\nchildren are in grave peril, and it is up to him to save them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92ddd7fe71fb6f0e5b7efea02f52094a89651b91","amp;dn":"Amnesia+A+Maching+FOr+Pigs+for+Mac%2C+Linux%2C+and+Windows%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92ddd7fe71fb6f0e5b7efea02f52094a89651b91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,221,215,254,113,251,111,14,91,126,254,160,47,82,9,74,137,101,27,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
