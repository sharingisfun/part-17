Originally made for TV, the film was tactfully switched to cinema release following the JFK assassination.\n\nThe Killers was intended as the first made-for-television film, setting the template of a running time around 95 minutes filling a two-hour slot once you add the commercial breaks.\nHowever, it was not to be. Although it was shot before Kennedy's assassination, a potential release in the wake of it made Universal nervous. \n\nA scene with Jack Browning performing an assassination in a similar manner to Oswald must have seemed an unnerving coincidence...even more so in retrospect given that the character is played by a man who later became President of the USA.\n\nAs the two killers, Lee Marvin and Clu Gulager are simply superb. The opening sequence in which they extract information about JohnnyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whereabouts from a blind receptionist is utterly chilling (did they really think they could get this on network TV in the mid-1960s?), yet the characters still maintain a strange likability. Their casual banter and off-handed remarks coupled with their cold professionalism sets the stage for a cynical tale of crime at its lowliest.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 812mb\nDuration.... 01:30:45\nCodec.... h264\nFrame Width..... 604\nFrame Height.... 440\nData Rate.... 1123kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 124kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 48KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f1347010317c6f54631c1d782409feb48a773e","amp;dn":"The+Killers+1964+BrRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f1347010317c6f54631c1d782409feb48a773e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,241,52,112,16,49,124,111,84,99,28,29,120,36,9,254,180,138,119,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
