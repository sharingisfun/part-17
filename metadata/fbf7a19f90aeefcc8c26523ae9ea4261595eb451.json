The band have since experienced multiple line-up changes, with guitarist Iommi being the only constant presence in the band through the years. Originally formed in 1968 as a blues rock band, the group soon adopted the Black Sabbath moniker and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars. Despite an association with these two themes, Black Sabbath also composed songs dealing with social instability, political corruption, the dangers of drug abuse and apocalyptic prophecies of the horrors of war.\n\n Osbourne's regular abuse of drugs and alcohol led to his dismissal from the band in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, Black Sabbath endured countless personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists. In 1992, Iommi and Butler rejoined Dio and drummer Vinny Appice to record Dehumanizer. The original line-up reunited with Osbourne in 1997 and released a live album Reunion. Black Sabbath's 19th studio album, 13, which features all of the original members but Ward, was released in June 2013.\n\n Black Sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970) and Master of Reality (1971). They were ranked by MTV as the &quot;Greatest Metal Band&quot; of all time, and placed second in VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 in their &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. They have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance.\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Cross Purposes is the seventeenth studio album by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in January 1994.\n\n Dehumanizer saw the reunion of Mob Rules-era Black Sabbath, but, after the tour, Ronnie James Dio (vocals) and Vinny Appice (drums) departed. They were replaced by former Sabbath vocalist Tony Martin and former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli.\n\n The song &quot;Cardinal Sin&quot; was originally intended to be titled &quot;Sin Cardinal Sin&quot; (or &quot;Sin, Cardinal Sin&quot;) but a printing error on the album sleeve caused the first word to be removed. Sabbath simply adopted the title &quot;Cardinal Sin&quot; as the name of the song.\n\n A promo video in black-and-white was shot for the song &quot;Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;.\n\n &quot;What's the Use?&quot; was released only on the Japanese edition of Cross Purposes, which also contained a free sticker of the artwork. A nearly identical version of the &quot;burning angel&quot; image was featured on a Scorpions single three years earlier.\n\n The album peaked at number 122 on the Billboard 200 charts.\n\n In July 2014, Guitar World magazine ranked Cross Purposes at number six in the &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list.\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Band Members:\n\n Tony Iommi: guitars\n Geezer Butler: bass\n Geoff Nicholls: keyboards\n Tony Martin: vocals\n Bobby Rondinelli: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbf7a19f90aeefcc8c26523ae9ea4261595eb451","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Cross+Purposes+%5B1994%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BJapan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbf7a19f90aeefcc8c26523ae9ea4261595eb451","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,247,161,159,144,174,239,204,140,38,82,58,233,234,66,97,89,94,180,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
