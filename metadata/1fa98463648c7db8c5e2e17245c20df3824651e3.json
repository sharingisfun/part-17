I knew she could not love me any more than she did, husband or no husband, that he could not matter in the same way, that if she made love to David in the morning and me at noon it subtracted nothing from the truth of our love. She did do that, at least once; she told me so. But not to make me jealous, or threaten me in any way, simply as a curious, unexpected event in her life that she knew I would be interested in. Entertained by. We were complete, we were a world and though this world of ours was tightly bounded in time and space, nothing could make it less than whole.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa98463648c7db8c5e2e17245c20df3824651e3","amp;dn":"With+and+Without+You+%5BVM%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa98463648c7db8c5e2e17245c20df3824651e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,169,132,99,100,140,125,184,197,226,225,114,69,194,13,243,130,70,81,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
