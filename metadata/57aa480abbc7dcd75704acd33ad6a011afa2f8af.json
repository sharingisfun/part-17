A nearly flawless set by the power/pop band, singer Belinda Carlisle and her fellow Go Go's run through a set of both new and old tunes to a set of adoring fans. The audience at a concert like this really has fun if it's obvious that the band is having a great time as well, and it looks like the ladies in the band are having a blast on-stage again.\n The Go Go's absolutely rock the house in this terrific Central Park performance where they rip through hits both new and old. Image Entertainment continues their excellence with music releases, providing fantastic audio quality and very good image quality, along with a couple of fun supplements. Highly recommended.\n\nTracklist:\n 1 Head Over Heels\n 2 Skidmarks On My Heart\n 3 Stuck In My Car\n 4 How Much More\n 5 Apology\n 6 Vacation\n 7 Insincere\n 8 Sonic Superslide\n 9 Automatic\n 10 Automatic Rainy Day\n 11 This Town\n 12 Unforgiven\n 13 Beatnik Beach\n 14 Our Lips Are Sealed\n 15 La La Land\n 16 We Got The Beat\n 17 Throw Me A Curve\n 18 I Wanna Be Sedated\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57aa480abbc7dcd75704acd33ad6a011afa2f8af","amp;dn":"The+Go-Go%27s+-+Live+in+Central+Park","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57aa480abbc7dcd75704acd33ad6a011afa2f8af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,170,72,10,187,199,220,215,87,4,172,211,58,214,160,17,175,162,248,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
