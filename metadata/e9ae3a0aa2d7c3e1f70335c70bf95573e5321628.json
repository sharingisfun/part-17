And now, alone in a seedy beachfront motel, she was dead.\n\nParadise Police Chief Jesse Stone doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know her name. Whoever she is, she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deserve to die. Jesse starts digging, only to find himself caught in the crosshairs of a bitter turf war between two ruthless pimps. And more blood will spill before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s over.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9ae3a0aa2d7c3e1f70335c70bf95573e5321628","amp;dn":"Robert+B.+Parker%27s+Damned+if+You+Do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9ae3a0aa2d7c3e1f70335c70bf95573e5321628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,174,58,10,162,215,195,225,247,3,53,199,11,249,85,115,229,50,22,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
