The Boston band formed as a way for lead singer Michael Angelakos to finish an EP he was writing for his girlfriend for Valentine's Day, and that album eventually got picked up and released by Frenchkiss. The EP, Chunk of Change, led to Passion Pit signing with Columbia in the U.K., and an expanded studio budget for Manners, their full-length debut. Like many blog-hype bands before them, the record deal allows them to expand their sonic palette to sound like something more than a bedroom project. Make sure to check out the video for the single &quot;The Reeling&quot;\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n   1. Make Light\n   2. Little Secrets\n   3. Moth's Wings\n   4. The Reeling\n   5.
