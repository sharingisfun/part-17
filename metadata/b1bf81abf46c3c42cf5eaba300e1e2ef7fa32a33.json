Clearly people do find each other without consciously knowing a lot about how it happens.\n\nThis is where I come in. \n\nAs one of the spear-headers of the menÃƒÂ¢??s improvement movement, I treat pickup as a linear science so that you can have control over who you wind up with, and not leave it to the random forces of ÃƒÂ¢??fateÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??luck.ÃƒÂ¢?? \n\nAt the same time, I am one of the few to recognize that pickup can sometimes be a grey area, and that not everything can always fit into an exact scientific model. Knowing when something will work and when it will not is KEY to your progress. \n\nAt RSD, we pride ourselves for creating a model in our programs that caters to every individual, not dispensing dogmatic advice that wonÃƒÂ¢??t work with everybody. We show you how to take the initiative to calibrate the focus of your training wherever you want it, so that you will KNOW what works in a given situation. \n\nJust like our hugely successful live in-field bootcamps, we know how to make our programs resonate with every type of person. The concepts I teach can be tailored to fit your individual goals, so that putting it all together, you have a program that meets all your needs and shortcuts the learning curve.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.getfoundations.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.getfoundations.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1bf81abf46c3c42cf5eaba300e1e2ef7fa32a33","amp;dn":"Real+Social+Dynamics+-+Superconference+-+Foundations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1bf81abf46c3c42cf5eaba300e1e2ef7fa32a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,191,129,171,244,108,60,66,207,94,171,163,0,225,226,239,127,163,42,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
