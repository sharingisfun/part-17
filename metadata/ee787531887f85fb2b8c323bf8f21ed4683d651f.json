If you have Autoplay enabled then the setup routine will automatically\nlaunch. If you do not have Autoplay enabled, then use Explorer to navigate Grand\nTheft Auto: Vice City disc one, and manually launch setup.exe\n\n2000 / XP User Accounts:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City requires to be installed, and run for the first time,\nwith a user account that has ADMINISTRATOR privileges. On the first run of the game,\nwe decide whether or not to use DirectX Texture Compression, and then if necessary\nun-compress the games textures to your Hard Disk. For more information on \nADMINISTRATOR user accounts, see your Windows 2000 / XP manual.\n\nFootprint:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City requires approximately 915 MB of hard disk space if you \nchoose not to install the radio stations to your hard disk. If you copy the Radio \nStations to your hard disk then you will need to have approximately 1.55 GB of free \nspace. If the video card in your computer does not support DirectX Texture \nCompression, then this means an EXTRA 635 MB is required for the un-compressed textures.\n\nRadio Stations:\nDuring Installation, we offer the user the option to copy the Radio Station files from \nthe &quot;PLAY&quot; disc to your hard disk. On some machines this will provide a performance \nbenefit, though you will need to weigh up the benefits, as on slower machines it is \npreferable to have the Radio Stations being played from a device on a separate IDE \nchannel. Note that whether you copy the Radio Stations to hard disk or not, the game \nstill requires the &quot;PLAY&quot; disc to be in your CD / DVD disk at all times.\n\nSave Games:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City uses the &quot;My Documents&quot; directory of the currently \nlogged in user to store the &quot;GTA VICE CITY USER FILES&quot; directory. This is where we \nstore your save games, individual settings files and gameplay statistics. This was \nchosen to allow each user on a Windows 2000 or Windows XP system to have their own\nset of saves, configurations and statistics.\n\nUn-installation:\nWhen Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is uninstalled, we do not delete the &quot;MP3&quot;, &quot;SKINS&quot; \nand &quot;GTA VICE CITY USER FILES&quot; directories. It is up to the user to remove these \nmanually.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 3) GENERAL INFORMATION\n________________________\n\nDirectX:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City requires Microsoft DirectX 9.0 to run. As a consequence\nwe recommend that the video and sound drivers installed are also DirectX 9.0 compliant. \n\nDirectX Texture Compression:\nWhere available, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City will use DirectX Texture Compression. \nIf the video card does NOT offer DirectX Texture Compression, then we require an \nEXTRA 635 MB of hard disk space to create the un-compressed textures (over and above the\n915 MB minimum install / 1.55 GB maximum install).\n\nWindows XP:\nWe recommend manufacturer distributed drivers for Windows XP (i.e. drivers that expose\nthe user controls for changing settings on the particular piece of hardware), instead\nof the default drivers installed by Microsoft as part of the machine setup process. \n\nMemory:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City requires at least 128 MB of memory to run. In most cases \non a computer with 128 MB of Ram, disk swapping will occur. For optimal performance\nat least 256 MB is recommended.\n\nRunning Applications:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City has been designed to take best advantage of the available\nmachine it is running upon, therefore we recommend that you close down all applications \nbefore running Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. We do not support the use of CD emulators,\nand as such these programs will be closed down when run in the background. \n\nVideo Memory:\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City requires a video card with at least 32 MB of video memory \nto run. Grand Theft Auto: Vice City will refuse to run if launched on a machine with\nless than 32 MB of video memory. \n\nIntel Celeron and AMD Duron Processors:\nThese processors play slower than their direct MHz equivalent Pentium III and AMD \nAthlon, as a consequence we recommend 1.2 GHz as the base speed for these processors.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 4) CONFIGURATION\n__________________\n\nSound Provider:\nThe first time you launch Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, we auto-detect the best sound \nprovider for your available Sound Card. You can also manually select alternatives.\nProviders which are not compatible with your Sound Card will not be selectable.\n\nMP3 Volume Boost:\nThis setting allows you to assign an additional boost in the volume that your available\nMP3 files are played back with. This will only be selectable if the game detects the\npresence of MP3 files in the MP3 directory.\n\nDynamic Acoustic Modeling:\nTurning off Dynamic Acoustic Modeling in the Sound Options will give a small performance\ngain.\n\nScreen Resolution:\nSelecting lower Screen Resolutions in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City display setup will\nallow faster gameplay on lower end machines. Also, using 16 bit color, instead of 32 bit \ncolor, will help in these circumstances.\n\nFrame Limit:\nWe do not suggest disabling the &quot;Frame Limit&quot; in the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City display\nSetup page, as this will lead to a more &quot;variable&quot; rate of playback.\n\nVSYNC:\nWe recommend that you make sure you have set your video card to VSYNC ON in your video\ncard advanced options (from Control Panel/Display Properties). \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 5) PC SPECIFIC EXTRAS\n_______________________\n\nSkins:\nThe appearance of Tommy can be altered or changed by editing inside a paint program\na skin file. Skin files need to be 24 bit un-compressed bitmaps of size 256 * 256.\nAn example file is provided in your &quot;SKINS&quot; directory called &quot;TEXTURE_GUIDE.JPG&quot;.\nWhen applied, the skins will only affect Tommy's street outfit, and only in-game,\nnot in cut-scenes.\n\nMP3 Radio Station files:\nWe have provided the ability to play the users own music files instead of the \nRadio Stations. Simply place your MP3 files into your &quot;Grand Theft Auto Vice City/MP3&quot;\ndirectory, and then use the &quot;change station&quot; key to cycle to the MP3 radio station.\nUse the MP3 boost volume control to add extra amplification to your MP3 music files\nto equalize the volume relative to the Radio Stations and Sound Effects.\n\nStat Saving:\nDuring a game, you can output the detailed list of your in-game accomplishments from\nthe STATS menu. On this menu pressing &quot;S&quot; will output a &quot;STATS.TXT&quot; file and a &quot;STATS.HTML&quot;\nfile to the &quot;GTA VICE CITY USER FILES&quot; directory of the currently logged in user.\n\nStandard / Classic mode:\nStandard mode allows for the control of Tommy with Keyboard and Mouse; Classic mode\nis similar to the control system employed in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on the \nPlayStation2 using a control pad.\n\nMouse Steering:\nIn Standard mode, there is an option to allow you to use your mouse to steer vehicles.\nThis is not available in Classic mode.\n\nReplays:\nThe last 30 seconds of gameplay is available as a replay to play back at any time.\nTo use a replay:-\n\n\tF1 - Replay the last 30 seconds of gameplay. \n\tF2 - Save the last 30 seconds of gameplay as a file. \n\tF3 - Recall and show the last saved replay file.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 6) KNOWN ISSUES\n_________________\n\nWindows 98 Installation\nOn some Windows 98 machines, there can be problems with the Installshield version that\nwe use. This can be caused by an invalid &quot;OLEAUT32.DLL&quot; file. Often this file is an\nupdated version to the one that is installed during the machine setup routine. This \nproblem usually manifests itself as an error message when you re-boot your machine after\nDirectX 9.0 setup. \nThis error message is often of the form:- \n\nError number: 0x80070725\nDescription: Incompatible version of the RPC stub\n\nTo correct this problem, un-install Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (If the &quot;Start Bar&quot; and\n&quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; un-install shortcuts do not work, then un-install by launching the\nsetup routine from the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City &quot;INSTALL&quot; disc - this is one of the\nsymptoms of this DCOM error). Once you have un-installed Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,\nperform the following procedure to fix your DCOM installation, then you will be able\nto install Grand Theft Auto: Vice City correctly. We are sorry that we cannot \nredistribute this file, but the Microsoft EULA for this file prevents us doing this.\n\nInstructions to correct this problem (From Microsoft Installshield Support)\n\n1) Download to your Desktop, but do not run, the Distributed Component Object Model \n   (DCOM) file. \n   Windows 98: http://support.installshield.com/kb/files/Q105810/dcom98.exe\n\n2) Select Start &gt; Shutdown \n\n3) Select Restart in MS-DOS mode. \n\n4) At the command prompt c:WINDOWS, enter the following commands on separate lines\n   as shown. Windows automatically restarts. \n\n\tCD c:windowssystem\n\trename oleaut32.dll oleaut32.old\n\texit\n\n5) Ignore the error message: &quot;A required .DLL file, C:windowssystemoleaut32.dll,\n   was not found.&quot; This error message appears because the file was renamed in step 4. \n\n6) Log in as you normally would. \n\n7) Double-click the file you downloaded to your Desktop in step 1. Click Yes\n   to the dialog that opens. The dcom.exe file installs a new oleaut32.dll file. \n\n8) After DCOM has been installed, select Start &gt; Restart.\n\nMore information on this problem, and DCOM:- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?pcode=ALL&amp;articleid=Q105810#addinfo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://support.installshield.com/kb/view.asp?pcode=ALL&amp;articleid=Q105810#addinfo&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom98/dcom1_3.asp\n\nS3 Pro Savage, Savage 4 and Savage 2000 video cards:\nWe found these video cards have missing texture problems in 16 bit color which are\ncured in 32 bit color, so we suggest using these video cards in 32 bit color.\n\n3dfx Voodoo 5 video cards:\nWhile Grand Theft Auto: Vice City does run on Voodoo 5 video cards, the age of the\ndrivers means that there are minor visual artifacts that cannot be corrected, and\nso we do not support this chipset, or previous 3dfx chipsets.\n\nMatrox surround gaming:\nWe have not implemented any support for Matrox Surround Gaming / 3 monitor mode. \nPlease use single monitor mode on Matrox Parhelia video cards.\n\nMatrox G550 and G400 video cards:\nMinor graphic corruptions in the distance while playing Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\nand during the intro movie.\n\nATI Rage 128 video cards:\nMinor graphic corruptions during the intro movie.\n\nSIS 315 video cards:\nMinor graphic corruptions during the intro movie.\n\nMotherboard based sound chips:\nWe have found certain motherboard based sound chipsets do not report having a\nhardware sound buffer, and crash with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. We found that \nrunning Microsoft's &quot;DXDIAG&quot; and performing the sound tests, will present the user\nwith an error message saying that a hardware buffer is not supported, and would you \nlike to use a software buffer. Selecting a software buffer will allow this sound chipset\nto work with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\n\nHard disk de-fragmentation:\nIf you are experiencing short, periodic slowdowns whilst driving, Grand Theft Auto:\nVice City may be having trouble retrieving data at a fast enough rate from your hard\ndisk. It is recommended that you run your systems De-fragmentation utility regularly\nto allow optimum performance.\n\nChanging hardware / re-initialization:\nChanging either your video card or soundcard may mean that you get Grand Theft Auto:\nVice City into an &quot;invalid&quot; settings state for the particular hardware. If you change \nhardware, to prevent having to un-install and re-install Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,\nperform the following:-\nVideo card:- \n\t- delete from the &quot;Grand Theft Auto Vice City/models&quot; directory the files\n\t  &quot;TXD.DIR&quot; and &quot;TXD.IMG&quot; (if they exist)\n\t- delete from the &quot;Grand Theft Auto Vice City/data&quot; directory the file\n\t  &quot;CAPS.DAT&quot;\n\t- delete from the &quot;Documents and Settings/Current logged-in User/\n\t  My Documents/GTA Vice City User Files&quot; directory the &quot;GTA_VC.SET&quot; file.\nSound Card:- \n\t- delete from the &quot;Documents and Settings/Current logged-in User/\n\t  My Documents/GTA Vice City User Files&quot; directory the &quot;GTA_VC.SET&quot; file.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n 7) DRIVERS\n____________\n\nVideo Drivers:\nWe recommend using the latest available Video drivers for your video card. Where\navailable use the video chipset manufacturers &quot;Reference&quot; drivers in preference to\nvideo card manufacturer customized drivers or Microsoft WHQL certified drivers.\n\nThis means for nVidia based cards Detonator 4 series drivers, and for ATI based cards\nCatalyst 3 series drivers.\n\nBelow for convenience are common video card manufacturer's websites. Grand Theft Auto:\nVice City may not support some or all video cards by a particular manufacturer. Inclusion\nof a manufacturer in this list does not mean there are any assurances of compatibility.\n\n3Dlabs \t\t\t- http://www.3dlabs.com/\nAsus \t\t\t- http://www.asus.com/\nATI \t\t\t- http://support.atitech.ca/\nCreative Labs \t\t- http://www.creativelabs.com/\nGuillemot \t\t- http://www.guillemot.com/\nHercules \t\t- http://www.hercules.com/\nIntel\t\t\t- http://www.intel.com/\nLeadtek \t\t- http://www.leadtek.com/\nMatrox \t\t\t- http://www.matrox.com/\nnVidia \t\t\t- http://www.nvidia.com/\nS3 Graphics\t \t- http://www.s3graphics.com/\nSis \t\t\t- http://www.sis.com.tw/\nVIA\t\t\t- http://www.viatech.com/\nVideoLogic \t\t- http://www.videologic.com/\n\n\nMotherboard Chipset Drivers:\nPlease ensure your motherboard chipset drivers are updated to the latest available\nversions.
