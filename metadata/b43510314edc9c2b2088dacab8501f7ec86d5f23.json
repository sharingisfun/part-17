R E L E A S E  N O T E S ..\n\nIts been over half a year since Ellen\nAlliens album Dust first saw the light of\nnight. And since then it has been impossible\nto get away from the strangely glittering\nfairy dust that graced the albums cover. On\nyour skin, your clothes, in your nose, and\nabove all, in your ears. Dust truly left its\nmark. Anyone that had anything to do with\ntechno in 2010 couldnt avoid experiencing\nEllens most personal and without a doubt most\nmature reflection of her own being, a\nsparkling gem full of pop appeal and\nunexpected twists and turns. And why would\nthey want to? It unites many facets into one\nalthough the album, which was produced\ntogether with Tobias Freund (whose projects\ninclude tobias., Pink Elln, and Sieg ber\nDie Sonne), is extremely diverse and\nwide-ranging, it is also a coherent impression\nof a singular personality. A snapshot of an\nartist who was one of the first to begin\nhammering Berliner Techno into stone, and\nsince then has worked tirelessly at molding\nand shaping its perfect form. So it really\ncomes as no surprise that these remixes are\njust as impressive as Ellens original LP\nthanks to the multiple perspectives they\nprovide. Placing the tracks in different (yet\nwell-selected) hands was supposed to be a\nsimple experiment, but what was originally\nintended to only be released digitally ended\nup being so impressive that a decision was\nmade to turn it into the tactile experience of\na silver disc. The result is thirteen\nadaptations of the material on Dust which\ntransition between multiple varieties of\nHouse, Techno, Disco, and Ambient as if the\nidea of different categories never existed.\nHere, a rigid structure takes a backseat to\ncreative freedom. The artists selected for\nthis project come from completely different\nstylistic camps, and can without a doubt be\nreferred to as key players in todays club\nsound. The innovators. The musicians\nmusicians. The secret stars. This compilation\noffers a total of thirteen tracks which each\npresent a different, individual idea of what\nthe word remix means. The storied art of\ntaking pieces of something already available\nand creating something new. And the result is\ndefinitely quite impressive. The remixes which\nstand out the most are probably the incredible\ncover of Flashy Flashy by Nicolas Jaar, this\nseasons soul house brother, the remix of\nShould We Go Home by John Roberts (debut\nalbum entitled Glass Eights, released by\nDial, 2010), as well as the remix of Ellens\npop song You by Munk, from the Munich-based\nlabel Gomma.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43510314edc9c2b2088dacab8501f7ec86d5f23","amp;dn":"Ellen_Allien--Dust_Remixes-%28BPC233%29-2011-OMA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43510314edc9c2b2088dacab8501f7ec86d5f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,53,16,49,78,220,156,43,32,136,218,202,184,80,31,126,200,109,95,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
