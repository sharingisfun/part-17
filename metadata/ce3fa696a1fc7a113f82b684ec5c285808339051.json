The distribution, purposefully stuffed with broken, ill-configured, outdated and exploitable software, began life as a training system used during the author's university lectures. Its primary goal is to design a Linux system that is as vulnerable as possible -- in order to teach and demonstrate a variety of security topics, including reverse code engineering, buffer overflows, shell code development, web exploitation, and SQL injection.\n\nIt had all but disappeared from the internets, so here's a re-upload of it.\n\nBootloader claims strychnine (1.2), wall when you're in x claims infectious disease (1.5). Fuck if I care. Can't be bothered to dig deeper to verify which is accurate. It's DVL, it's a re-upload. Provided as is. Deploy outside of a sandbox at your own risk. Whiners can fuck off.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce3fa696a1fc7a113f82b684ec5c285808339051","amp;dn":"Damn+Vulnerable+Linux+1.5+-+Infectious+Disease","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce3fa696a1fc7a113f82b684ec5c285808339051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,63,166,150,161,252,122,17,63,130,182,132,236,92,40,88,8,51,144,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
