Seven years later John Romita, Sr. tweaked the design of the character's uniform.[2] Nova debuted in Nova #1 in 1976, written by Wolfman and drawn by John Buscema. Wolfman intended the teenage character to be an homage to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's Spider-Man, down to his humble working-class roots and alliterative alter-ego.[3] The original Nova series, The Man Called Nova,[4] lasted 25 issues from September 1976 to May 1979. Dangling plot lines were resolved in issues 206-214 of Fantastic Four (also by Wolfman) and issue 24 of Rom the Spaceknight. The character then disappeared into obscurity until returning as a member of the original New Warriors team debuting in The Mighty Thor #411 (December 1989), and continuing through New Warriors #1-75, Annual #1-4 (July 1990Ã¢â‚¬â€September 1996)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32daa4b2a5ec9f5cbd3c890ea09602dd114ba42","amp;dn":"Nova+V1+%281976%29+001-025+%28digital%29+%28Falaaee%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32daa4b2a5ec9f5cbd3c890ea09602dd114ba42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,45,170,75,42,94,201,245,203,211,200,144,234,9,96,45,209,20,186,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
