Set in a post-punk, post-apocalyptic American wasteland where the survivors are divided into two groups -- sex positives and sex negatives. The positives are &quot;forced&quot; to perform live sex cabaret shows at various Cafes. The negatives watch, unable to perform. This black comedy benefits from a great script by Jerry (&quot;Permanent Midnight&quot;) Stahl and superb direction from Rinse Dream. You haven't lived until you see the bizarre cabaret skits and musical set-ups. Truly inventive stuff here, despite its low budget. \n\n\nSimply great!\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083707/\n\ni couldn.t decide between porn and movie category...\n\nOH, CUNT LOVERS, PLEASE SEED! It.s a rare movie and I won.t be able to seed it for a very long time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f6dca1f5fb2befed47146b9bce44e5fde42fe55","amp;dn":"Caf%C3%83%C2%A9+Flesh+%5BSci-Fi+porn%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f6dca1f5fb2befed47146b9bce44e5fde42fe55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,109,202,31,95,178,190,254,212,113,70,185,188,228,78,95,222,66,254,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
