It is a concept album telling the story of a futuristic society that destroys itself, reforms many years later, and eventually destroys itself again in the same way it originally did. The band's guitarist has stated that the album's basic theme is the fact that humanity in general doesn't seem to learn from its mistakes. Three music videos were released from this album for the tracks &quot;The End of the World&quot;, &quot;Chains of Humanity&quot;, and &quot;To the Fallen Hero&quot;. There is a special edition DualDisc version of this album, which features a DVD documentary about the making IV: Constitution of Treason entitled &quot;The Act of Treason&quot;.
