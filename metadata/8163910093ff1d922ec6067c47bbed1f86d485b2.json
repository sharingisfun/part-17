With millions of devoted fans and ten New York Times bestsellers to date, McNaught is a writer whose work just gets better with each new novelÃ¢â‚¬â€œand Every Breath You Take is the book readers have been waiting for. Returning to the lavish Chicago setting of her popular novel Paradise, and revisiting some of that bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characters as well, this story will captivate in inimitable Judith McNaught style.\n\nHigh atop a snow-covered hill, the stately old Wyatt mansion is perched like a crown, its stone spires pointing upward, its stained glass windows glowing like colorful jewels. Such opulence means success and, surely, happiness. But on the eve of wealthy philanthropist Cecil WyattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eightieth birthday, all the money in the world wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring back his missing grandson, William Wyatt. The only thing for certain: Foul play was involved.\n\nThe family, the police, the mediaÃ¢â‚¬â€œall have tried in vain to discover the young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate. Now suspicion has turned shockingly toward WilliamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own half-brother, the rather distant and enigmatic Mitchell Wyatt.\n\nKate Donovan never dreamed that a chance romantic encounter on a tropical island paradise would tag her as a suspect in a high-society murder case. But after Kate tangles with the darkly charismatic Mitchell Wyatt, she finds herself cast in a shadow of guilt and mistrust. As the Chicago police tighten their net, it will take all of KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ingenuity to clear her name. With her calm, cool wit, and the help of a man who may or may not be a dangerous catch, Kate vows to claim the life and love she desires","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8163910093ff1d922ec6067c47bbed1f86d485b2","amp;dn":"Every+Breath+You+Take+-+Judith+McNaught","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8163910093ff1d922ec6067c47bbed1f86d485b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,99,145,0,147,255,29,146,46,198,6,124,71,187,237,31,134,212,133,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
