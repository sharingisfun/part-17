Gary Oldmans metamorphosis as Dracula ?who grows from old to young, from man to beast? is nothing short of amazing. Winona Ryder brings equal intensity to the role of a young beauty who becomes the object of Draculas devastating desire. Anthony Hopkins co-stars as the famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula, and then dares to confront him. Opulent, dazzling and utterly irresistible, this is Dracula as youve never seen him. And once youve seen BRAM STOKERS DRACULA, youll never forget it.\n\nOther features:\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access, Filmographies, Theatrical trailer\n\nRipped: DvdFabDecripter + DvdRemake + DvdRebuilder + CEE (9pass)\n\nDeleted Trailer DVD and documentary.\n\nwww.solodvd.org\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4876b2c625eeb1a7896d98069a63b7e93bc9466a","amp;dn":"Bram+Stoker%5C%27s+Dracula","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4876b2c625eeb1a7896d98069a63b7e93bc9466a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,118,178,198,37,238,177,167,137,109,152,6,154,99,183,233,59,201,70,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
