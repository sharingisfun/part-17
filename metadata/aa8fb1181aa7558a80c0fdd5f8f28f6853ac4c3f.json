After an initial examination to determine current health conditions and to establish any necessary treatment, life in the animal rescue can begin. Animal Rescue Sunflower isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an animal zoo. You have to take care of your little friend with food and water and make sure that they always have fresh litter. When they have everything they need, pretty soon they'll feel fit as a fiddle again!\n\nFIND NEW HOMES FOR CUTE CATS, DOGS, BUNNIES AND OTHER TINY PETS\n\nOf course the animals are in the best possible hands with you, but they do eventually need a real home. As soon as the head of the animal rescue, a grumpy professor, puts you in charge of the animal adoption process, it's your job to find the most suitable new animal owner like the cute little cat, the small hamster or the sweet bunnie. When you pay attention to the animal's needs and the owner's preferences, nothing can stand in the way of their happiness.\n\nANIMAL GAME APP WITH FANTASTIC 3D GRAPHICS\n\n&quot;PetWorld 3D: My Animal Rescue&quot; is not only a lot of fun, it's also visually pleasing. Move through the impressive 3D world of the animal rescue while scooping water out of the well or getting the right food. When you visit the animals you can also see them at close range and you can observe how the hamsters clean themselves, how the bunnies hop around, how the little horse or the cat is waiting for you.\n\nPLAYFUL LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS\n\nKids love animals and they are interested in the nature around them. &quot;PetWorld 3D: My Animal Rescue&quot; is more than an animal zoo. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a simulation game where children and adults regardless of age learn in a playful way how to take care of animals.\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tivola.petworld.rescue.gp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tivola.petworld.rescue.gp&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8fb1181aa7558a80c0fdd5f8f28f6853ac4c3f","amp;dn":"PetWorld+3D%3A+My+Animal+Rescue+v2.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8fb1181aa7558a80c0fdd5f8f28f6853ac4c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,143,177,24,26,167,85,138,128,192,253,213,248,242,143,104,83,172,76,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
