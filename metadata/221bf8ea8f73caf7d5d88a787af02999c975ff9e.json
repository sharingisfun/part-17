A pioneer in children's TV, Roberts hit the country charts in 1949-1950 with I Never See Maggie Alone and Choc'late Ice Cream Cone, both novelty songs, which largely set the standard for his career. These 29 songs are Roberts' complete recordings for Coral and Decca from 1949-1957 and they offer plenty of yodeling! The vocals of Roberts receive outstanding support from the cream of 'Nashville Cats' with Jerry Byrd, Don Helms, Tommy Jackson, Hank Garland and Grady Martin. CD includes 16-page booklet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:221bf8ea8f73caf7d5d88a787af02999c975ff9e","amp;dn":"Kenny+Roberts+-+Jumpin%27+%26amp%3B+Yodelin%27+-+Bear+Family+CD+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"221bf8ea8f73caf7d5d88a787af02999c975ff9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,27,248,234,143,115,202,247,213,216,138,120,122,240,41,153,201,117,255,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
