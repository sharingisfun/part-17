In 1950 they collaborated again on a film about jazz improvisation that was never completed. This footage has now been combined with other film of jazz improvisation shot by Granz at different times and locations to create this new film. Included is material by Mili in 1950, Duke Ellington at the Cote D'Azur, Count Basie at Montreux Jazz Festival in 1977, Joe Pass in 1979, Ella Fitzgerald in 1979, and Oscar Peterson at Montreux in 1977. Extras of Granz narrated by Nat Hentoff, portraits by David Stone Martin, extra rushes, interviews, photo gallery, and original 1944 Jammin' the blues film.\nInarguably one of the most important figures in 20th-century American music, jazz impresario Norman Granz introduced live jazz to mainstream audiences with his Jazz at the Philharmonic concert series. This program celebrates Granz' pioneering legacy with live-performance clips of many of jazz's improvisational masters, including Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Ella Fitzgerald, and Lester Young.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mili's Studio Sequence, 1950, featuring Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Ella Fitzgerald, Lester Young, Hank Jones, Ray Brown, and Buddy Rich. \n1&gt; &quot;Ballade,&quot;  2&gt;&quot;Celebrity,&quot;3&gt; &quot;Ad Lib,&quot;4&gt; &quot;Pennies from Heaven,&quot; 5&gt; &quot;Blues for Greasy.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Duke Ellington at the Cote D'Azur \n 6&gt; &quot;Blues for Joan Miro&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Count Basie at the Montreux Jazz Festival, 1977, \n7&gt;&quot;Nob's Blues,&quot;  8&gt;&quot;Kidney Stew,&quot; 9&gt;&quot;These Foolish Things&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Joe Pass, 1979, \n10&gt; &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'&quot; 11&gt; &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ella Fitzgerald, 1979, \n12&gt; &quot;Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me&quot; 13&gt;&quot;I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Oscar Peterson at the Montreux Jazz Festival, 1977, featuring Dizzy Gillespie, Clark Terry, and Eddie Lockjaw David \n14 &quot;Ali &amp; Frazier.&quot;\n\nFormat: \nGeneral: avi \nVideo: Mpeg Visual/Divx\nAudio: MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer 3 Joint stereo\nResolution: 640 x 496 pixels\nFrames per Second: 29.970\nLanguage: English\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f506fd7ba1da369521132bfb499e95525033a80f","amp;dn":"Improvisations+Norman+Granz+%5BCharlie+Parker+Lester+Young+and+mor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f506fd7ba1da369521132bfb499e95525033a80f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,6,253,123,161,218,54,149,33,19,43,251,73,158,149,82,80,51,168,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
