Disdaining the glittery world of balls and courtship, Olivia prefers to spend her time writing fiery political essays under a pseudonym for London's leading newspaper. But when her columns attract the attention of the oh-so-proper Earl of Wrexham, Olivia suddenly finds herself dancing on the razor's edge of scandal. With the help of her sisters, she tries to stay one step ahead of trouble...\n\nHowever, after a series of madcap misadventures, Wrexham, a former military hero who is fighting for social reform in Parliament, discovers Olivia's secret. To her surprise, he proposes a temporary alliance to help win passage of his bill. Passion flares between them, but when a political enemy kidnaps the earl's young son, they must make some dangerous decisions...and trust that love will conquer all.\n\nAuthor:\n\nCara has garnered numerous accolades for her writing, including two Daphne Du Maurier Awards for Historical Mystery/Suspense and two RITAs nominations for Regency Romance. She also writes a historical mystery series under the nom de plume Andrea Penrose and Regency Romance under the name of Andrea Pickens.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cf0d162fa3db63abaf783fee4b04ce6d45b78c","amp;dn":"Scandalously+Yours+%28Hellions...%231%29+%282014%29+Cara+Elliott+%28multi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cf0d162fa3db63abaf783fee4b04ce6d45b78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,207,13,22,47,163,219,99,171,175,120,63,238,75,4,206,109,69,183,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
