It describes our place in time and space, how we got here and where we are going. It will take you on a journey from the beginning of time to the end of the universe to uncover our origins and reveal our destiny. It will explain how mankind acquired this knowledge starting from the beginning of civilization when the ancient Greeks first began to ask questions about the nature of the world around them.\n\n\n Ben Moore takes us on a path of discovery that connects astrophysics with subjects as varied as biology, neuroscience and evolution; from the origin of atoms to how stars shine and die, from ants and elephants to space travel and extra-terrestrial life. But as our universe grows older and its stars fade away and stop shining, can life continue for eternity or is all life destined for complete extinction? And what is the purpose of all of this anyway?!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6c11dfd6b4fb9e69e3e07c4bec632d7e5765db6","amp;dn":"Elephants+in+Space%3A+The+Future+of+Life+and+the+Universe+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6c11dfd6b4fb9e69e3e07c4bec632d7e5765db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,193,29,253,107,79,185,230,158,62,7,196,190,198,50,215,229,118,93,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
