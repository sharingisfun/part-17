The album had a huge success in Portugal, reaching a six-time platinum album level (240 000 unities sold), but didn't have the international success that some critics and fans predicted. The album has 15 songs, including a hidden track, and two versions of &quot;A Little Respect&quot; by Erasure. Most of the songs are in English, with only two in Portuguese, &quot;Sextos Sentidos&quot;, a duet with SÃƒÂ©rgio Godinho, and &quot;Eu NÃƒÂ£o Sei Dizer&quot;. The songs deal with themes of love, pain, melancholy, loss, death, sorrow, loneliness and nostalgia, themes that are recurrent in Silence 4 and David Fonseca solo career discography. Both &quot;Borrow&quot; and &quot;My Friends&quot; were highly successful singles.\nTrack listing\n\nMusic and lyrics by David Fonseca, except where noted.\n\n    &quot;Goodbye Tomorrow&quot;\n    &quot;Borrow&quot;\n    &quot;Dying Young&quot; (lyrics, Bruno Urbano)\n    &quot;Old Letters&quot;\n    &quot;Angel Song&quot;\n    &quot;My Friends&quot;\n    &quot;A (Very) Little Respect&quot; (Vince Clark, Andy Bell)\n    &quot;Sextos Sentidos&quot; (lyrics, SÃƒÂ©rgio Godinho, music, Rui Costa)\n    &quot;We&quot;\n    &quot;Breeders&quot; (lyrics, Bruno Urbano)\n    &quot;Eu NÃƒÂ£o Sei Dizer&quot;\n    &quot;Cry&quot; (music, Rui Costa)\n    &quot;A Little Respect&quot; (Vince Clark, Andy Bell)\n    &quot;Teeth Against The Glass&quot;\n    &quot;Sex Freak&quot; (hidden track)\n\nRipped from CD (legally) and uploaded in 2014. 188kb high quality.
