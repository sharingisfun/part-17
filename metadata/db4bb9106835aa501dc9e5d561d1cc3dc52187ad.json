I included all of the issues currently available. \n\nNote: Issue 27 is meant to be read after Issue 18. They did a time jump, and that was the order it was released. Then they went back to Issue 19. Issue 27.2 is the &quot;Second Helping Edition&quot; which came out after 26 and it just slightly different than the original Issue 27.\n\nAlso included is the one-shot Secret Agent Poyo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db4bb9106835aa501dc9e5d561d1cc3dc52187ad","amp;dn":"Chew+%231-27+Plus+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db4bb9106835aa501dc9e5d561d1cc3dc52187ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,75,185,16,104,53,170,80,29,201,229,213,97,209,204,61,197,33,135,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
