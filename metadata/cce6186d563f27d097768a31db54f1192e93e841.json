From her Count Your Blessings, and Reach for a Thought That Feels Better, she carries us through to the rollicking I Want to Live My Life to the Fullest, and on to the elegant, meditative Joy to the Universe.\n\nThe second half of the album promises to give the listener a first in a lifetime experience. You will be enraptured when you immerse yourself in 30 minutes of Abraham&amp;#039;s Rampages of Well-Being. Over Francine&amp;#039;s haunting Mayan Theme, we have blended, from three live workshops, Abraham&amp;#039;s Living Happily Ever After and Finding My Core Beliefs, and finally Abraham reminds us that our Well-Being is natural with their never-to-be-forgotten It Is Good To Feel Good.\n\n\t1.
