Some 50 countries over four continents have flown the MiG-21, and it still serves many nations a half-century after its maiden flight. The fighter made aviation records. At least by name, it is the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history and the most-produced combat aircraft since the Korean War, and it had the longest production run of a combat aircraft (1959 to 1985 over all variants).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef1795a7e299e99d70d461d8737b64f4faa05a45","amp;dn":"Mikoyan+MiG+21+%28Famous+Russian+Aircraft%29amitks93","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef1795a7e299e99d70d461d8737b64f4faa05a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,23,149,167,226,153,233,157,112,212,97,216,115,123,100,244,250,160,90,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
