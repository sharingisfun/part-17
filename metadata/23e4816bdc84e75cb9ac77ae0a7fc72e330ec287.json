Two is 1938-1939. Disc three is 1938-1940, except tracks 13-15, from 1945. Included are tracks by His Orchestra and the Gramercy Five, and vocalists Helen Forrest, Lena Horne and Billie Holiday.\n\nThe song &quot;Streamline&quot; in the first folder is of special interest because it is in true stereo. There were two microphones recording two places in the room to two different disks during the same performance. In the 1990s, the two were combined to one to create a seperate spectrum, left and right, thus being one of the oldest stereo recordings, though retroactively.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23e4816bdc84e75cb9ac77ae0a7fc72e330ec287","amp;dn":"Artie+Shaw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23e4816bdc84e75cb9ac77ae0a7fc72e330ec287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,228,129,107,220,132,231,92,185,172,119,174,10,127,199,46,51,14,194,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
