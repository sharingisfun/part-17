Not so for Lynne BarrÃ‚â€™s groundbreaking book Reversible Knitting. Not only is every one of the 50 stitch patterns completely new and never before seen, but each is also reversibleÃ‚â€”for a total of 100 different looks!Reversible stitch patterns can be used to create projects where either side can be worn facing outward, or where two sides of the piece are visible simultaneously (such as a scarf or a garment with collar or cuffs that that can be worn up or down). In addition to stitch patterns, the book features 20 such projectsÃ‚â€”from accessories like scarves, hats, and socks to sweaters and dressesÃ‚â€”designed by the author and by 12 top knitwear designers including STC authors VÃƒÂ©ronik Avery, Norah Gaughan, and Teva Durham. Rounding out the book are in-depth instructions for the specialized techniques required for reversilbe work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103978ee38e5b4d21063e9622c8a8cbe536f0778","amp;dn":"Reversible+Knitting%3A50+Brand-New%2CGroundbreaking+Stitch+Patterns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103978ee38e5b4d21063e9622c8a8cbe536f0778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,57,120,238,56,229,180,210,16,99,233,98,44,138,140,190,83,111,7,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
