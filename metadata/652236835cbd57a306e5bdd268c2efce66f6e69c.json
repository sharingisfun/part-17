It is version 5.0, I'm not sure if that's the latest,but its what I got.\nI hope you have fun understanding the Dev Kit, and have fun making games for he N64!\nNote: I've tested this,and most works on Windows 8.1, some need compatibility settings, some can't run. If you have a windows XP or 98, it should work fine though.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:652236835cbd57a306e5bdd268c2efce66f6e69c","amp;dn":"N64+SDK+5.0+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"652236835cbd57a306e5bdd268c2efce66f6e69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,34,54,131,92,189,87,163,6,229,189,210,104,194,239,206,102,246,230,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
