Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994. Now it has version 4.0.3 with numerous improvements and refinements over the original release.\nPHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nSeed N Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f6523261c7f7b353782d1a9ce84491b72342c5f","amp;dn":"Learn+Basic+PHP+in+6+Weeks-Ascetic_trip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f6523261c7f7b353782d1a9ce84491b72342c5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,101,35,38,28,127,123,53,55,130,209,169,206,132,73,27,114,52,44,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
