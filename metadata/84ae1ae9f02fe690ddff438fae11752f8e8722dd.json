Led by singer/songwriter Wally Tax, the group was quite comparable to England's Pretty Things in their fine raw, punky R&amp;B/pop with basic but riveting hooks. Like the Pretty Things, the Outsiders (who sang entirely in English) made similar psychedelic/progressive ventures in the late '60s that cut loose from their R&amp;B roots without losing sight of them entirely. Recording several albums of material (consisting wholly of original compositions) between 1965 and 1969, the group tempered their punky, almost proto-hardcore ravers with melancholy, pensive folk-rockers and unpredictable production touches ranging from Baroque mandolins and harpsichords to found radio static. The Outsiders' music was fraught with tension, the punkish rhythms playing against the melodic tunes, the R&amp;B sensibilities against the pop hooks, often within the same song. They were unknown on an international level to all but the most fervent '60s collectors. Wally Tax moved to the U.S. in the early '70s, where he recorded one album as the leader of the band Tax Free.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:gxfuxqlgldte&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:gxfuxqlgldte&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbum Review excerpt:\n\nPrior to the 2002 release of this compilation, everything done by the Outsiders was well-represented on CD except for the bulk of their singles. That was a shame, as their dozen 1965-1969 singles contained much of their best work. That gap is entirely rectified by this exemplary compilation, which includes both sides of all dozen of their 1965-1969 singles. ....\n\nThe entire review at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0ifixqwaldfe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:0ifixqwaldfe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
