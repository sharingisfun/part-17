Do you want to make sure you finish? Will you get lost and fizzle out? Will you spend more time reading about how to write than actually getting the words down?\r\n\r\nMost books on novel-writing will make you read hundreds of pages about character arcs, inciting incidents, heroesâ€™ journeys. Itâ€™s great to know that â€“ but while youâ€™re reading about it youâ€™re not writing your book. \r\n\r\nAnd what these books donâ€™t tell you is how to use this learning and get the job done.\r\n\r\nNail Your Novel is a writing buddy â€“ and mentor - in a book. \r\n\r\nIn 10 easy steps it will tell you:\r\n*how to shape your big idea and make a novel out of it\r\n*how to do your research and how to use it\r\n*how to organise your time. \r\n*how to plot and build characters\r\n*when youâ€™re going to hit problems and what to do about them\r\n*how to write on the days you donâ€™t feel inspired\r\n*how to reread what youâ€™ve written and polish it. \r\n\r\nAlong the way, Thumbnail Notes give tutorials about storytelling and storycraft â€“ strictly when you need them. The author has written nearly a dozen novels that have made it into print â€“ and this is how she did it. \r\n\r\nYou donâ€™t even need to read the whole book before you get started. You read a section, then do as it says. And, once youâ€™re finally satisfied, Nail Your Novel will tell you how to sell it to publishers and agents.\r\n\r\nYouâ€™ve dreamed of writing a novel. Donâ€™t procrastinate with another theory book. Donâ€™t launch in, get stuck and throw your hard work in a drawer. Nail your novel. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the author\r\nRoz Morris has nearly two decades of experience writing novels and helping floundering authors find their way. She is a senior book doctor for a major literary consultancy in London, writes fiction under her own name and has ghostwritten bestselling fiction for high-profile writers with major publishers, including Random House, Puffin and Mammoth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67112800c79d74fb6fec2f28c6c2e54ffbf6927","amp;dn":"Nail+Your+Novel%3A+Why+Writers+Abandon+Books+and+How+You+Can+Draft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67112800c79d74fb6fec2f28c6c2e54ffbf6927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,113,18,128,12,121,215,79,182,254,194,242,140,108,46,84,255,191,105,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
