Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers). \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tDeram\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Green Are Your Eyes\n02.Scarborough Fair\n03.Cockleshells\n04.The Last Thing On My Mind\n05.The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n06.Sally Free And Easy\n07.Sunny Goodge Street\n08.How Should I Your True Love Know\n09.She Moved Thu' The Fair\n10.North Country Maid\n11.Lullaby\n12.Wild Mountain Thyme\n13.The Most Of What Is Least\n14.Come My Way #2\n15.Mary Ann #2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                    ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9296f2bd8b4ebf0c3370e8a029c9003ced8064b7","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+North+County+Maid+%281966%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9296f2bd8b4ebf0c3370e8a029c9003ced8064b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,150,242,189,139,78,191,12,51,112,232,160,41,201,0,60,237,128,100,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
