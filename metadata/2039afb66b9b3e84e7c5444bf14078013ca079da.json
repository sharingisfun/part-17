So that is everything needed to update from a PC, assuming you have Kies installed with the latest USB drivers. The text file does include a link with instructions. And I successfully updated my tablet. But I urge caution as not to brick your Galaxy Tab. Use Odin to install the firmware, and turn Kies off is important.\n\nMy Galaxy Tab 7.0 plus is very powerful, so thank-you Samsung for a superior piece of hardware, but f.u. for your crappy firmware support.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2039afb66b9b3e84e7c5444bf14078013ca079da","amp;dn":"Galaxy+Tab+GT+P6210+Jelly+Bean+firmware","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2039afb66b9b3e84e7c5444bf14078013ca079da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,57,175,182,107,155,62,132,231,197,68,75,241,64,120,1,60,160,121,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
