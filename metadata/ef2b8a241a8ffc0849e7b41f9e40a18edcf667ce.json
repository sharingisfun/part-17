Director De Sica collaborated with another neorealist pioneer, Cesare Zavattini, on the screenplay. The film, a real tearjerker, concerns a young mother (Isa Pola) who can&amp;#039;t stand the pressures exerted on her by family responsibilities. She deserts her husband (Emilio Cigoli) and her brood, permanently ruining the life of her four-year-old son, Prico (Luciano de Ambrosis). Avoiding the rococo gestures and dramatic overstatement that might have attended this film had it been made in Hollywood, De Sica fashions a subtle tale about real people caught up in a real situation. De Sica&amp;#039;s sensitivity toward the younger cast members of The Children Are Watching Us would manifest itself in many of his formative films, notably SciusciÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  and The Bicycle Thief. Made in 1942, the film was not released in Italy until 1944.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : I Bambini Ci Guardano.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.09 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1850 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 5.38 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1655 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.223\n      StreamSize : 1000 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 115 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0034493\n\nItalian audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2b8a241a8ffc0849e7b41f9e40a18edcf667ce","amp;dn":"I+Bambini+Ci+Guardano+-+Vittorio+De+Sica+%281944%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2b8a241a8ffc0849e7b41f9e40a18edcf667ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,43,138,36,26,143,252,8,73,231,180,31,158,64,161,142,220,246,103,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
