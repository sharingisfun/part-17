Beginning with the &quot;long version&quot; of the chiming drive of &quot;Hollow Horse&quot; from The Small Price of a Bicycle, this collection fully showcases McNabb's passionate, elegant quaver and driving songwriting, as well as the abilities of the fine Layhe/Sharrock rhythm section. \nThe three biggest hits get pride of place near the start: &quot;Love Is a Wonderful Colour,&quot; &quot;Birds Fly&quot; (with wry comments from McNabb on its stateside re-titling as &quot;Whisper to a Scream&quot;), and &quot;Understanding Jane.&quot; This last one appears in a 1992 version via remixing and extra overdubs by McNabb, but it's still a perfect blast of just-sly-enough pop/punk. He does a similar remix job with Small Price's gentler &quot;When It All Comes Down,&quot; with equally fine results. &quot;High Time,&quot; meanwhile, surfaces in its wonderful acoustic version from the &quot;Kiss Off&quot; single, while an otherwise unreleased track, the brooding, dramatic &quot;Firepower,&quot; was recorded shortly before the original lineup collapsed.
