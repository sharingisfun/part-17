Recorded in August 1973. Digitally remastered by Joseph M. Palmaccio. HYMN OF THE 7TH GALAXY, its hyper speed momentum aside, shares many of the characteristics of prog rock: flashy playing, incredibly complex instrumental passages and arrangements, awry and tangled time signatures, and a propensity towards raw energy intermingled with electronics. Everyone here plays as if there were no tomorrow. Chick Corea's supercharged electric piano and organ licks alternate between fire-breathing tone clusters and atmospheric grace. Guitarist Bill Connors plays like a comet circling a supernova; Stanley Clarke's earthquake-inducing bass lines are both monstrous and finger-poppin' funky, while drummer Lenny White simply beats his kit to jelly. Feel the power: the protoplasmic funk of &quot;After the Cosmic Rain,&quot; the Fender Rhodes symphonies and ecstatic drumming of &quot;Captain Senor Mouse,&quot; the far-out space-bop of the title track. Super hot stuff from one of jazz-rock's cornerstones","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:083720ad4d97802e9447f5d23e7cb4a0df1eb74e","amp;dn":"Return+to+forever%2C+featuring+Chick+Corea+-+Hymn+of+the+Seventh+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"083720ad4d97802e9447f5d23e7cb4a0df1eb74e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,55,32,173,77,151,128,46,148,71,245,210,62,124,180,160,223,30,183,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
