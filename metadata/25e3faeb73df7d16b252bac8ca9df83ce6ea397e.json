They were formed by Graham Massey, Martin Price and Gerald Simpson, and they released their debut Newbuild in 1988. The band really hit the big time during the &quot;second summer of love&quot; in 1989 when their song &quot;Pacific State&quot; was picked up by Radio 1 DJ Gary Davies. Davies played the record every day for 3 months on his national primetime lunchtime show until it was released as a single. His promotion singlehandedly helped propel the acid house group to the top of the UK charts and into the public consciousness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e3faeb73df7d16b252bac8ca9df83ce6ea397e","amp;dn":"808+State+-+Ex-El","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e3faeb73df7d16b252bac8ca9df83ce6ea397e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,227,250,235,115,223,125,22,178,82,186,200,202,157,248,60,230,234,57,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
