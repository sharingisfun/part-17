The album's one previously unreleased title is a Marion Evans\narrangement of the traditional &quot;What Child is This. Bennett appears in orchestral, big\nband and small combo settings, and though the original albums can still be found, this\nprovides a nice sampling across forty years of his stylish takes on holiday standards.\nBennett sings with a jazzy cool unparalleled by his peers or followers, and together with\nsome hot charts (particularly those for the Basie band) he gives new life to these holiday\nchestnuts. The Bennett fanatic in your family may be expecting the monumental 73-CD Complete\nCollection under the tree, but the rest of the family will be satisfied by this warm collection\nof classics. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.\n\nTony Bennett's voice is amazing -- smooth, understated elegance. This is a holiday CD that wont\ndisappoint you. Almost seems a pity to listen to it only in the month of December!\n\n\n\n   1. Tony Bennett - Santa Claus Is Coming To Town            [02:54]\n   2.
