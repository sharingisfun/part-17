One ordinary sort of morning they receive a correspondence informing them that a gentleman is on his way to visit, a Mr Webster. Visitors to Larklight are rare if not unique, and a frenzy of preparation ensues. But it is entirely the wrong sort of preparation, as they discover when their guest arrives, and a Dreadful and Terrifying (and Marvellous) adventure begins. It takes them to the furthest reaches of Known Space, where they must battle the evil First Ones in a desperate attempt to save each other - and the Universe. Recounted through the eyes of Art himself, Larklight is sumptuously designed and illustrated throughout.\n\nRead by Greg Steinburner\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged\n\n-----------------------\nVisit us for more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8beb0395654faa5cf427bd762ad674acfa9777d","amp;dn":"Larklight+-+Philip+Reeve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8beb0395654faa5cf427bd762ad674acfa9777d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,190,176,57,86,84,250,165,207,66,123,215,98,173,103,74,207,169,119,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
