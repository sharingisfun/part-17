The music here all seems of a piece, despite the different selection titles and the single percussion piece on the set. The sheer momentum of the title cut, which closes the album and integrates spacious electronic soundscapes, ever deepening tonalities, found taped choral vocals whispering in the background, and percussion is one of the most provocative pieces to come from the Krautrock generation. This is an auspicious debut, which holds up wonderfully in the 21st century.\n \nThis re-release features the 10:30 mins bonus track Train Through Time.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“AffenstundeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a masterful album and even more so when one considers Fricke mastered the Moog, a brand new instrument, in under one yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time.\n\nThis is a brilliant and timeless album of innovative electronic music from one of its early masters.\n\nEssential !!\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d35208f2970b56d9b09af391bc5450a3127c8322","amp;dn":"Popol+Vuh+-+Affenstunde+1970+%2F+2004+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d35208f2970b56d9b09af391bc5450a3127c8322","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,82,8,242,151,11,86,217,176,154,243,145,188,84,80,163,18,124,131,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
