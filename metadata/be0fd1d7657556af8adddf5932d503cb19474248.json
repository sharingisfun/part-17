A vocal talent without compare, at any moment she can be garrulous, gracious, sassy, sinful, prim and proper, worldly and wise.\n\nThis CD collects the best of Sue Scott, so far, as if such a thing were possible. Here's Sue as Mom calling her beleaguered son Duane; as Ruth Harrison, Reference Librarian; with her black belt in biblio-kwon-do. As devastatingly beautiful supermodel Cynthia Maxwell. As private eye Guy Noir's faithful ex-girlfriend, Sugar. As an NPR correspondent. A waitress named Vi. A blonde. A bird. Berniece. Radio Starlet Lulu Lane, and more.\n\nHere's Sue Scott in 14 sketches, bits, and send-ups heard over the years on live broadcasts of A Prairie Home Companion. All seriously silly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be0fd1d7657556af8adddf5932d503cb19474248","amp;dn":"A+Prairie+Home+Companion+-+Sue+Scott-+Seriously+Silly+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be0fd1d7657556af8adddf5932d503cb19474248","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,15,209,215,101,117,86,175,138,221,223,89,50,213,3,203,25,71,66,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
