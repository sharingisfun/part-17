With an additional cast of pioneering chefs and some of the best cooking you have ever seen, the scientists and doctors in the film present a convincing case for the West to re-examine its love affair with meat and dairy. The film features the ground-breaking work of Dr. T Colin Campbell in China exploring the link between diet and disease, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn's use of diet to treat heart disease patients, and Professor Gidon Eshel's investigations into how our food choices impact our land, oceans and atmosphere. With the help of some innovative farmers and chefs, PLANEAT shows how the problems we face today can be solved, without simply resorting to a diet of lentils and lettuce leaves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7357fad00c97f6b70c997ea6ac0a86f17bbdf0a","amp;dn":"PlanEat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7357fad00c97f6b70c997ea6ac0a86f17bbdf0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,53,127,173,0,201,127,107,112,201,151,234,106,192,168,111,23,187,223,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
