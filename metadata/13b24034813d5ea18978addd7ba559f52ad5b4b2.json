It's not a &quot;lefty&quot;tot tome, rather a historical look at trends in once-functioning democracies from modern history that are being repeated in our country today. It gives any reader (or viewer of the lecture) a much-needed history lesson and constitutional refresher. Most importantly, it puts the recent gradual loss of civil liberties in the U.S. in a historical context. The average American might not be alarmed at AT&amp;T selling our private information to the Bush administration, but when this action is seen as part of a larger series of erosions and events, a pattern emerges with unfortunate consequences that become disturbingly clear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13b24034813d5ea18978addd7ba559f52ad5b4b2","amp;dn":"The+End+Of+America+2008+DVDRip+XviD-DOMiNO%28No+Rars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13b24034813d5ea18978addd7ba559f52ad5b4b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,178,64,52,129,61,94,161,137,120,173,221,123,165,89,245,42,213,180,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
