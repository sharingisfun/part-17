Her husband, Declan, a powerful, seductive man, provides her with new memories, but her dreams contradict his stories, showing her a past life she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe possible: memories of war, of a camp where girls are trained to be wives, of love for another man. Something inside her tells her not to speak of this, but she does not know why. She only knows she is at war with herself.\n\nSuppressing those dreams during daylight hours, Emma lets Declan mold her into a happily married woman and begins to fall in love with him. But the day Noah stands before her, the line between her reality and dreams shatters.\n\nIn a future where women are a rare commodity, Emma fights for freedom but is held captive by the love of two menÃ¢â‚¬â€one her husband, the other her worst enemy. If only she could remember which is which. . . .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:217a7d3471cc9c034b5e7a23f965bb3f02e1fda3","amp;dn":"Archetype+%28Archetype+%231%29+by+M.D.+Waters+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"217a7d3471cc9c034b5e7a23f965bb3f02e1fda3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,122,125,52,113,204,156,3,75,94,122,35,249,101,187,63,2,225,253,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
