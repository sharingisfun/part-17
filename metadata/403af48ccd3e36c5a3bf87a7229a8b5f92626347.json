After a series of EPs including Fire &amp; Brimstone, Tattoos &amp; Scally Caps, and Boys on the Docks, the Dropkick Murphys signed to Hellcat Records to issue their 1998 full-length Do or Die, produced by Rancid's Lars Frederiksen; McColgan exited the group soon after (he later went on to form the like-minded Street Dogs) and was replaced by vocalist Al Barr for the follow-up, 1999's The Gang's All Here. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t\t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tBorn &amp; Bred Records\nCatalogue #\t\tDKM2-532420\t\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.The Boys Are Back\n02.Prisoner's Song\n03.Rose Tattoo\n04.Burn\n05.Jimmy Collins' Wake\n06.The Season's Upon Us\n07.The Battle Rages On\n08.Don't Tear Us Apart\n09.My Hero\n10.Out On The Town\n11.Out Of Our Heads\n12.End Of The Night\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:403af48ccd3e36c5a3bf87a7229a8b5f92626347","amp;dn":"Dropkick+Murphys+-+Signed+And+Sealed+In+Blood+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"403af48ccd3e36c5a3bf87a7229a8b5f92626347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,58,244,140,205,62,54,197,163,191,135,167,34,154,139,95,146,98,99,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
