The author takes a human interest, Freakonomics-style approach to such economic riddles as why Islamic nations stay mired in poverty (he argues that one reason might be the Qur'an's dictum against usury and interest-earning) and why Africa is dependent on exporting raw materials rather than commercial products (soaring temperatures and shoddy infrastructure). Beattie imbues economics with wonderful mystery as he untangles the mechanisms of the blood diamond trade and Peru's curious stranglehold on the global export of asparagus. Closer to home, Beattie examines the economic rivalry between Argentina and the United States a century ago; when Argentina seemed to be winning, the U.S. made a series of crucial decisions, moved forward and left Argentina poised for financial disaster. Thorough research, eclectic examples and a sprightly tone (Puritans were not big on bling) should make this a hit among those interested in world economicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a must-read alternative for those who couldn't get through Guns, Germs and Steel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:524bd2d4b70b4f35f3e87d5235038a188d26f475","amp;dn":"Alan+Beattie+--+False+Economy+A+Surprising+Economic+History+of+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"524bd2d4b70b4f35f3e87d5235038a188d26f475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,75,210,212,183,11,79,53,243,232,125,82,53,3,138,24,141,38,244,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
