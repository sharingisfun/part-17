In the 1950s she wrote a series of social comedies, of which the best known are Excellent Women (1952) and A Glass of Blessings (1958). In 1977 her career was revived when the biographer David Cecil and the poet Philip Larkin both nominated her as the most under-rated writer of the century. Her novel Quartet in Autumn (1977) was nominated for the Booker Prize that year, and she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\n\nSeveral strong themes link the works in the Pym canon, which are more notable for their style and characterization than for their plots. A superficial reading gives the impression that they are sketches of village or suburban life, and comedies of manners, studying the social activities connected with the Anglican church (in particular the Anglo-Catholic parish.) (Pym attended several churches during her lifetime, including St Michael and All Angels, Barnes, where she served on the Parish Church Council.)\n\nHer works are deeper than that, however. She closely examines many aspects of women's and men's relations, including unrequited feelings of women for men, based on her own experience. Pym was also one of the first popular novelists to write sympathetically about unambiguously gay characters (most notably in A Glass of Blessings). She portrayed the layers of community and figures in the church seen through church functions. The dialogue is often deeply ironic. A tragic undercurrent runs through some of the later novels, especially Quartet in Autumn and The Sweet Dove Died.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, all in ePUB format:\n\n* A Few Green Leaves\n\n* A Glass of Blessings\n\n* An Suitable Attachment\n\n* Civil to Strangers\n\n* Crampton Hodnet\n\n* Excellent Women\n\n* Jane and Prudence\n\n* Less Than Angels\n\n* No Fond Return of Love\n\n* Quartet in Autumn\n\n* Some Tame Gazelle\n\n* The Sweet Dove Died\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Pym&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Pym&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.salon.com/2013/03/14/barbara_pym_gets_rediscovered_%E2%80%94_again/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.salon.com/2013/03/14/barbara_pym_gets_rediscovered_%E2%80%94_again/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barbara-pym.org/Homepage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barbara-pym.org/Homepage.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10071305/Philip-Hensher-toasts-the-novelist-Barbara-Pym.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10071305/Philip-Hensher-toasts-the-novelist-Barbara-Pym.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theawl.com/2013/05/the-first-century-of-marvelous-spinster-barbara-pym&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theawl.com/2013/05/the-first-century-of-marvelous-spinster-barbara-pym&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===================================================================================\n\nYou may also like these:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10137184/Eudora_Welty_-_Novels__Short_Stories_and_Non-fiction_(7_Books)_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10137184/Eudora_Welty_-_Novels__Short_Stories_and_Non-fiction_(7_Books)_&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10298712/Edwidge_Danticat_--_Brother__I_m_Dying__amp__Others_(9_Books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10298712/Edwidge_Danticat_--_Brother__I_m_Dying__amp__Others_(9_Books)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10337523/Tove_Jansson_-_Moomin_Books__amp__Other_Works_(15_Books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10337523/Tove_Jansson_-_Moomin_Books__amp__Other_Works_(15_Books)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9996008/Amy_Tan_-_Fictions_and_Non-Fiction_(8_Books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9996008/Amy_Tan_-_Fictions_and_Non-Fiction_(8_Books)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9967321/Muriel_Spark_-_Novels_and_Short_Stories_(18_books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9967321/Muriel_Spark_-_Novels_and_Short_Stories_(18_books)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9836075/Lorrie_Moore_-_Novels_and_Short_Stories_(7_Books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9836075/Lorrie_Moore_-_Novels_and_Short_Stories_(7_Books)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c705b0c9df89f3e2634a398e7f36b052a11abef","amp;dn":"Barbara+Pym+-++English+Novelist+%2812+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c705b0c9df89f3e2634a398e7f36b052a11abef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,112,91,12,157,248,159,62,38,52,163,152,231,243,107,5,42,17,171,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
