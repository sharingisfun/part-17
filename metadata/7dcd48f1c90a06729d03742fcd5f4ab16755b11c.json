John Constantine has escaped, cheated, narrowly avoided and even reversed death on multiple occasions over the past 25 years. Now, we will test whether the old boy has one more second chance in him. Don't miss this epic, oversized special issue celebrating everything that makes John Constantine so bloody unique.\n\nWritten by: Peter Milligan\nArt by: Giuseppe Camuncoli, Stefano Landini\nCover by: Simon Bisley\n\nColor, 48 Pages\nOn Sale: Feb 20 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dcd48f1c90a06729d03742fcd5f4ab16755b11c","amp;dn":"HELLBLAZER+300+%282013%29+%28DC+Vertigo%29+FINAL+ISSUE+%28Nahga-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dcd48f1c90a06729d03742fcd5f4ab16755b11c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,205,72,241,201,10,6,114,157,3,116,47,205,95,74,177,103,85,177,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
