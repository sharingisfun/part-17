Her studious roommate Katy is a bit of a bore, but Lily didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come to Argentina to hang out with other Americans.\n \nFive weeks later, Katy is found brutally murdered in their shared home, and Lily is the prime suspect. But who is Lily Hayes? It depends on whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s asking. As the case takes shapeÃ¢â‚¬â€revealing deceptions, secrets, and suspicious DNAÃ¢â‚¬â€Lily appears alternately sinister and guileless through the eyes of those around her: the media, her family, the man who loves her and the man who seeks her conviction. With mordant wit and keen emotional insight, Cartwheel offers a prismatic investigation of the ways we decide what to seeÃ¢â‚¬â€and to believeÃ¢â‚¬â€in one another and ourselves.\n \nJennifer duBoisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut novel, A Partial History of Lost Causes, was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Fiction and was honored by the National Book FoundationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 5 Under 35 program. In Cartwheel, duBois delivers a novel of propulsive psychological suspense and rare moral nuance. Who is Lily Hayes? What happened to her roommate? No two readers will agree. Cartwheel will keep you guessing until the final page, and its questions about how much we really know about ourselves will linger well beyond.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0f3c5f3835ada8b741feffc4befd231284a38a5","amp;dn":"Cartwheel+-+Jennifer+Dubois.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0f3c5f3835ada8b741feffc4befd231284a38a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,243,197,243,131,90,218,139,116,31,239,252,75,239,210,49,40,74,56,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
