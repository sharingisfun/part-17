The Hollies were one of the most successful British groups of the 1960s, scoring 17 consecutive, Top 20 UK singles.\n\nFrom October 1966 until Nash's departure, all their A-sides were Clarke-Hicks-Nash compositions. Beginning with 'Stop, Stop, Stop' through 'On a Carousel' and 'Carrie Anne' to the more experimental 'King Midas in Reverse', 'Jennifer Eccles' and their final single with Graham Nash, 'Listen To Me' (UK no.11), the songwriting trio crafted a series of hugely successful, imaginative pop songs, which showcased their beautiful harmonies and songwriting incredible prowess.\n\n- - -\n\nHollies - Clarke, Hicks &amp; Nash Years-\nThe Complete Hollies April 1963 - October 1968\n(6CD EMI 2011)\n\n\n     1.
