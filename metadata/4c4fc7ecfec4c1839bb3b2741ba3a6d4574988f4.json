The program starred Candice Bergen as the eponymous Murphy Brown, an investigative journalist and news anchor for FYI, a fictional CBS television newsmagazine.\n\nThe show achieved a level of political notoriety in the 1992 presidential election when Dan Quayle mentioned the show in a campaign speech, afterwards known as the &quot;Murphy Brown speech&quot;.\n\nThe show began in the Monday 9/8PM timeslot and remained there until its final season when it was moved to Wednesday at 8:30/7:30PM. The series finale aired in its original Monday timeslot.\n\nRunning gags\n\n    * The show did not have an opening theme song, but instead many episodes began with a Motown song whose lyrics were somehow relevant to the plot of the episode. The show did employ a regular closing theme.\n    * Many characters often commented that Murphy was especially difficult or grouchy due to premenstrual syndrome around the 18th of every month. (Corky Sherwood said in one episode: &quot;Circle the 18th. We all do!&quot;)\n    * Murphy's annual visits to the White House, always ending with her being kicked out.\n    * The annual fictional Humboldt awards.\n    * For a few seasons, Corky Sherwood was known as &quot;Corky Sherwood Forrest&quot; after marrying a lawyer named Will Forrest (Scott Bryce) in the show's 1989ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1990 season. Corky and Will later divorced. Faith Ford's real-life husband at this time was named Robert Nottingham.\n    * While the other news anchors produced many serious news stories, Corky's running gag was that her stories were frivolous. Examples included a retrospective on Bert Parks, where to take one's cat while one goes on vacation, and &quot;a dinner with the Van Patten family.&quot;\n    * The network regularly sent Murphy incompetent secretaries, with a different secretary in almost every episode. On one occasion, it was Carol (Marcia Wallace) from The Bob Newhart Show, who proved really good at the job but quit when Bob Hartley (Bob Newhart) showed up and begged her to come back to his office in Chicago. Other secretaries included a crash test dummy, a prostitute who operated a phone sex line from her desk, and a rapper who related all Murphy's phone messages to her in verse. In the show's final season, the secretaries were played byincluding Bette Midler, Don Rickles, Rosie O'Donnell, Sally Field, Laura Kightlinger, Cecily Adams, Paul Reubens, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Julie Brown. Over the course of the series, 93 different secretaries appeared in all. In the ninth season, Murphy learns of her former secretaries' support group, which included a Hitler look-alike, a woman who spoke with a long pause after every word and a mentally unstable man. In addition to the above list of secretaries appearing on the actual show, &quot;The Keys&quot; episode of Seinfeld featured Kramer appearing as one of Murphy's secretaries.\n    * When Murphy became a mother in season four, she went through nannies the same way she went through secretaries, and Eldin Bernecky, the house painter, ended up looking after Avery most of the time.\n    * Several noted TV journalists, including Connie Chung, Morley Safer, Paula Zahn, Faith Daniels, Katie Couric, Walter Cronkite, Larry King, Charles Kuralt, Ed Bradley, Lesley Stahl, Joan Lunden, John McLaughlin, Mike Wallace, Irving R. Levine, Linda Ellerbee, Tom Snyder, and Mary Alice Williams appeared on Murphy Brown during the course of the series. All of them played themselves and interacted with Murphy and the other FYI personnel as real peers and colleagues. Zahn, Daniels, Couric, Lunden and Williams appeared together as the guests invited to Murphy's baby shower in 1992.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4fc7ecfec4c1839bb3b2741ba3a6d4574988f4","amp;dn":"Murphy+Brown+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4fc7ecfec4c1839bb3b2741ba3a6d4574988f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,79,199,236,254,196,193,131,155,179,178,116,27,163,166,212,87,73,136,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
