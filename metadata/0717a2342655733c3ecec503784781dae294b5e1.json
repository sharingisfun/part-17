Much to his surprise, the result had nothing to do with chafing or wedgies, but rather the summoning of an evil incarnation of himself, the AntiSpank.\n\nBalance can only be restored to the world by entering the Fires of Bacon and destroying five of the thongs. Now, DeathSpank travels the lands to find a sizzling solution to vanquish the AntiSpank and bring about peace once again to Spanktopia.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Full Game Features ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Explore unique locations such as The Forbidden Zone, RainbowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s End and HellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Half Acre in a pop-up book style adventure.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Over 100 quests, challenging boss fights and mind bending puzzles to complete\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Meet a cast of crazy characters, including The Nuclear Family, Z.I.M.O.N, The retired Gods, Elvis and Mutoe the edible abomination \nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Unleash devastating attacks on the enemy with the all-powerful Weapons of Justice\nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Control the battlefield with tactical precision by using your Shield Bash, Perfect Reflect and Charged Attacks \nÃƒÂ¢Ã‹Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Play local co-op with a friend and choose from one of four amazing sidekicks\n\nMinimum Requirements \n\nOS: Mac OS X v10.6 or greater \nProcessor: Intel \nCPU Speed: 1.8 GHz \nMemory: 1.5 GB RAM \nHard Disk Space: 2 GB free disk space \nVideo Card: ATI Radeon x1900 or better / NVIDIA 8600M or better \nVideo Memory (VRAM): 128 MB or higher \n\n* To play with a controller, the controller must be active before you start the game.
