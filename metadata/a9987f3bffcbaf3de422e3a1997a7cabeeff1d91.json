It reviews recent progress in the use of SPMs on such soft materials as polymers, with a particular emphasis on chemical discrimination, mechanical properties, tip-induced reactions and manipulations, as well as their nanoscale electrical properties. Detailing the practical application potential of this hot topic, this book is of great interest to specialists of wide-ranging disciplines, including physicists, chemists, materials scientists, spectroscopy experts, surface scientists, and engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9987f3bffcbaf3de422e3a1997a7cabeeff1d91","amp;dn":"Scanning+Probe+Microscopies+Beyond+Imaging","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9987f3bffcbaf3de422e3a1997a7cabeeff1d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,152,127,59,255,203,175,61,228,34,227,161,153,122,124,171,238,255,29,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
