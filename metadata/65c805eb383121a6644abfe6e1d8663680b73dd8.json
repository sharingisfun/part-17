I don't always have time to listen live so commercials don't always get cut out and sometimes there's extra stuff at the end of the files. Leiberman Live got recorded at the end of one of the files, but it also has its separate file too. I believe the Howard Tapes are different than Sternthology but I haven't listened to either yet. Hopefully next week someone will be posting the show again and I can just do the extra stuff because I won't always have time to grab it all. Enjoy!\n\n~Phoenixxx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65c805eb383121a6644abfe6e1d8663680b73dd8","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+7-3-14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65c805eb383121a6644abfe6e1d8663680b73dd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,200,5,235,56,49,33,166,100,74,191,230,225,216,102,54,128,183,61,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
