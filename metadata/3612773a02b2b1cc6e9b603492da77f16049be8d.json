You will see these are meticulously tagged.\n\nFor the tracks that are for two players, there were two 6-channel audio files for each player: one guitar track and one DJ track. I mixed the matching 6-channel WAV files in Adobe Premiere Pro and then exported them as single 6-channel WAVs, which I then used when converting to MP3. Some tracks have 1 or 2 seconds of silence in the beginning. You can handle it, as I did not edit these songs in any way and I refuse to do so.\n\nI also found three tracks that are not in the game and are not mentioned anywhere online as being in the game. These are:\n\n* Ludacris vs. RHCP - Ludakiss (this is how the .xml tracklist file in the game referred to this track, so this is what I named it)\n\n* Aceyalone vs. unknown artist - Lost Your Mind vs. unknown song (the name &quot;Bob&quot; was used as the other artist, but that obviously wasn't sufficient to come to any conclusion about who that is)\n\n* Bliss n Eso vs. unknown artist - Party At My Place vs. unknown song (no information in the xml about this track)\n\nThis took a long-ass time, but I am a hardcore DJ Shadow fan so it was gonna be for me anyway.\n\nLastly, the entire soundtrack was mastered at 32khz. This is not a transcode, it was released lossy and therefore will look like a transcode if you don't know what you're looking for.\n\nENJOY!\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n1. 2pac vs. The Aranbee Pop Symphony Orchestra - All Eyez On Me vs. Bittersweet Symphony (4:00)\n2. 50 Cent vs. David Bowie - Disco Inferno vs. Let's Dance (3:05)\n3. 50 Cent vs. Indeep - Disco Inferno vs. Last Night A DJ Saved My Life (2:47)\n4.
