Joe Yearbook: Artist's Edition Portfolio\nPublisher:  IDW Publishing\nPublication Date:  February 2013\n\nWriter:  Larry Hama\nArt and Cover:  Michael Golden\n\nOriginally published in G.I. Joe Yearbook #2 by Marvel Comics.  From the people who bring you the Eisner Award-winning Artist's Edition series, comes the next Artist's Edition portfolio: the legendary G.I. JOE Year Book #2 by Michael Golden. The cover and all 22 interior pages are all presented here on individual pages that mimic Golden's gorgeous original art. And, remember, this is a HARDCOVER portfolio-like the Neal Adams Thrillkill and Bernie Wrightson Much Monster portfolios before it-and matches the exacting quality of all previous Artist's Editions.\n\nThanks goes to Lusiphur for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13b834acb758666f958f83205b4a3b20ca1d348","amp;dn":"Michael+Golden%27s+G.I.+Joe+Yearbook+-+Artist%27s+Edition+Portfolio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13b834acb758666f958f83205b4a3b20ca1d348","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,59,131,74,203,117,134,102,249,88,248,50,5,180,163,178,12,161,211,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
