The show was created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays. As a framing device, the main character, Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor), in the year 2030 recounts to his son and daughter the events that led to his meeting their mother, which explains the title and allows for a narration in the past tense. How I Met Your Mother's other main characters are Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan). Inspired by &quot;our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York,&quot; How I Met Your Mother is Bays' and Thomas' idea. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters, with Ted based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily based loosely on Thomas and his wife. The duo's first concept about &quot;an Enron executive who gets sentenced by the judge to go teach at an inner-city high school&quot; was discarded because neither writer wanted to research the subject. The series is produced by 20th Century Fox Television.
