It is cracked and works perfect.\n\n                             Airbus A300B4-200\n\n\n\nAfter 4 years of research and development, SimCheck is proud to present the classic Airbus A300B4-200!\n\nThe A300B4-200 was the third incarnation of the A300 after the B1 and the B2 series featuring increased fuel tank volume and a longer range. The cockpit still consisted of purely analogue instruments.\n\nThe SimCheck A300B4 package includes the -200 passenger version and the -203 cargo version in different liveries.\n\n\n\n                      FEATURES\n\n\nExternal model\nThe external model was developed with 3DSMax and contains all the latest features available in FSX. This means that model will not work properly in FS9.\nSome special features:\nBump bitmaps\nAPU door\nDetailed landing gear modeling including pneumatics leads\nGround power unit\nForward and aft stairs\nAnimated cargo loader\nAileron droop\nLow speed aileron movement properly simulated\nSpeedbrake panel extension as realistic as you have ever seen\nVirtual cockpit\nExtremely detailed texturized 3D cockpit environment for maximum immersion using 3D animated switches, handles and gear levers where appropriate whilst maintaining high frame rates.\nInstruments\nIndependent captains and first officers panel\nPID controlled autopilot and autothrottle functions\nINS navigation based on the CIVA INS\nWhere necessary we have added ultra smooth running gauges using GDI+ technology\nSystems programming based on the actual aircraft systems, in many cases independent from standard FSX implementations\nSound\nCustom made external sound package using the latest 3D mapping technology available in FSX and based on on real life recordings!\nExtensive set of cockpit sounds based on recordings made in the real aircraft and in the simulator\nSpeedbrake rumble\nGear wind sound\nSpecial features\nAs an extra user friendly option, we have added the ability for the INS to load FSX (XML-based) flightplans. This will reduce the workload in the cockpit for those who don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t like to enter individual waypoint coordinates manually\nFlight calculator: this little .NET program allows you to load passengers or cargo, calculate the initial optimum cruising level for your flight, fuel required and estimated flight time.\n\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nMinimum:\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X with SP2 or Acceleration Pack\nWindows 7, Vista or XP SP2\nMulticore Processor\n2 GB RAM\n512 MB Graphics Card\n\nAdvised::\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X with SP2 or Acceleration Pack\nWindows 7, Vista or XP SP2\nQuadcore Processor\n3 GB RAM\n1024 MB Graphics Card\n\nDownload-Size: 200 MB\nInstallation-Size: 800 MB\n\nquickstart gide.pdf:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.aerosoft2.de/downloads/a300/manual_simchecka300_quickstart_engl.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.aerosoft2.de/downloads/a300/manual_simchecka300_quickstart_engl.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\ntutorialflight.pdf: http://www.aerosoft2.de/downloads/a300/manual_simchecka300_tutorialflight_engl.pdf\n\n\nThis cracked Rip is made by NvidiaPhysX.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1b053d8d9b046efec5b4ccbccb2d131884e0a0","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Simcheck+Airbus+A300B4+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1b053d8d9b046efec5b4ccbccb2d131884e0a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,27,5,61,141,155,4,110,254,197,180,204,188,203,45,19,24,132,224,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
