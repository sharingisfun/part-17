The band featured Howie Vickers on lead vocals, Bill Henderson on lead guitar, recorder, keyboards and lead vocals (these last mostly on Grass and Wild Strawberries), Claire Lawrence on tenor saxophone, harmonica, keyboards, flute, organ, recorder and vocals, Glenn Miller on bass and vocals, and Ross Turney on drums and percussion. In 1968, the group released its first, eponymously named album on the Warner Brothers label (Warner/Seven Arts), and over the next two years created soundtrack music to three Canadian films. Grass and Wild Strawberries was one such; its lyrics were written by Canadian poet and playwright George Ryga (&quot;The Ecstasy of Rita Joe&quot;) complemented by the music of The Collectors. Howie Vickers left the group in 1969, and the remaining members of the band reconstituted themselves as Chilliwack, with Bill Henderson taking over lead vocals.\n\n\nChilliwack are a Canadian rock band that had their heyday during the 1970s and 1980s. They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly At Night&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continues to tour across Canada.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Chilliwack :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6d31f16c2be053db6047c7ab61726645feb3de","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+and+The+Collectors+-+11+Albums+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6d31f16c2be053db6047c7ab61726645feb3de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,109,49,241,108,43,224,83,219,96,71,199,171,97,114,102,69,254,179,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
