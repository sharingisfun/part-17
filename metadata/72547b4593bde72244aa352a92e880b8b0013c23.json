Trungpa Rinpoche provides a direct and experiential picture of the tantric world, explaining the importance of self-existing energy, the mandala principle, the difference between Buddhist and Hindu tantra-stressing the nontheistic foundation of Buddhism. The role of the teacher and the meaning of tantric transmission are also presented. Written for the student of Buddhism rather than the scholar, Journey without Goal demystifies the vajrayana and at the same time affirms the power and sacredness of its ancient teaching.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72547b4593bde72244aa352a92e880b8b0013c23","amp;dn":"Journey+without+Goal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72547b4593bde72244aa352a92e880b8b0013c23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,84,123,69,147,189,231,34,68,170,53,42,146,232,128,184,176,1,60,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
