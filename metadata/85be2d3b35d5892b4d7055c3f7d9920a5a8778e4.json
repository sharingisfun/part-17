All releases are made from the first generation master tape and mastered at half-speed, allowing for the finest sound quality possible. In the past, MFSL has produced cassette tapes, LPs, CDs, and even VHS releases of a few titles. In addition, each title is licensed to be mastered, manufactured, and sold within a specific time frame, and because of the limited quantities produced, the releases are highly sought after by collectors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85be2d3b35d5892b4d7055c3f7d9920a5a8778e4","amp;dn":"The+Byrds+-+Mr.+Tambourine+Man+%28MFSL%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85be2d3b35d5892b4d7055c3f7d9920a5a8778e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,190,45,59,53,213,137,43,77,112,85,195,247,217,146,10,90,135,120,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
