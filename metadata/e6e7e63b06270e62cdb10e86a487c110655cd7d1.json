It projects that 1 400 TWh of electricity per year could come from geothermal power by 2050, up from 67 TWh at present. This roadmap describes the technological, economic and non-economic barriers facing geothermal deployment, and the steps stakeholders must take to overcome them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e7e63b06270e62cdb10e86a487c110655cd7d1","amp;dn":"Technology+Roadmap+-+Geothermal+Heat+and+Power+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e7e63b06270e62cdb10e86a487c110655cd7d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,231,230,59,6,39,14,98,205,177,14,134,164,135,193,16,101,92,215,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
