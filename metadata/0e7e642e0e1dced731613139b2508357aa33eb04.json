Written primarily by Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration is a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The birthday of the United States of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Independence DayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is celebrated on July 4, the day the wording of the Declaration was approved by Congress.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7e642e0e1dced731613139b2508357aa33eb04","amp;dn":"%5BMP3%5D+Declaration+of+Independence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7e642e0e1dced731613139b2508357aa33eb04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,126,100,46,14,29,206,215,49,97,49,57,178,80,131,87,170,51,235,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
