Miraculously my family escaped ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ brothers John and Andrew crawled out of the rubble, having survived under a Morrison table-shelter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ although our neighbours in the other half of the house were killed. \n\nAfter the bombing we were billeted with a farmer and his family in the West Country, an episode that influenced Rough Cider, my book about the memories of an evacuee. \n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a00194e136c7ec96b2eca8f9a6ff55ce4253c754","amp;dn":"Peter+Lovesey+-+Peter+Diamond+Collection.%285%29+Lit%2CEpub%2CPdf%2CMobi%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a00194e136c7ec96b2eca8f9a6ff55ce4253c754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,1,148,225,54,199,236,150,178,236,168,249,166,255,85,206,66,83,199,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
