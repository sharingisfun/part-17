A clamorous cacophony of talking, whining, whistling, and howling, Pet Sematary is a quick, entertaining earful for those who don&amp;#039;t have other auditory distractions to contend with, such as a car full of talking whining, whistling, howling children. However, the melodramatic prose marries well with the acting; such is the case when one reader--whose voice bears an uncanny resemblance to Kramer&amp;#039;s from Seinfeld--tells another about the effects of the Pet Sematary: &quot;Heroin makes junkies feel good when they put it in their arms, but all the time it&amp;#039;s poisoning their mind and body--this place can be like that and don&amp;#039;t you ever forget it!&quot;\n\nDuration....02:51:51\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10543fc6c6469fe54f2912235e3713b991c1af2","amp;dn":"Pet+Semetary++%5BDramatisation%5D+-+Stephen+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10543fc6c6469fe54f2912235e3713b991c1af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,5,67,252,108,100,105,254,84,242,145,34,53,227,113,59,153,28,26,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
