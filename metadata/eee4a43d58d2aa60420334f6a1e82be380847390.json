Prepper's Guide to Natural Disasters skips the hype and hysteria of less likely, apocalyptic scenarios and helps you understand, prepare for, and survive real threats to your family and home - events that affect hundreds of thousands of people every year.\n\nThe Prepper's Guide to Natural Disasters helps you assess the real threats in your part of the country, then provides clear, detailed solutions to help you prepare for, survive and recover from the most common natural disasters, including floods, earthquakes, chemical releases, wildfires, winter storms, tornadoes, tech failures, economic collapse/civil unrest, terrorism, nuclear disasters, and pandemics.\n\nAbout the Author\nJim Nowka (knifeforums.com) has spent most of his life preparing for the unexpected, and his experiences make him well-qualified to educate the rest of us. His diverse list of survival experiences includes salvage diver, firefighter and rescue specialist, underwater investigator and body recovery diver, security advisor, and disaster relief worker.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee4a43d58d2aa60420334f6a1e82be380847390","amp;dn":"Prepper%27s+Guide+to+Surviving+Natural+Disasters+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee4a43d58d2aa60420334f6a1e82be380847390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,228,164,61,88,210,170,96,66,3,52,246,161,232,43,227,128,132,115,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
