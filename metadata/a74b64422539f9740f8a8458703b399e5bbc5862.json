Copy the 2 files in this crack folder (&quot;DDSPB3 v1.7 Patch - SoN.exe&quot; and &quot;Mono.Cecil.dll&quot;) to the installed DDSPB3 folder. Execute &quot;DDSPB3 v1.3 Patch - SoN.exe&quot; and that's it. I know this is our first release which includes a DLL but it's our first patch for a .NET program and the DLL is needed to run the patch. Both files can be deleted once the patch is applied if you so choose. Thanks for understanding.\n\nNotes: Thanks for testing, Raven. If anyone can find his duck it would be greatly appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a74b64422539f9740f8a8458703b399e5bbc5862","amp;dn":"DraftDaySports+Pro+Basketball+3+v1.7+Patch+-+Season+Disks+Enable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a74b64422539f9740f8a8458703b399e5bbc5862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,75,100,66,37,57,249,116,15,138,132,88,112,59,57,158,91,188,88,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
