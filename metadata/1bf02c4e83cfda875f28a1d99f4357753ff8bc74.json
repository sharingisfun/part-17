Some of the key locations include:\n\n\t* Pearl Harbor - this location reflects the actual location of Pearl Harbour on the island of Hawaii. The harbour is located on the South coast of the island.\n\n\t* Wake Island - Scattered island with one airfield on one insland. On another island are the millitary buildings.\n\n\t* Midway - Two islands with airports, harbours and other millitry buildings.\n\n\t* Manila - The city of Manila has a river (Pasig River) running through the northern part, with the main city to the south of the river.\n\n\t* Japan - An area of Japanese mainland with a small section of coast showing. On the coast is a large city.\n\nThis is not a flight simulator to keep track of numerous technical details of your aircraft, this is an AERIAL-COMBAT SIMULATOR !\n\nAttack on Pearl Harbor asks nothing from players in terms of control familiarity, allowing immediate and unquestioning involvement in the dog fighting rather than the subtleties of aviation. The missions themselves are equally quick and hard hitting, without requiring ten minutes of navigation.\n\n\t*** Burn or Mount ***\n\t*** Install ***\n\t*** Enjoy! ***\n\n\nTorrent for the ***No CD Fix*** can be found here &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5138589&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5138589&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf02c4e83cfda875f28a1d99f4357753ff8bc74","amp;dn":"Attack+on+Pearl+Harbor+-+PC+game+2007+-+Bin+Cue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf02c4e83cfda875f28a1d99f4357753ff8bc74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,240,44,78,131,207,218,135,95,40,161,217,159,67,87,117,63,248,188,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
