Other names include The Fellowship Foundation, National Fellowship Council, Fellowship House, The International Foundation, National Committee for Christian Leadership, International Christian Leadership, and the National Leadership Council. It is an international movement that claims to be centered on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ as the common ground across all religious and political divisions.\n\n**\n\nChecking in on a friend's brother at Ivenwald, a Washington-based fundamentalist group living communally in Arlington, Va., religion and journalism scholar Sharlet finds a sect whose members refer to Manhattan's Ground Zero as &quot;the ruins of secularism&quot;; intrigued, Sharlet accepts on a whim an invitation to stay at Ivenwald. He's shocked to find himself in the stronghold of a widespread &quot;invisible&quot; network, organized into cells much like Ivenwald, and populated by elite, politically ambitious fundamentalists; Sharlet is present when a leader tells a dozen men living there, &quot;You guys are here to learn how to rule the world.&quot; As it turns out, the Family was established in 1935 to oppose FDR's New Deal and the spread of trade unions; since then, it has organized well-attended weekly prayer meetings for members of Congress and annual National Prayer Breakfasts attended by every president since Eisenhower. Further, the Family's international reach (&quot;almost impossible to overstate&quot;) has &quot;forged relationships between the U.S. government and some of the most oppressive regimes in the world.&quot; In the years since his first encounter, Sharlet has done extensive research, and his thorough account of the Family's life and times is a chilling expose. - Copyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Anyone interested in circles of power will love this book.&quot; -- Debby Applegate, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Most Famous Man in America: The Biography of Henry Ward Beecher\n\n&quot;An astounding entrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e to a fascinating Christian network unknown to most Americans. . . .

Unequivocally: Sharlet knows what heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talking about. . . . Those who want to be un-deceived (and wildly entertained) must read this disturbing tour de force.&quot; -- Frank Schaeffer, author of Crazy For God: How I Grew Up As One Of The Elect, Helped Found The Religious Right, And Lived To Take All (Or Almost All) Of It Back\n\n&quot;Jeff Sharlet is one of the very best writers covering the politics of religion. Brilliantly reported and filled with wonderful anecdotes, THE FAMILY tells the story of an influential group that you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t previously heard of, and need to know about.&quot; -- Ken Silverstein, Washington editor of Harper's and author of The Radioactive Boy Scout\n\n&quot;Jeff Sharlet provides a fascinating account of how part of American Christianity has gone off on a dangerous tangent. It should worry everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½maybe especially those of us who understand the Gospels to be a call to help the powerless, not prop up the powerful.&quot; -- Bill McKibben, author of The End of Nature and The Bill McKibben Reader\n\n&quot;Of all the important studies of the American right, THE FAMILY is undoubtedly the most eloquent. It is also quite possibly the most terrifying.&quot; -- Thomas Frank, New York Times bestselling author of What's the Matter with Kansas?\n\n&quot;One of the most compelling and brilliantly researched exposes youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll ever readÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t read it alone at night!&quot; -- Barbara Ehrenreich, New York Times bestselling author of Nickel and Dimed and Bait and Switch\n\n&quot;This is a gripping, utterly original narrative about an influential evangelical elite that few Americans even know exists. . . .

A remarkable accomplishment in the annals of writing about religion.&quot; -- Rick Perlstein, author of Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America\n\n&quot;[Sharlet] has managed to infiltrate the most influential and secretive fundamentalist network in America, and ground his reporting in the most astute and original explanation of fundamentalism IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever read. . . .
