You wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t call it a girlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anything but gnarled with the passage of time. Rather, CervenkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice has an old-soul quality, one that harkens back to a tradition of American folk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ call it old-time music, around-the-house music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that sought to express deep commonplace emotions out of the softly sustained, clear articulation of compact, non-oblique lyrical sentiment.\n\n\n\nMusically, this album, like 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s solo effort ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomewhere Gone,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a departure from the bold, imaginative roots punk of X and CervenkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s other bands Auntie Christ and Original Sinners. Even the fun-loving country stomp of the Knitters is squirrelly compared to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaybe.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Fellow Knitter and world-class guitar mensch Dave Alvin appears here, on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlready in LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Lyric-wise, the album shares themes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ aching despair, domestic romance ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with her other bands. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a world of driving rain, jukeboxes, barkeeps poised to kick everybody out for the night, empty highways and burnished vistas.\n\nThroughout, Cervenka accompanies herself on acoustic guitar, with bassist Christian McBride and backing vocalist Cindy Wasserman deftly layered in arrangements that occasionally include strings, horns and piano to great effect. Catchy and immensely singable, the endless vocal refrains on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Excitement of MaybeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t going to leave your brain anytime soon.\n\ncd riped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/25/exene-cervenka/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/25/exene-cervenka/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33595749328627fb52b6999a558d5fd00bde6ac8","amp;dn":"Exene+Cervenka...The+Excitement+of+Maybe%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33595749328627fb52b6999a558d5fd00bde6ac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,89,87,73,50,134,39,251,82,182,153,154,85,141,95,208,11,222,106,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
