The physical differences are readily apparent of course, but \narguably the most important of the many differences is the malleability of the \nchildÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foot and leg, and the potential for influencing its structure and function \nin the long-term. This is a potential that must not be taken lightly.\n\nWhile there is opportunity to do good, there is also the potential to do \ngreat harm and it must be said that, at present, we understand much less than \nwe would like about the long-term influences of foot and lower limb function \non growth and development. The foot and leg in childhood pose unique challenges to the clinician, and the complexity of this patient group makes this a testing field in which to practice. Childhood disorders of the foot and lower limb is a concise but comprehensive clinical handbook covering the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity pathologies in the paediatric population. With a strong emphasis on an evidenced-based and practical approach to the subject, the reader will find the well-illustrated text concise, up-to-date and thorough in its coverage of all major aspects of foot and lower limb disorders in children. This unique book is an excellent learning resource suitable for students and health care providers in the fields of pediatrics, orthopedics, neurology, podiatry, physiotherapy, orthotics, nursing and other foot care professionals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d049678fe6b7e75bfd2ae5359274216d1cc3a4","amp;dn":"Childhood+Disorders+of+the+Foot+and+Lower+Limb+%28Nova%29+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d049678fe6b7e75bfd2ae5359274216d1cc3a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,208,73,103,143,230,183,231,91,253,42,229,53,146,116,33,109,28,195,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
