Since launching his solo career six years ago, Benevento has co-founded the label that releases his music, The Royal Potato Family, and built the studio, Fred Short Sound, where he works whenever he s not on the road. He s written, arranged and played his largely instrumental anthems, leading a band from behind his customized piano and a tiny armada of drum-machines and sequencers, keyboards and pedals. But until Benevento set out to complete his fifth solo album, he d never sung his own songs, a strange omission for music that s so often been lyrical. That changes decisively, assuredly, triumphantly on Swift, the boldest and most bracing album of Benevento s career","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e51b2ced89b41c04dc457ab8f98cb850758adc4b","amp;dn":"Marco+Benevento+-+Swift+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e51b2ced89b41c04dc457ab8f98cb850758adc4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,27,44,237,137,180,28,4,220,69,122,184,249,140,184,80,117,138,220,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
