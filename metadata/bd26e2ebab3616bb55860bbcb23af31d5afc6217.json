Despite working at the Institute of Theory and Research in Mumbai as the lowly personal assistant to a brilliant but insufferable astronomer, he dreams of more for himself and his family.\n\nEver wily and ambitious, Ayyan weaves two plots: the first to cheer up his weary, soap-opera-addicted wife by creating outrageous fictions around their ten-year-old son; the other to sabotage the married director by using his bossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seeming romance with the instituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first femaleÃ¢â‚¬â€and very attractiveÃ¢â‚¬â€researcher. \n\nMeanwhile, as the instituteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Brahmins wage a vicious war over theories about alien life, Ayyan sees his deceptions intertwining and setting in motion a series of extraordinary events he cannot stop. Unfailingly funny and irreverent, Serious Men is at once a hilarious portrayal of runaway egos and ambitions and a moving portrait of love and its strange workings.\n\nGenre: General Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd26e2ebab3616bb55860bbcb23af31d5afc6217","amp;dn":"Serious+Men+by+Manu+Joseph","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd26e2ebab3616bb55860bbcb23af31d5afc6217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,38,226,235,171,54,22,187,85,134,11,188,178,58,243,29,90,252,98,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
