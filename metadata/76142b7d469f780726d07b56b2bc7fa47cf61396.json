And &quot;reading is seeing more than you've ever imagined when in the masterful hands of acclaimed author Diana Wynne Jones. Here are seven tales -- seven doorways to bizarre, yet strangely familiar worlds -- to transport one and all. In these worlds are a child born to an ordered society but preordained to spread Dissolution...a girl who so loves the sun that she renounces her humanity for eternity...a cat and a boy, held captive by an evil magician until they can find a bigger magic of their own...a woman imprisoned in a strange country dominated by three ravenous wolves...and many other characters and stories just as exceptional. These richly drawn, razor-sharp stories showcase the skills and sheer narrative power of one of the most esteemed fantasy writers of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76142b7d469f780726d07b56b2bc7fa47cf61396","amp;dn":"Believing+is+Seeing+-+Diana+Wynne+Jones.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76142b7d469f780726d07b56b2bc7fa47cf61396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,20,43,125,70,159,120,7,38,208,123,86,178,188,127,164,124,246,19,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
