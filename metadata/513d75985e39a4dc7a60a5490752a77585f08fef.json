His distinctive style refers to the Jewish theatre and cabaret song of the Twenties and early Thirties just as to the renaissance of the Yiddish 'Schlager' ofn the Fifties, and after all his art has that brightness you will not find while searching it. He is accompanied by Trio SCHO (Gennadi Dessiatnik, violin, backing vocals; Valeri Khoryshman, accordion; Michael Jach, double bass and guest musician Jan Hermerschmidt on clarinet.\n\nPerforming on stage since 1982, Troyke had earlier worked as a gardener and with mentally handicapped children. He studied singing (with Leonore Gendries) as well as drama and speaking, and in 1990 he gave up his work to dedicate himself completely to musical performance and theater. Troyke participated in radio plays, worked as a voice actor (dubbing), and participated in various stage plays.\n\nAs a singer, his album Yiddish Anders (1992) received the praise of German record critics. Jidische Vergessene Lieder (1997) contained previously unpublished songs of Sara Bialas Tenenberg, who became his mentor for the Yiddish language.\n\nIn his performances Troyke often works with Bettina Wegner, Suzanna and the Trio Scho. His interpretations of the songs of Georg Kreisler received mention in the writer/musician's 2005 biography. In 2006 two documentaries, Yiddish Soul and Concert Yiddish Soul, featured Troyke and other performers of Yiddish music.\n\nKarsten's homepage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.karsten-troyke.de/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.karsten-troyke.de/&lt;/a&gt;\nWiki 'bout him: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsten_Troyke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsten_Troyke&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracklist:\n    * 1.
