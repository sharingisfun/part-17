Kratos fights his way through the city of Marathon and witnesses the black fog of the Olympian Morpheus which now covers the land in darkness. Kratos also hears a haunting flute melody which he eventually recognizes as a song once played by his now deceased daughter Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is tasked by the goddess Athena to find the missing sun god as in the absence of light, Morpheus has caused the remaining gods to fall into a deep slumber. Kratos eventually locates Eos (the sister of Helios) who advises that the Titan Atlas, has abducted her brother. Kratos retrieves the Primordial Fires needed to awaken the fire steeds of Helios, who take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two encounters with Charon at the River Styx. Although Charon initially defeats Kratos and banishes him to Tartarus, Kratos returns and destroys Charon.\n\nEventually locating the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos is given a choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power to be reunited with his daughter, but discovers Persephone is bitter at being betrayed by Zeus and being forced to remain in the underworld with her husband Hades. While Kratos was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy forcing the Titan to now hold the weight of the world on his shoulders. Kratos battles Persephone to the death. Although Kratos is victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that they will meet again. Riding Helios' chariot back into the sky and seeing the return of the sun, Kratos then loses consciousness from the exertion and plummets to the ground. Kratos, however, is saved by Athena and Helios, who then return to Olympus.\n\n\n\n\n\n+ enjoy ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* GLOBE FILES 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ab5885fe83f46a861b27df23fdffa8382dbbb0d","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D+GOD+OF+WAR+-+CHAINS+OF+OLYMPUS+GLOBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ab5885fe83f46a861b27df23fdffa8382dbbb0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,181,136,95,232,63,70,168,97,178,125,242,63,223,250,131,130,219,187,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
