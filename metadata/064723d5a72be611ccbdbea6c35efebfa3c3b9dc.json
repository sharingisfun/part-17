Written in his honor, the invited and refereed articles in this volume contain important new results as well as surveys in some of these areas, clearly demonstrating the impact of Duistermaat's research and, in addition, exhibiting interrelationships among many of the topics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064723d5a72be611ccbdbea6c35efebfa3c3b9dc","amp;dn":"Geometric+Aspects+of+Analysis+and+Mechanics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064723d5a72be611ccbdbea6c35efebfa3c3b9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,71,35,213,167,43,230,17,204,189,190,166,195,94,254,191,163,195,185,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
