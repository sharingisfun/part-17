After lying low for a while, My Friend the Chocolate Cake has returned to the live scene with the same frustrating but refreshing ability to defy neat, journalistic pigeonholing. The cosy confines of the Continental Cafe, borne to Melbotirne's most self-consciously grOovY set of over-25s, was an appropriate venue to hear the six-piece group as it gears up for the release of album number two, &quot;Brood&quot; in a fortnight. My Friend the Chocolate Cake's recipe for 'Brood' is apparently much richer and darker than that for its earlier work; this was reflected on Saturday night with the delivery of several new moodier tracks that struck a cool and ambient tone to the evening. Frontman David Bridle was in a relaxed mode from the opening. He seems to approach matters with the simple attitude that if the band really enjoys playing something, then the audience most probably enjoy hearing it, too. Which they did. This meant that the gang wasn't afraid to throw in the odd cover or two, as well as the regular combination of new material and some perkier, more upbeat tracks from My Friend the Chocolate Cake's younger days.'Throwing It Away', the group's current release, showed they have maintained a sharp political bent. Bridie's cohort from Not Drowning, Waving, Helen Mountfort shone on the cello, while violinist Hope Csturos engaged in some clever instrumental theatrics with Bridie, and new drummer Michael Barker, meshed well. Csturos was a particular highlight. My Friend the Chocolate Cake's performance had far too much sophistication and edge to be labelled as mere mood music, yet it managed to send one home at the end of the show in exactly the right mood. --- Darrin Farrant - The Age, June 1994","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d0e8581e8bac3920a337c2f6a20ce9ef0a29d53","amp;dn":"My+Friend+the+Chocolate+Cake+-+Brood%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d0e8581e8bac3920a337c2f6a20ce9ef0a29d53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,14,133,129,232,186,195,146,10,51,124,47,106,32,206,158,240,162,157,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
