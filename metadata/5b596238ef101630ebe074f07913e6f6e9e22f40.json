Her family operates one of the oldest African-American farms in the region (her father, a former sharecropper, bought the land around 1915.). The farm produces fruits and vegetables and specializes in growing Georgia Bells and Elberta peaches which are sold at an old fashioned roadside stand.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nVisits from Aunt Vestula\r\nA Corn-Shucking Supper\r\nStarlight and Copper\r\nHog-Killing Time\r\nMaking Molasses\r\nPicking Peaches\r\nWild Spring Greens\r\nThe Farm Stand Recipe Swap\r\nWild Honey in Springtime\r\nThe Big Eat\r\nBox Suppers\r\nSilver Teas\r\nMiss Hattieâ€™s Hurricane Survival Fireplace Dinner\r\nFamily Reunions\r\nCooking for Northerners\r\nUnexpected Company\r\nCuring Sweet Potatoes\r\nIndex\r\nSpecial Preview of Dori Sanders' novel Clover\r\n \nhttps://s33.postimg.org/gflhn8gb3/Dori_Sanders_Country_Cooking.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b596238ef101630ebe074f07913e6f6e9e22f40","amp;dn":"Dori+Sanders%27+Country+Cooking+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b596238ef101630ebe074f07913e6f6e9e22f40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,89,98,56,239,16,22,48,235,224,116,240,121,19,230,246,233,226,47,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
