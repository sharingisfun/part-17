His arrogance, remarkable talent, and unconventional lifestyle often brought him into conflict with others in the industry, and even earned him the scorn and condemnation of the public.\n\nSneaking with cousin Jimmy Lee to check out the dancing people at the Chocolate Bar, Jerry Lee, for the first time hears the piano, playing in a style he soon learns to play. Now living with his cousin J.W., he meets 13 year old Myra and they soon fall for each other. Now Jerry Lee is a rock star and decides to marry his cousin, which started his down fall. The question is will he make it, or will his young wife and his stubborn pride keep him from being the killer himself?\n\n\nTechnical Details:\nDivX 3 Low-Motion, MP3 Audio\n\nAspect Ratio: 592x320 (1.850)\n\n23.976 Fps.\n\nLen. 1h46m00s ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66847eff3d02112eb3a651ff0eabd25d59d7386b","amp;dn":"GREAT+BALLS+OF+FIRE+DVDRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66847eff3d02112eb3a651ff0eabd25d59d7386b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,132,126,255,61,2,17,46,179,166,81,255,14,171,210,93,89,215,56,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
