The original prototype Ã¢â‚¬â€œ developed in just 48 hours at\nthe 2013 Global Game Jam in  January  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ  challenged players to complete a heart transplant, armed only\nwith an arsenal of clumsy and  inappropriate  tools and a hand that was diabolically difficult to\ncontrol, using a combination of keyboard and mouse actions.  The full Steam version comes with\nadditional features, operations and environments. From carrying out terrifying transplants in theatre\nto surgical procedures in the back of an ambulance, Surgeon Simulator 2013 now takes \noperating to the next level.\n\nNotes:\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game\n3- Copy the crack from PROPHET dir\n4- Go To Hell!\n\nChooes your language in the game menu. This release\nincludes all the updates released so far.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb3105116cf3c49cd616b43ccfc083af4f900b4","amp;dn":"Surgeon.Simulator.2013.MULTi13-PROPHET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb3105116cf3c49cd616b43ccfc083af4f900b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,179,16,81,22,207,60,73,205,97,107,67,204,252,8,58,244,249,0,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
