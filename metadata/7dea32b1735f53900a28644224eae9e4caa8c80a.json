The first model came out in 1987 followed one year later by a CD extension that made the PC-Engine the first console to have CD games.\n\nThis was quite an impressive machine, with good graphic capacities (16-bit video processor, 512 colors, 64 sprites) and a fast and powerful 8-bit CPU. It also had a very good game collection, with unique and high quality games. And even today some PC-Engine games are still without an equivalent on modern consoles. Of course if you only enjoy 3-D games, well, the PC-Engine may disappoint you a bit, but if you love good old 2-D games, especially shoot'em up, give it a try, it really has some excellent games!\n\nBut we are sure that you already know all that.\n\nGo find those PC-Engine CD-ROMs that you stored in a cupboard a few years ago, remove the dust on them, and go downloading MagicEngine!\n\nAnd don't forget to register after...\n\nMagicEngine emulates the PC-Engine almost perfectly. The emulator has:\n\n    * full HuCard emulation!\n    * full SuperGrafx emulation!\n    * full CD-ROM and Super CD-ROM emulation!\n      (with a custom System Card - no BIOS ROM needed)\n    * full Arcade Card emulation!\n    * very accurate and fast emulation!\n    * game save/load feature!\n    * nice and easy to use graphical user interface!\n    * five players mode - fully configurable!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis latest version of MagicEngine has been out for quite awhile as of the date that I'm putting this torrent up, but finding a registered copy online has been a pain in the butt... Until now, at least :)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dea32b1735f53900a28644224eae9e4caa8c80a","amp;dn":"MagicEngine+v1.1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dea32b1735f53900a28644224eae9e4caa8c80a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,234,50,177,115,95,83,144,10,40,100,66,36,234,233,228,202,168,200,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
