Despite having the hit single &quot;I'm Every Woman,&quot; Chaka was often a stilted and unfocused affair. Naughty presents the two in a more centered working relationship. The big hit here, &quot;Papillion (a.k.a- Hot Butterfly),&quot; projects an effortlessness that didn't come as easy during Khan's concurrent run with Rufus. The tough, Latinized rock/funk of &quot;Too Much Love&quot; has one of Khan's most visceral performances. For Naughty Khan also does one of the better versions of Aaron Schroeder and Jerry Ragovoy's &quot;Move Me No Mountain&quot; that's made even better by Anthony Jackson's steady bass and Steve Ferrone's tough drumming. Despite the high points, other songs like &quot;What You Did,&quot; &quot;Our Love's in Danger,&quot; and even Ashford &amp; Simpson's &quot;Clouds&quot; come off underdone. Recorded at Atlantic Studios in New York, most of Naughty represents Khan in a holding pattern, without much material to accommodate her widening range. That being said, Naughty is only a few songs away from being a bona fide classic.&quot;\n \nTRACKLIST\n\nNaughty (1980)\n==============\n01. Clouds \n02. Get Ready, Get Set\n03.
