The score eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '&quot;radio scoring&quot;, musical cues which typically lasted between five and fifteen seconds to bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. \n\n01 - Prelude\n02 - Rain\n03 - Litany\n04 - Manuscript Reading And Snow Picture\n05 - Mothers Scaifice\n06 - Charles Meets Thatcher\n07 - Galop\n08 - Dissolve\n09 - Second Manuscript\n10 - Thanks\n11 - Bernsteins Narration\n12 - Kanes New Office\n13 - Hornpipe Polka\n14 - Carters Exit\n15 - Chronicle Scherzo\n16 - Bernsteins Presto\n17 - Kanes Return\n18 - Valse Presentation\n19 - Sunset Narration\n20 - Theme And Variations\n21 - Kane And Susan\n22 - Susans Room\n23 - Mother Memory\n24 - The Trip\n25 - Gettys Departure\n26 - Kane Marries\n27 - Salaambos Aria\n28 - Lelands Dismissal\n29 - New Dawn Music\n30 - Xanadu\n31 - Jigsaws\n32 - Second Xanadu\n33 - Kanes Picnic\n34 - Susan Leaves\n35 - El Rancho\n36 - The Glass Ball\n37 - Finale\n38 - The Night\n39 - Xanadu Music\n40 - Dawn\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccb6df0d25921a77a79431cca7d45794b3980a3d","amp;dn":"Citizen+Kane+%281941%29+Original+Soundtrack+-+Bernard+Herrmann","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccb6df0d25921a77a79431cca7d45794b3980a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,182,223,13,37,146,26,119,167,148,49,204,167,212,87,148,179,152,10,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
