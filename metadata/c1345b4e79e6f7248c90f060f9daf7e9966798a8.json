They found drummer BjÃƒÂ¸rn Tore and recorded a three song demo; &quot;The lingering animosity&quot;. After a long search they found a second guitarist in Morten Nielsen. With the line up complete they started playing live and amongst other things reached second place in the Norwegian Wacken metal battle finals.\n\nNow the Aspherium debut album is completed, and it is for sale at our homepage, and itunes, amazon, we are currently continuing to play live and working on more new material.\n\nWe love music. We love it so much that we want to create our own music, exactly how we want to hear it. For the most part it's pretty heavy and brutal. Sometimes it's really epic, other times it's quiet and contemplative. We like to play fast, but we also like to play slooow.\n\nWe want our music to tell a story. We are big science fiction nerds, so we have quite a lot of inspiration from books, movies and video games in that genre. Examples: Stargate, Blade Runner, Deus Ex, 1984, The Halo Universe, Mass Effect, all the amazing books by Greg Bear.\n\nOur first album &quot;The Veil of serenity&quot; is not very science fiction focused. It focuses on things going wrong with the world in a not too distant future. We are destroying our own planet with war and pollution, and more and more people are killing each other every day.\n\nAll this goes on while most people live their daily lives and are too busy earning money to satisfy materialistic needs to notice what's going on. They are happy in their little convenient bubble where everything is fine and dandy.\n\nThis is &quot;The Veil of Serenity&quot;.\n\nPeople take notice of the real world when the Veil falls, and the world shows it's true face. Nuclear war is imminent, natural disasters are ravaging the planet. This is going to get worse before it gets better.\n\nA man sits in quiet solitude and thinks that this end is only a new beginning. We must learn from our mistakes and not let this happen again. Build a new and better world.\n\nOur next album will be more science fiction-y, and will have more of a story you can follow through the songs from beginning to end, whereas &quot;The Veil of Serenity&quot; tells more the general story of everything at different places in the world, with a lot interpretation left to the listener.\n\nThe Journey is a lie!\n\n01.
