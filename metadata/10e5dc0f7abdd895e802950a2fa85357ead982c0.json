The contributors discuss, among aothers, the period at the end of the nineteenth century, with the exploration of medical discourses linked to the appearance of the cinema; the archaeological approach to voyeurism, which would become one of the recurrent concepts of cinematographic studies; the introduction of audiovisual technologies in contemporary theatre and the ways in which they have affected the actor's body.\n\nPublisher: Amsterdam University Press (1 July 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9089640835\nISBN-13: 978-9089640833","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10e5dc0f7abdd895e802950a2fa85357ead982c0","amp;dn":"%5BFCinema+Beyond+Film+Media+Epistemology+in+the+Modern+Era%28pdf%29%7BZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10e5dc0f7abdd895e802950a2fa85357ead982c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,229,220,15,122,189,216,149,232,2,149,10,47,168,83,87,234,217,130,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
