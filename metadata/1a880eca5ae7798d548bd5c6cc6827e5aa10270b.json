However, while their conceptual flexibility makes them enormously useful, it also makes them hard to understand. In the 12 essays collected in this volume, contributors shed new light on various aspects of the law governing constructive and resulting trusts, revisiting current controversies, bringing new historical material to the fore, and offering new theoretical perspectives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a880eca5ae7798d548bd5c6cc6827e5aa10270b","amp;dn":"Constructive+and+Resulting+Trusts-+Mitchell+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a880eca5ae7798d548bd5c6cc6827e5aa10270b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,136,14,202,90,231,121,141,84,139,213,198,204,104,39,229,170,16,39,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
