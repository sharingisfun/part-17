Edwards, Jr., was instructed to visit every major ground unit in the country. Go to Special Forces camps, ground reconnaissance units, armored cavalry units, and waterborne reconnaissance units. Search everywhere for intelligence sources' long range patrols, boats, electronic surveillance, and agent operations. Don't get bogged down by dog-and-pony shows staged for colonels and generals.\n\nThis audiobook is built around Fred Edward's journals, sent home during his first tour in Vietnam in 1966-67. His own meticulous research fits his individual experiences into a larger context, through Postscripts, extensive notes, and a thorough historical chronology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68333fa5aad80cd104068299cff5373d86bf5b29","amp;dn":"The+Bridges+of+Vietnam%3A+From+the+Journals+of+a+U.+S.+Marine+Inte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68333fa5aad80cd104068299cff5373d86bf5b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,51,63,165,170,216,12,209,4,6,130,153,207,245,55,61,134,191,91,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
