For Prepar3d, you must have version 3.3 or 3.3.5 installed as this will only work in those versions of P3D.   I've personally tested this in P3D 3.3.5.   \r\n\r\nAll credit to the original uploader from 'elsewhere'.     Not my work!\r\n\r\nThis torrent is dedicated to the Flight Simming communities' biggest dick and asshole, Mr. Colin Pearson of Milviz.  God I hate you, you son of a bitch.   Look for lots of the latest release Milviz products here at the TPB in the coming days.     :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb96891f3f957ed9791b7c8192d5bf502b1e81a","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Milviz+F-4E+Phantom+II+v1.60306+%28June+7%2C+2016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb96891f3f957ed9791b7c8192d5bf502b1e81a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,185,104,145,243,249,87,237,151,145,183,200,25,45,91,245,2,177,232,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
