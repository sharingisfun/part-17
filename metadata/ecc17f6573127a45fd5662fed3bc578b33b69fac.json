The two music videos in the &quot;extras&quot; do not have subtitles, but the documentary does.\n\nHere are some descriptions I found on various sites:\n\nVeteran jazz pianist Ramon Valdes (aka Bebo) and upstart flamenco vocalist Diego Salazar (who goes by the stage name El Cigala) became an unexpected sensation in Europe after the release of their first collaborative album in 2003, and this performance video captures these singular musicians on stage. Bebo and Cigala en Vivo documents the duo's trademark blend of jazz and traditional Latin sounds in a Spanish concert hall, accompanied by Nino Josele on guitar, Israel &quot;Pirana&quot; Porrina on percussion, and Javier Colina on bass.\n\nIn 2003, the venerable Afro-Cuban pianist Ramon &quot;Bebo&quot; ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s teamed with the modern Spanish flamenco singer Diego &quot;El Cigala&quot; Salazar for an incredible fusion of pan-Latin styles on their Grammy Award-winning album LÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½GRIMAS NEGRAS. Directed by Spanish director Fernando Trueba (BELLE EPOQUE, CALLE 54), BLANCO Y NEGRO EN VIVO presents a visual companion to LÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½GRIMAS NEGRAS with a 19-song live performance recorded in Mallorca in June 2003, as well as a behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the album.\n\nBebo ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, 84 years old, becomes platinum album with his collaboration with flamenco singer, Diego el Cigala. This double DVD contains all their music in images. DVD 1, tittled 'Black and white' is a live recording filmed in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) in the summer of 2003. DVD2 contains a documentary by film director Fernando Trueba, containing all the rehearsals and first contacts for the making of the album 'LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡grimas negras'\n\n\nDiego el Cigala\n\nHe was born Diego Jimenez Salazar in Madrid in 1968, but, one day, CamarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n gave him the name of Dieguito &quot;El Cigala&quot; (the crawfish). Diego comes from a family of artists, including his uncle Rafael Farina. He grew up in the area of the Madrid flea market, which was the scene of his first childhood engagements as a singer.\n\nAt twelve years of age, he won his first award in the flamenco competition of a town near Madrid, and another award in a television contest called &quot;Gente Joven&quot;.\n\nDiego started off singing as a dance accompanist. Famous dancers such as CristÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³bal Reyes, Mario Maya, Manolete, Farruco, Manuel Camacho, and el GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ito sought him out, musicians such as Tomatito and Vicente Amigo hired him for studio recordings, and in 1994 he began his solo career, accompanied by the guitarists Anton JimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nez, David Amaya, Paquete, and Tomatito. Following the publication of his second recording &quot;Entre vareta y Canasta&quot;, his habitual guitarist has been el NiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o Josele. In 2000 the cantaor Juanito Valderrama proclaimed Dieguito to be one of the most promising young voices.\n\n\nRamon Valdes (a.k.a. Bebo)\nFrom Wikipedia:\nBebo ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s (born RamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n Emilio ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s Amaro in QuivicÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n, Havana, 9 October 1918) is a Cuban pianist, bandleader, composer and arranger. He was a central figure in the golden age of Cuban music, led two famous big bands, and was one of the 'house' arrangers for the Tropicana Club.\n\nValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s started his career as a pianist in the night clubs of Havana during the 1940s. From 1948 to 1957 he worked as pianist and arranger for the vedette Rita Montaner, who was the lead act in the Tropicana cabaret. His orchestra Sabor de Cuba, and that of Armando ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, alternated at the Tropicana backing singers such as Benny More and Pio Leyva. ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s played a role in the development of the mambo during the 1950s, and developed a new rhythm to compete with Perez Prado's mambo, called the batanga. ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s was also an important figure in Cuban jazz and taking part in the Panart Cuban jazz sessions (one was commissioned by American producer Norman Granz). In the late 1950s he recorded with Nat 'King' Cole.\n\nIn 1960, with his singer Rolando La Serie, Bebo left Cuba for Mexico. He then lived briefly in the United States before touring Europe, and eventually settled in Stockholm, where he lived until 2007. In Sweden he was instrumental in spreading the techniques of Cuban music and latin jazz.\n\nIn 1994 a CD, Bebo rides again, revived his career. The film Calle 54 by Fernando Trueba brought his piano playing to a wide audience. In 2004 he was again filmed by Trueba, in El milagro de Candeal, in Brazil. ValdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s has won five Grammy Awards: two for El arte del sabor in 2002, one for Lagrimas negras, and two for Bebo de Cuba in 2006 (in the categories Best traditional tropical album and Best Latin jazz album).\n\nHis many compositions included Guempa, DaquirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­, Dile a Catalina, Nocturno en batanga, La rareza del siglo, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©xico querido and Ritmando el chachacha.\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecc17f6573127a45fd5662fed3bc578b33b69fac","amp;dn":"Blanco+Y+Negro+-+Bebo+%26+Cigala+en+Vivo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecc17f6573127a45fd5662fed3bc578b33b69fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,193,127,101,115,18,122,69,253,86,98,254,211,188,87,139,51,182,159,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
