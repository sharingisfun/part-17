This is the 2006 remastered version on Rock Candy.\n\nWHEN DEEP PURPLE finally collapsed under a blanket of fatigue and insurrection in mid-1976, all bets were off as to which members would fly phoenix-like from the wreckage.\n\nFully loaded with talent, Purple was a breeding ground for a significant amount of lofty and successful spin-off projects, including Whitesnake, Rainbow and Gillan. But it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until 1982, following a couple of low-key solo projects, that bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes would resurface with a unit that would (quite rightly) stop the rock world in its tracksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nTeaming up with highly respected guitarist Pat Thrall (previously a member of jazz fusionists Automatic Man and the whiskey-snortinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Pat Travers Band), the duo joined forces and names under the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hughes/ThrallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ banner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an early-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s collaboration that would go on to deliver an album that has seen its  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“legendary/all-time greatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ status increase by leaps &amp; bounds as the years have rolled by.\n\nFull-bloodedly produced by the seasoned (and equally legendary) Andy Johns, a sometimes gun-totinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Brit whose credits also include Free, Led Zeppelin &amp; Van Halen, the record received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic reception on release, basking in clear-cut melodies, razor-sharp guitar chops, edgy production and some of the best songs this side of a Journey or Foreigner album. The icing on the cake? Why, Glenn Hughes, of course. The voice of rock has never sounded so downright confident and so well-matched to the material. Every song, every phrase, every lick ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pure manna from hard rock heaven!\n\n1. I Got Your Number\n2. Look in Your Eye\n3. Beg, Borrow or Steal\n4. Where Did the Time Go\n5.
