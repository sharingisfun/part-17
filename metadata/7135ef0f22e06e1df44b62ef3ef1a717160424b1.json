Learn how the animation storyboard differs from live action boards and how characters must be developed simultaneously with the story. Positive and negative examples of storyboard and character design are presented and analyzed to demonstrate successful problem-solving techniques. Artwork from an international array of students and professionals supplement the author's own illustrations. Three never-before-published interviews with well known development artists and a comprehensive glossary are also included.\n\nPublisher: Focal Press; 1st edition (March 2, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0240808207\nISBN-13: 978-0240808208\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n'Nancy Beiman has done an excellent job explaining the story development and boarding process, and I am certain this book will be a useful tool to all animation students and schools.'\nBrian P. McEntee, Art Director 'Beauty and the Beast' and Production Designer 'Ice Age'\n\n'No one knows more about designing characters and creating story for animation than Nancy Beiman. Lavishly illustrated and expertly written, she draws on all her experience as a teacher, an artist and an animation industry veteran. A must-have for anyone who wants to make an animated film.'\nJerry Beck, Animation Historian, www.cartoonbrew.com\n\n'In the library of motion picture how/to books, one topic that has not been adequately explained is the art of storyboarding. Internationally known animator Nancy Beiman draws upon her experience to create for the first time a definitive manual for the art. Lavishly illustrated and highly readable, it is essential reading for anyone serious about learning how to create stories, characters and storyboards for film.'\nTom Sito, animator, author of Drawing the Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson.\n\n'At long last we have a comprehensive new book covering the not always fully-understood areas of the animated film production processes of story and character development, and their care and feeding. Nancy Beiman, a seasoned Producer, Writer, Teacher, Story Artist, and former Disney Animator who has worked all over the globe, has authored a book which I predict will become a textbook in animation programs everywhere.'\nBill Matthews\nAnimation Professor\n\n'Nancy Beiman knows that storyboards are about more than continuity and cutting; they're about character and conflict. A good storyboard has the power to make things as elusive as thoughts and emotions tangible for audiences. Prepare To Board fulfills the promise of its title by supplying readers with solid advice and illustrated examples that will help them make successful animated films.'\n\nMark Mayerson, Professor of Animation, Sheridan College\n\n'Nancy Beiman has written an excellent book on\nanimation...Beiman is a natural for writing about storyboarding.'\n\nAWN.com\n\n&quot;The author has a breezy, anecdote-packed style that makes reading about the craft a real pleasure.
