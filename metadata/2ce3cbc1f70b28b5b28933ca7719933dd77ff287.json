The programme follows the evolution, presents the characters of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œberdesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and introduces to us the craftsmen who marked the history of the modern greek shadows theater. History and tradition get tangled with extracts from contemporary theater performances and the figures of Karagiozis obtain life and shape in the hands of children.\nKaragiozis is a poor hunchbacked Greek, his right hand is always depicted long, his clothes are ragged and patched, and his feet are always bare. He lives in a poor cottage (Greek: Ãƒï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â±Ãƒï¿½Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â³ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â±) with his wife Aglaia and his three sons, during the times of the Ottoman Empire. The scene is occupied by his cottage in the left, and the Sultan's Palace (Sarayi) on the far right.\nBecause of his poverty, Karagiozis uses mischievous and crude ways to find money and feed his family.\nStudents of folklore divide Karagiozis' tales in two major categories: the 'Heroics' and the 'Comedies'. The Heroics are tales based on tradition or real stories involving the times under Ottoman rule, and Karagiozis is presented as a helper and assistant of an important hero.\n\nEYGENIOS SPATHARIS\nSpatharis was born Jan. 3, 1924, and followed his puppet master father, Sotirios Spatharis, into the craft.\nFrom his first performance in 1942, he worked until the end of his life, most often as a solitary performer manipulating his puppets behind a small semitransparent screen.\nHe also collaborated with theatre and dance companies to expand the art form. He recorded 15 stories starting in the 1960s.\nDied on May 09 2009\n\nAll movies:\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 236 MiB\nDuration                         : 24mn 13s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 361 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 1\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nBit rate                         : 1 223 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.159\nStream size                      : 212 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 62\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 24mn 13s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 22.2 MiB (9%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce3cbc1f70b28b5b28933ca7719933dd77ff287","amp;dn":"KARAGIOZIS+-+Traditional+Greek+Shadows+Theatre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce3cbc1f70b28b5b28933ca7719933dd77ff287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,227,203,193,247,11,40,181,178,137,51,202,119,25,147,61,215,127,242,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
