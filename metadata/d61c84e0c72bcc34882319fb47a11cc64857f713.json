The original line-up was Duncan Redmonds on drums and vocals, Simon Wells on guitar and vocals and Andy Crighton on bass, with Dave Redmonds being added to the line-up on trombone before the release of Flibbiddydibbiddydob.\n\nSnuff have released their material through a variety of independent record labels including their own, 10past12records, as well as on Fat Wreck Chords a label owned by Fat Mike of NOFX.\n\nThe band signed to the Workers Playtime label and their first release was the Not Listening Anymore EP, which received regular airplay from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, and reached number nine in the UK Independent Chart.[2] Their first album was named Snuff Said, but the full album name was Snuffsaidbutgorblimeyguvstonemeifhedidn'tthrowawobblerchachachachachachachachachachachayou'regoinghomeinacosmicambience, which started their habit of playing on their supposed Cockney roots. The album peaked at number three on the Indie Chart.[2]\n\nFollowing up from their first album was the 'mini-album' Flibbiddydibbiddydob, featuring mainly cover versions and TV commercial jingles reworked by the band. The release was the subject of a disgreement with the British Phonographic Industry (BPI); Snuff maintained it was an EP - and as such should be eligible for the UK Singles Chart - but the BPI insisted on classifying it as an album because of the large number of tracks.\n\nIn 1991, Snuff split up.[1] During this period all three members applied to be the bassist for Leatherface. The break-up also spawned Guns n' Wankers and Your Mum.\n\n1994 saw a new Snuff appear. The line-up now included Hammond and trombone players, helping to define Snuff's new sound. Simon Wells had by this point left the band, and had been replaced by Loz Wong who had performed as part of Your Mum, and Andy Crighton was replaced by Lee Batsford on bass, with Duncan's brother Dave added on trombone. They soon released a Christmas single, the theme to &quot;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?&quot;.[1] Steve Lamacq has also featured Snuff on his radio show. Simon Wells has since formed the band, Southport, and has played occasionally with Duncan under the name Footballer's Wives. Since the release of &quot;Blue Gravy&quot;, Paul Thompson has also guested on guitar and vocals.\n\nIn 2005, Snuff released a greatest hits double album. Since then they have been on hiatus. Also in 2005, Duncan Redmonds released a self-titled solo project CD Billy No Mates, and at live shows his solo material is combined with some Snuff and Guns n' Wankers songs. Billy No Mates have two touring bands, one in Japan and one in the UK, and Redmonds has recorded different EP's with each band.\n\n2006 saw a new band called Pot Kettle Black formed. This featured Redmonds on drums, Wells on guitar, and Wes Wasley completing the trio on bass. The line up played a mixture of old Snuff songs (generally up until Demmamussabebonk), and new material in the same vein. The project was pronounced 'dead' by Redmonds on the 10 Past 12 Records website guestbook in August 2007.[3] Since then, Redmond has played a series of gigs in Japan with Duncan's Divas, and embarked on solo acoustic gigs in the UK.\n\nIn 2008, a brief tour of Japan was announced, featuring gigs in Tokyo.[4] Following this, the band continued to gig in 2009, supporting NOFX in Birmingham and London on their UK tour, and announcing that they will play both the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The current line-up of the band is Duncan Redmonds on drums/vocals, Loz Wong on guitar, Lee Erinmez on bass, Dave Redmonds on trombone and Lee 'The Mod' Murphy on hammond. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnuff Said 1989 \n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nWords Of Wisdom\nSome-How\nNow You Don't Remember\nNot Listening\nI See / H.M.
