This in-depth introduction to the field of computer-game design offers specific, practical advice for those teens. Following a basic history of computer games and information about game types and rating levels, chapters, which are illustrated with many color photos, profile contemporary professionals and delve into current trends and the day-to-day work of game creators. A final chapter features game creatorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ answers to young gamersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ questions. Frequent text boxes add suggestions for further research, as does an appended list of resources. The closing activity includes write-in blanks, which is unfortunate in a library book, though thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a warning to take pen to page only if the reader is the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s owner. Even so, this title in the Virtual Apprentice series offers valuable information about a high-interest area, and will be widely purchased by libraries. Grades 6-9. --Gillian Engberg ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66f1ab0eb2090e83d3cf06d977dc273c4fcd9274","amp;dn":"%5BDon_Rauf%2C_Monique_Vescia%5DComputer+Game+Designer+%28Virtual+Appren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66f1ab0eb2090e83d3cf06d977dc273c4fcd9274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,241,171,14,178,9,14,131,211,207,6,217,119,220,39,60,79,205,146,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
