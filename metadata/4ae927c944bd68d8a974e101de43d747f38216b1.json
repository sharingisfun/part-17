The Wild Vegan\nCookbook will teach you how to take advantage, sustainably and safely, of the wild plants that thrive in local parks, woodlands, fields, and other open spaces, as well as the underuse natural foods increasingly available in markets.\nForaging and natural-cooking expert and longtime vegan Steve Brill thoroughly explains how you can use nearly 150 wild American plants to create dishes that are good for you and taste great. More than 500 diverse recipes are organized by season and give non-foraging cooks excellent non-wild alternative ingredients. Brill has created a comprehensive, groundbreaking culinary reference that anyone can use to create wonderful food.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae927c944bd68d8a974e101de43d747f38216b1","amp;dn":"The+Wild+Vegan+Cookbook+by+Steve+Brill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae927c944bd68d8a974e101de43d747f38216b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,233,39,201,68,189,104,216,169,116,225,1,222,67,215,71,243,130,22,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
