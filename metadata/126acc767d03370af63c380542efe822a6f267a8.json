He is unceremoniously dumped by his whorish girlfriend Fiona on graduation day. Among the people he turns to in his hour of despair is his German pen pal, Mike. Scott and Mike seem to have a special connection. After Mike makes advances to Scott now that he and Fiona are not seeing each other, Scott abruptly sends Mike a message saying he never wants to hear from him again. However, Scott learns shorty thereafter that Mike is actually a beautiful girl named Mieke. By this time, Mieke has blocked his messages. Thinking that Mieke is actually who he was meant to be with, Scott, impulsively for a change, decides to go to Berlin to be with her. Along for the ride is ScottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, the girl crazy Cooper Harris. They manage only to get a flight into LondonÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nScreenShot:: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgit.me/i/0S2V5d8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgit.me/i/0S2V5d8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgit.me/i/5p3i2W8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgit.me/i/5p3i2W8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgit.me/i/1h4Z6F7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgit.me/i/1h4Z6F7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:126acc767d03370af63c380542efe822a6f267a8","amp;dn":"Euro+Trip+%282004%29+%5BDual+Audio%5D+BRRip+720P%7E%7EViperBlood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"126acc767d03370af63c380542efe822a6f267a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,106,204,118,125,3,55,10,246,60,56,5,66,239,232,34,166,242,103,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
