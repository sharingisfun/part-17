Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work. If you've used music software before, you're already familiar with one half of Ableton Live. Live's Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically.\n\nBut Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a unique sketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops - everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with Live's flexible track routing and more - all without interrupting your creative flow. \n\n\n\nChangelog\n\nAdded control surface support for the Akai Professional MPD218, MPD226 and MPD232 controllers.\nAdded control surface support for the Akai Professional Advance keyboard series.\n\n\nFixed a crash which might take place in Live 9.2 when scanning or instantiating a number of 32-bit plugins.\nAuto-scrolling in session view could get stuck after releasing the mouse, when dragging a device across the splitter between browser and session view.\nFix a rare crash which could occur when closing plugin windows on Mac.\nLive could crash when double clicking on a Rack Chain Macro in the Mapping Browser, while in Macro Map mode.\n\n\nSystem:\n\nPC with Windows 7 or Windows 8; Multicore processor; 4 GB RAM; 1024x768 display;\n3GB free disk space.\n\nInstallation:\n\nUnpack and Install\n\nDrag the Authorize.auz and drop on the .exe\nAbleton must NOT be running.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  It's!
