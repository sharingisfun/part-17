First published as a book on 23rd May 1883, it was originally serialized in the children's magazine Young Folks between 1881ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“82 under the title Treasure Island; or, the mutiny of the Hispaniola and the pseudonym Captain George North.\n\n\nTraditionally considered a coming-of-age story, it is an adventure tale known for its atmosphere, character and action, and also a wry commentary on the ambiguity of moralityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as seen in Long John SilverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½unusual for children's literature then and now. It is one of the most frequently dramatised of all novels. The influence of Treasure Island on popular perception of pirates is vast, including treasure maps with an &quot;X&quot;, schooners, the Black Spot, tropical islands, and one-legged seamen with parrots on their shoulders.\n\n\nCast:\nPeter Jeffrey as Long John Silver\nHugh Paddick as Ben Gunn\nBen Rodska as Jim Hawkins\nJohn Moffat as Squire Trelawny\nGeoffrey Whitehead as Dr Livesey\nStephen Thorne as Captain Smollet\nWally K Daly as `Captain Flint` the Parrot\n\n\n\nTreasure Island\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 87mn 00s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2db9ad308658211e157f3f27711616dfff0afff","amp;dn":"Treasure+Island+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2db9ad308658211e157f3f27711616dfff0afff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,219,154,211,8,101,130,17,225,87,243,242,119,17,97,109,255,240,175,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
