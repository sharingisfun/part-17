Equally impudent in their playful disregard for established musical boundaries, and in their willfully enigmatic public persona, burly-voiced vocalist Gee and shadowy sample-master Scott (no last names given) began working together as Malakai in 2006 (they were later forced to change the name after an Australian rapper laid claim to their original spelling), citing inspiration from Brian Wilson and the Beatles as well as Madlib, Edan, and Massive Attack. With encouragement from Portishead's Geoff Barrow, a longtime friend and local Bristol figurehead, they began releasing music the following year, blurring the perceptual lines between live instrumentation and transparently sampled material on tracks like their debut single &quot;Fading World,&quot; issued on Barrow's Invada imprint, and &quot;The Battle&quot; (later retitled &quot;Shitkickers&quot;), the lead track on a 2007 Island Records EP. After a prospective deal with Island fell through, Malachai released their first album, 2009's Ugly Side of Love, on Invada as well; it was picked up by Domino Records for a U.S. release the following year.\n\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tElectronic\nLabel:\t\t\tDomino\t\n\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Monsters\n02.Anne\n03.Mid Antarctica (Wearin' Sandals)\n04.Rainbows (Featuring Katy Wainwright)\n05.In The Hole\n06.(My) Ambulance\n07.Distance\n08.Monster\n09.The Don't Just\n10.How You Write\n11.Let 'Em Fall\n12.No More Rain No Maureen\n13.Snake Eyes\n14.Hybernation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a8a50b4561a0e726bd5a0ae324adff430e48305","amp;dn":"Malachai+-++The+Ugly+Side+%282011%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a8a50b4561a0e726bd5a0ae324adff430e48305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,138,80,180,86,26,14,114,107,213,160,174,50,74,223,244,48,228,131,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
