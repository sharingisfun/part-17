Aside from capturing the atmosphere of the game--the satisfying thump of boot on football, the on-pitch dramas created between player and referee, and the ferocious roar of the crowd as the ball sails into the back of the net--there are other considerations too. Some players want to manage their teams. Others want to live out their dreams of football stardom. Still others want to put their skills to the test against the best in the world, all the while clamouring for as realistic an experience as possible. FIFA 12 lets you do all of these things and more. For the first time, the PC version uses the same engine as its high-def console counterparts. As a result, it not only looks the part, but also gives you access to the same excellent new features, such as the tactical defending system, player impact engine, and head-to-head seasons. It's the new EA Sports Football Club that's the real draw, though, bringing with it an addictive levelling system that pits you against the world's players, keeping track of your own progress and that of your favourite team too. Not only is FIFA 12 the best game in the series, it's also one of the most exciting, accurate, and complete sports games around.\n\nScreens :- http://postimage.org/image/6tn56wvw7/\n \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://postimage.org/image/ozylllslb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://postimage.org/image/ozylllslb/&lt;/a&gt;\n \n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://postimage.org/image/4h3pgjenz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://postimage.org/image/4h3pgjenz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://postimage.org/image/n70ab0wsf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://postimage.org/image/n70ab0wsf/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMinimum System requirements :- \n\n* OS: Windows XP SP2, Vista or Windows 7\n\n* CPU: Intel Core2Duo @ 1.8Ghz or similar\n\n* RAM: 1GB (XP), 2GB (Vista/7)\n\n* HDD: 8 GB free disk space\n\n* Graphics: 256 MB Graphics Memory with shader model 3\n\n* Sound Card: DirectX 9 Compatible\n\n* DirectX: Version 9\n \n\nSupported Graphic Cards :- \n\nATI RadeonÃ¢â€žÂ¢ HD 3600, NVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT, IntelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sandy Bridge (HD Graphics 2000) and Ivy Bridge (HD Graphics 3000)\n\n\nGame Tested And Runs Smoothly On Windows 7 Ultimate(64bit) And On Windows 7 Home Premium(32bit)\n\nEnjoy...\n\nAnd Seed \n\nComments Appreciated \n\nMy Other Torrents http://piratebay.se/user/evilcraze\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c08cb44e50248ce93153f88ca38e1adb65f7d2e3","amp;dn":"Fifa+12+-+Reloaded+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c08cb44e50248ce93153f88ca38e1adb65f7d2e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,140,180,78,80,36,140,233,49,83,248,140,163,142,26,219,101,247,210,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
