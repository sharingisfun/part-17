The increasing requirement for the general veterinarian to be competent in performing feline surgery has not, however, been supported by a dedicated text on the subject. Feline General and Oncological Surgery assembles an international team of editors and contributors to present the first comprehensive resource devoted solely to all aspects of soft-tissue surgeries in the cat. Techniques are covered in a practical and detailed ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚Ëœhow toÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã‚â„¢ manner and range from the common to the more specialized, ensuring the widest possible appeal.\n\nThe book divides into several sections, initially considering the general approach to the feline surgery patient and then proceeding to detailed coverage of surgery by anatomic location. Part 1 deals with the basics of feline anesthesia, analgesia, preoperative and postoperative care of the patient, surgical instrumentation and surgical principles for oncology cases. Part 2 covers surgical techniques of general and oncological feline diseases and injuries, which are explained as step-by-step methods with many specially prepared schematic illustrations specific to the cat. Emphasis is on presenting both classical methods and new techniques.\n\nFeline Soft Tissue and General Surgery is the perfect sister-text to Feline Orthopedic Surgery and Musculoskeletal Disease, also published by Elsevier. Together they comprise a comprehensive and complete literature giving practial coverage of all possible surgical procedures in the cat.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e195fcbd0a4106fac17d37c3f3131f5c89a0c468","amp;dn":"Feline+Soft+Tissue+and+General+Surgery+%5BPDF%5D%5B2014%5D%7Btahir%7D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e195fcbd0a4106fac17d37c3f3131f5c89a0c468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,149,252,189,10,65,6,250,193,125,55,195,243,19,31,92,137,160,196,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
