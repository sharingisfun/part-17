This 198-page book gives you the background, rules, datasheets, and battle reports that you\\&amp;#039;ll need to take your games to this huge level.\n\nThe sections of the expansion book include:\n\n    * 12-page Introduction\n    * Exterminatus\n    * Fighting Apocalyptic Battles\n    * Apocalyptic Forces\n    * The Battle of Cold Steel Ridge\n    * Datasheets\n    * Organising a Battle\n    * Battle for the Kan Factory\n    * Armies and Battlefields\n    * Strategic Assets\n\nOK, a caviat: This file is missing some pages. I downloaded a majority of the file from a broken torrent and did a corrupt pdf recovery on it. Most of the missing pages come from the painting or battle report parts of the book, but some of the datasheets may be missing as well. All of the rules are intact. \n\nMissing pages: \n27-31 (Tyranid v Space Marine Battle Report)\n75 (Page two of defense laser picture spread)\n83-86 (Chaos v. Imperial Battle Report)\n98-99 (From the special rules section on flyers and titans. Sorry about this one! )\n120-121 (Picture spread. Not sure which!)\n154-155 (Another picture spread)\n179-182 (Ork v. Eldar Battle report)\n\nAgain, I didn\\&amp;#039;t leave these pages out for fun - I did a corrupted file repair on a mostly downloaded book (98.7%) And this is the result.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7d7f9e27510b06b6dc23919420210e70e5186c","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40k+Apocalypse+Codex+%2ASOME+MISSING+PAGES%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7d7f9e27510b06b6dc23919420210e70e5186c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,125,127,158,39,81,11,6,182,220,35,145,148,32,33,14,112,229,24,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
