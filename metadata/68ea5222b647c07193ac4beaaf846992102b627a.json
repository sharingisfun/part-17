However, each track has a far longer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“studio chatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ intro than on any other Rockband discs currently available.\n\nEach track on this album has an extended intro with studio sound related to that song (the studio takes from which these came remain unclear). Some intros include band chat, others instrumental warm ups - ranging from interesting to pointless. These intros are much longer than those presented on WWII and Rattlesnake Rockband CDs, making this a fairly interesting disc.\n\nThese sections of chat were prepared for the Rockband game, and have also been used during the Making Of Love Documentary, however, during the game they only feature in short length of a few seconds as the game is loading, but on this disc the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“studio chatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is presented at much greater length.\n\nAs ever with Rockband extractions, these mixes are excellent quality, some argue they are better than the Remasters released on 09/09/09, but I think you should make that judgement yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n[Total track runtime] (Intro runtime)\n\n01.
