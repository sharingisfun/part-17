Annie Laurie and Danny Boy may be found on other albums.\n\nThis album recording was slightly over modulated so there will be some distortion.  I tried to keep it at a minimum, but then I couldn't hear the soft spots.  \n\nAs this is from vinyl hiss and pop will be evident.  No processing was performed on the tracks except to edit out silence before and after the tracks.\n\nThis was recoded using Cool Edit Pro then saved as a 128k mp3.\n\ndocfester","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b575a450d9e02bb605839e0aeb6a1300b666731","amp;dn":"The+King%27s+Singers+Atlantic+Bridge+1979","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b575a450d9e02bb605839e0aeb6a1300b666731","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,87,90,69,13,158,2,187,96,88,57,224,174,182,161,48,11,102,103,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
