In this beautiful full-color health guide and cookbook--which requires only a juicer or blender to use--the founders of Los Angeles-based Pressed Juicery explain how juicing and juice cleansing can be part of a fit and healthy lifestyle. Featuring seventy-five recipes for the shop's most popular juices--including greens, roots, citrus, fruits, aloe and chlorophyll waters, and signature beverages like Chocolate Almond and Coconut Mint Chip--this inspirational handbook outlines the benefits of juicing, explains how to do a juice cleanse safely, and shares testimonials from people who have experienced personal health transformations after integrating juice into their lives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tFenM4T.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tFenM4T.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7080908cf56f2154e1dbd909854eedd1a1839d0","amp;dn":"Juice+-+Recipes+for+Juicing%2C+Cleansing%2C+and+Living+Well","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7080908cf56f2154e1dbd909854eedd1a1839d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,8,9,8,207,86,242,21,78,29,189,144,152,84,238,221,26,24,57,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
