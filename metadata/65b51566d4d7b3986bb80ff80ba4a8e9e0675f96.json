The competition from younger artists threatens her star status. \nUnder pressure from her young boyfriend RosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio to assume her female identity, the sex change operation that will transform her into a woman, Tonia struggles against her deeply-held religious convictions. If, on the one hand, she wants to be the woman that RosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio so desires, on the other, she knows that before God she can never be that woman. And her son, whom she abandoned when he was a child, now a deserter, comes looking for her. \nTonia discovers that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ill. To get away from all her troubles she travels to the countryside with RosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio, on the excuse of visiting his brother. RosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rio takes the road of his childhood but will never find the right way. Lost, they find themselves in an enchanted forest, a magical world where they come across the enigmatic Maria Bakker and her friend Paula. \nAnd that meeting will turn their whole world on its headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» \n\n\nThis movie was chosen by Portugal to represents that country in the Oscar 2011.\n\n\n\nATTENTION: THIS RELEASE IS WITH &quot;BETTER QUALITY&quot; THAN MY ANOTHER UP FROM THIS SAME MOVIE.\n \n\n\nTHIS TORRENT HAS SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH AND BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE.\n \n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed.
