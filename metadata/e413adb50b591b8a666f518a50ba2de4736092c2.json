Nothing was removed or added to the .ISO. Just a guide, some mods &amp; a better crack &amp; a key was included, as well as my personal seal of tested approval.  \n\n***\n\nStep 1. Burn or mount the CD\nStep 2. Install the game(do not register online).\nWhen your asked for a serial key, use \n\ncd key: ****-****-****-****-****(edited for public view, can't allow the key to get black listed).\n\nStep 3. Update the game with the update patch homeworld 2 update V 1.1\n\n**Patch Install Guide***\n\nDO NOT CRACK THE GAME YET!!
