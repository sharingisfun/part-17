The group was the last major act to emerge from the psychedelic San Francisco music scene of the 1960s and it enjoyed massive success at the end of the decade and into the early '70s. The musical direction then changed to a more contemplative and jazzy style as the band's early personnel gradually departed, leaving the name in the hands of Carlos Santana, who guided the group to consistent commercial success over the next quarter-century. By the mid-'90s, Santana seemed spent as a commercial force on records, though the group continued to attract audiences for its concerts worldwide. But the band made a surprising and monumental comeback in 1999 with Supernatural, an album featuring many guest stars that became Santana's best-selling release and won a raft of Grammy Awards.\n\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Jingo\n02.Evil Ways\n03.Soul Sacrifice\n04.Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\n05.Oye Como Va\n06.Samba Pa Ti\n07.Everybody's Everything\n08.No One To Depend On\n09.Toussaint L'overture\n10.Guajira\n11.La Fuente Del Ritmo\n12.In A Silent Way (Live)\n13.Love, Devotion And Surrender\n14.Mirage\n15.Carnaval\n16.Let The Children Play\n17.Jugando\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.She's Not There\n02.Dance Sister Dance (Baila Mi Hermana)\n03.Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)\n04.Stormy\n05.Well...All Right\n06.Open Invitation\n07.Aqua Marine\n08.You Know That I Love You\n09.All I Ever Wanted\n10.Winning\n11.Hold On\n12.Nowhere To Run\n13.Say It Again\n14.Veracruz\n15.Blues For Salvador\n16.The Healer\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe77034e432ab02cdf901ae33ee0e1a4cca23285","amp;dn":"Santana+-+The+Essential+Santana+%282002%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe77034e432ab02cdf901ae33ee0e1a4cca23285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,119,3,78,67,42,176,44,223,144,26,227,62,224,225,164,204,162,50,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
