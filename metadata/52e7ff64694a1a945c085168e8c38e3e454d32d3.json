They were formed in Woking, Surrey. While they shared the &quot;angry young men&quot;\noutlook and fast tempos of their punk rock contemporaries, The Jam wore neatly tailored\nsuits rather than ripped clothes, and they incorporated a number of mainstream 1960s rock\ninfluences rather than rejecting them, placing The Jam at the forefront of the mod revival\nmovement.\n\nThey had 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to\ntheir breakup in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, &quot;That's\nEntertainment&quot; and &quot;Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?&quot; remained the best-selling import\nsingles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of\nwhich, The Gift, hit number one on the UK album charts. When the group split up, their first\n15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.\n\nCollection of 49 digitally remastered tracks on two CDs from Paul Weller, Bruce Foxton and\nRick Buckler AKA The Jam. This trio remains one of the most successful singles bands in\nEngland, notching up consecutive Number One singles during the last few years of their\nexistence. Although they never made inroads in America during their short life-span (1977-\n82), their legend and legacy has continued to grow in the U.S. with tracks like 'Town Called\nMalice' (included here) used on numerous movie soundtracks and bands like Green Day\nproudly admitting the influence the band has had on them. This compilation features classic\npunk/pop/mod anthems like 'In The City', 'Down In The Tube Station At Midnight', 'The\nModern World', 'To Be Someone', 'The Eton Rifles', 'The Butterfly Collector, 'Going\nUnderground' and more..\n\n\n[Disc 1]\n\n  01 - In The City                          [02:19]\n  02 - Away From The Numbers                [04:02]\n  03 - The Modern World                     [02:30]\n  04 - David Watts                          [02:55]\n  05 - Down In The Tube Station At Midnight [04:00]\n  06 - It's Too Bad                         [02:36]\n  07 - To Be Someone                        [02:29]\n  08 - Mr. Clean                            [03:29]\n  09 - English Rose                         [02:50]\n  10 - The Butterfly Collector              [03:08]\n  11 - The Eton Rifles                      [03:58]\n  12 - Private Hell                         [03:50]\n  13 - Thick As Thieves                     [03:39]\n  14 - Smithers-Jones                       [03:00]\n  15 - Saturdays Kids                       [02:52]\n  16 - Going Underground                    [02:55]\n  17 - Start!
