Kim is 15; his father and step-mother have two buffalo, their lifeline as subsistence rice farmers. During the rainy season, there's no grass and the buffalo are starving. Kim volunteers to take the beasts inland to find food. On this coming-of-age journey, Kim sees men mistreat women, men fight with men, and French taxes rob the poor. He works for Lap, a buffalo herder whose past is entangled with Kim's parents, and he makes friends who will lead him to his place in the world.&quot;\n\n\nFormat: AVI\nFormat/Info: Audio Video Interleave\nFormat settings: rec\nFile size: 697 MiB\nDuration: 1h 38mn\nOverall bit rate mode: Variable\nOverall bit rate: 985 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nID: 0\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile: Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP: 3\nFormat settings, QPe: No\nFormat settings, GMC: No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID: XVID\nCodec ID/Hint: XviD\nDuration: 1h 38mn\nBit rate : 846 Kbps\nWidth: 672 pixels\nHeight: 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio: 1.85:1\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nColor space: YUV\nChroma subsampling: 4:2:0\nBit depth: 8 bits\nScan type: Progressive\nCompression mode: Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.137\nStream size: 599 MiB (86%)\nWriting library: XviD 1.1.0 (UTC 2005-11-22)\n\nAudio\n\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version: Version 1\nFormat profile: Layer 3\nMode: Joint stereo\nCodec ID: 55\nCodec ID/Hint: MP3\nDuration : 1h 38mn\nBit rate mode: Variable\nBit rate: 128 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode: Lossy\nStream size : 88.6 MiB (13%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration: 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration: 245 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.93","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372818ebf7076da2caa8d71e5707458862da7aeb","amp;dn":"The+Buffalo+Boy+%28M%26ugrave%3Ba+len+tr%26acirc%3Bu%29+%282004%29+-+s0ryt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372818ebf7076da2caa8d71e5707458862da7aeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,40,24,235,247,7,109,162,202,168,215,30,87,7,69,136,98,218,122,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
