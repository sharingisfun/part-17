Described by Hamilton as a &quot;forty-minute existential meltdown,&quot; Knives and Teeth tackles weighty subject matter including sin, redemption, politics, and mortality, with highlights arriving via standout cuts like &quot;When I Build My Fortune,&quot; &quot;Goddamn,&quot; &quot;This Thing Ain't Going Nowheres,&quot; and &quot;Bullseye Blues.&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8182d09b31d005f6e8457b80b6d6bf403fe4af45","amp;dn":"American+Babies+-+Knives+and+Teeth+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8182d09b31d005f6e8457b80b6d6bf403fe4af45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,130,208,155,49,208,5,246,232,69,123,128,182,214,191,64,63,228,175,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
