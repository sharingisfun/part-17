The reunion renewed friendships, but dynamic shifts reveal new and old tensions that need confronting and resolving. Directed by Stephen Kijak (Stones in Exile, Scott Walker - 30 Century Man), this is a surprising and rewarding journey filmed over 2 years that delves into the extremes of fame, fortune, betrayal and renewal.\n\nDirector: Stephen Kijak\n\nActors: Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, A.J. McLean, Kevin Scott Richardson\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 41 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:388d0b4e920949a01e5f1934e7c3f9388f8ac964","amp;dn":"Backstreet+Boys%3A+Show+%27Em+What+You%27re+Made+Of.+Trailer+%231","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"388d0b4e920949a01e5f1934e7c3f9388f8ac964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,141,11,78,146,9,73,160,30,95,25,52,231,195,249,56,143,138,201,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
