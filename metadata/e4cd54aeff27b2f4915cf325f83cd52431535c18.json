His first assignment is to treat the brother of a beautiful woman named Katya Treville. As he and her family become friendly, he realizes they are haunted by an old, dark secret . . . but he can't help falling deeply in love with Katya.\n\nJean-Marc is warned by Katya's brother that she is delicate and that he should curb his attentions, but he is young, hopeful, and in love . . . and he is certain that Katya returns his affections. When Jean-Marc learns that the Trevilles are planning to leave the village forever, he insists on a final meeting with Katya. That meeting and the events that follow turn what was an idyllic romance into an unending nightmare. Katya's secret is revealed in a thrilling tale that is part love story and part psychological thriller, and the chilling climax will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4cd54aeff27b2f4915cf325f83cd52431535c18","amp;dn":"Trevanian+-+The+Summer+of+Katya+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4cd54aeff27b2f4915cf325f83cd52431535c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,205,84,174,255,39,178,244,145,92,243,37,248,60,213,36,49,83,92,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
