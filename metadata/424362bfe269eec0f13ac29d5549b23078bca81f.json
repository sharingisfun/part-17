Timothy Hilton has a more challenging purpose: to define Picasso's achievement and his place within twentieth-century art. The constant factor among all Picasso's startling changes of style is his response to other artists, and the conflicts within his work are those of twentieth - century art itself. In his apprentice years he matched himself against the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, echoing even Van Gogh; and in his blue period, with its haunting message of isolation, he became the last and greatest Symbolist painter. Cubism, which he and Braque created together, is a working out of Cezanne's radical discoveries about the nature of space.
