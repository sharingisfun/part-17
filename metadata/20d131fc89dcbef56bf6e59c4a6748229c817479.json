I spent all last week grabbing comedy albums which I am now going to upload here. Other than going to the trouble of fixing tags and getting artwork and details, these torrents are as the original posters seeded them. I am not endorsing or recommending all of these. In fact, I think some of them suck. However, there is a major lack of well seeded comedy torrents here, and I hope to encourage more people to post new ones. Also, who says *MY* taste matches somebody elses? The reviews are from ALLMUSIC or from AMAZON. As usual, much thanks to the OPs who put these out and about.\n\nRambam1776\n\n\n\nSTEWART LEE ?
