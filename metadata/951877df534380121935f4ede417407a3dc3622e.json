Visionaries Gary Lincoff and Larry Evans lead us on a hunt for the wild mushroom and the deeper cultural experiences attached to the mysterious fungi. The oldest and largest living organisms recorded on Earth are both fungi. And their use by a new, maverick breed of scientists and thinkers has proven vital in the cleansing of sites despoiled by toxins and as a &quot;clean&quot; pesticide, among many other environmentally friendly applications. Combining material filmed at the Telluride Mushroom Fest with animation and archival footage, along with a neo-psychedelic soundtrack by The Flaming Lips, this film opens the doors to perception, taking the audience on an extraordinary trip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:951877df534380121935f4ede417407a3dc3622e","amp;dn":"know.your.mushrooms.2008.festival.docu.dvdrip.xvid-nodlabs.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"951877df534380121935f4ede417407a3dc3622e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,24,119,223,83,67,128,18,25,53,244,237,228,23,64,122,61,195,98,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
