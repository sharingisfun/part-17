It is an approach to agile software development that takes cues from Test Driven Development, Domain Driven Design, and Acceptance Test Driven Planning.\n\nRSpec and Cucumber are the leading Behaviour Driven Development tools in Ruby. RSpec supports Test Driven Development in Ruby through the BDD lens, keeping your focus on design and documentation while also supporting thorough testing and quick fault isolation. Cucumber, RSpecÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s steadfast companion, supports Acceptance Test Driven Planning with business-facing, executable requirements documentation that helps to ensure that you are writing relevant software targeted at real business needs.\n\nThe RSpec Book will introduce you to RSpec, Cucumber, and a number of other tools that make up the Ruby BDD family. Replete with tutorials and practical examples, the RSpec Book will help you get your BDD on, taking you from executable requirements to working software that is clean, well tested, well documented, flexible and highly maintainable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c72a9eb7c8f17894e1a92e13d996b86b5b083f16","amp;dn":"Rspec.Book.Beta.Oct.2009.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c72a9eb7c8f17894e1a92e13d996b86b5b083f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,42,158,183,200,241,120,148,225,169,46,19,217,150,184,107,91,8,63,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
