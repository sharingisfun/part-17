Now suddenly I can shoot fireballs, chill your drink,\nor blow-dry your hair at fifty paces with a blink of my eye!\n\nIt all started when this crazy scientist dropped something in my\nGrande Mocha Latte. Of course I got wicked sick. Next morning\nI'm waking up with this total hottie bending over me. He tells\nme 1)his name's Rome Masters, 2)he's a government agent and 3)I\ncan control the four elements with a thought.\n\nHe seems even less pleased by my (apparently irreversible)\ntransformation than I am . . .
