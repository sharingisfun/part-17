In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to Think Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to:\n\n    * Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve\n    * Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries\n    * Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job\n    * Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory\n    * Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems\n\nAlthough the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative artÃ¢â‚¬â€and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer.\n\n\n# Paperback: 256 pages\n# Publisher: No Starch Press (August 8, 2012)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1593274246\n# ISBN-13: 978-1593274245","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c483b174098cbb2c208ff015cdad22b42fb93a2","amp;dn":"Think+Like+a+Programmer+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c483b174098cbb2c208ff015cdad22b42fb93a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,72,59,23,64,152,203,178,194,8,255,1,92,218,210,43,66,251,147,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
