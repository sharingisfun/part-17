He won many titles and awards, including winning the Mr. Universe contest five times, and was named &quot;World's Best-Built Man of the Century.&quot; He became an expert trainer and author on bodybuilding.\n\nThe story of Bill Pearl and a history of bodybuilding as told only as Bill Pearl can with over 200 photographs. This book goes far beyond the usual &quot;schmaltzy&quot; and &quot;humdrum&quot; bodybuilding autobiography. Not just another &quot;sets and reps&quot; publication, this is the story of Bill Pearl's personal journey through life, in which he reveals himself as a well-rounded, talented, intelligent man who was never just a &quot;muscle head.&quot;\n\nPearl's writing is engaging, humorous and honest, without embellishment, and he has more stories to tell than the brothers Grimm! What is constant throughout is his love for the Iron Game and his sadness at some of the changes that have manifested themselves over the years.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pearl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pearl&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/736785.Beyond_the_Universe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/736785.Beyond_the_Universe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3ee8dd27e51db65b5cefd5e8e7ed92e3f5f42c","amp;dn":"Beyond+The+Universe%3A+The+Bill+Pearl+Story.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be3ee8dd27e51db65b5cefd5e8e7ed92e3f5f42c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,62,232,221,39,229,29,182,91,92,239,213,232,231,237,146,227,245,244,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
