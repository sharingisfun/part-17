There are plenty more worthy tracks, including the buoyant &quot;Can't Wait/Live,&quot; the title song (which also charted), and the poignant &quot;Innocent Child,&quot; which makes good use of a sample from Phil Collins' &quot;In the Air Tonight.&quot; The songwriting is some of Jones' strongest in some time, and The Globe was possibly the strongest effort of Big Audio Dynamite (in any incarnation) and certainly their best work since their debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f5e834d1fda7dbb75e56e1b1c0059221ff8a5bb","amp;dn":"Big+Audio+Dynamite+-+The+Globe+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f5e834d1fda7dbb75e56e1b1c0059221ff8a5bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,94,131,77,31,218,125,187,117,229,110,27,28,0,89,34,31,248,165,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
