Among the highlights are the central roles played by multilevel and scale-change approaches in these disciplines.\n\nThe integration of mathematics with physics, as well as molecular and cell biology and the neurosciences, will constitute the new frontier of 21st century science, where breakthroughs are more likely to span across traditional disciplines.\n\n\n\nHardcover: 328 pages\nPublisher: Imperial College Press (May 19, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1848166427\nISBN-13: 978-1848166424","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:383ddc3a161e8c76b3d3a7b8ed702e52a57a6f8b","amp;dn":"New+Trends+in+Geometry+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"383ddc3a161e8c76b3d3a7b8ed702e52a57a6f8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,61,220,58,22,30,140,118,179,211,167,184,237,112,46,82,165,122,111,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
