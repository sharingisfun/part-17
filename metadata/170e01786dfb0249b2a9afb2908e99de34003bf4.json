He had scored previous Bungie projects, including Riven: The Sequel to Myst and Myth: The Fallen Lords, while working for his audio company, TotalAudio, along with Michael Salvatori. O'Donnell was nervous about the project, saying he approached it, &quot;with fear and trepidation&quot;. O'Donnell stated his main influences were music he likedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;a little Samuel Barber meets Giorgio Moroder&quot;. Bungie's Director of cinematics, Joseph Staten told O'Donnell, &quot;the music should give a feeling of importance, weight, and sense of the &quot;ancient&quot; to the visuals of Halo&quot;.\n\nO'Donnell's first piece of music, &quot;Halo&quot;, which would become the &quot;the signature theme for Halo&quot;, was written and recorded in three days. O'Donnell recruited Salvatori and three other colleagues he had recorded jingles withÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Robert Bowker, Jeffrey Morrow, and Rob TrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to produce the &quot;chanting monks&quot; that open the piece. Originally, he had intended the Qawwali accents to be sung by one of the professionals, but after singing an example of what he wanted, the others suggested using O'Donnell's own rendition instead. The theme premiered at the 1999 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo demonstration of Halo: Combat Evolved.\n  \nThe remaining themes were simultaneously written, recorded, and produced from July to September 1999. The music was written with a variety of equipment including, &quot;keyboards, synths, and samplers as well as digital recording equipment controlled by computers&quot;. Live instrumentations, from members of the Chicago Symphony and Chicago Lyric Opera Orchestra, were added where needed. The soundtrack features a wide range of sounds, O'Donnell described it as, &quot;Gregorian chant, string orchestra, percussion and just a bit of a 'Qawwali voice'&quot;. Working closely with level designers, O'Donnell divided the music &quot;into chunks&quot;. Based on these &quot;chunks&quot;, &quot;[Halo's] audio engine could play [the music] back dynamically based on the player's actions&quot;. For the soundtrack release, O'Donnell rearranged the music featured in the game in order to make listening to the soundtrack &quot;more enjoyable&quot;.\n\nAlbums:\n\n2002 - Halo\n2004 - Halo II [Vol 01]\n2006 - Halo II [Vol 02]\n2007 - Halo III\n\nTracks:\n\nHalo\n\n01 - Opening Suite\n02 - Truth And Reconciliation Suite\n03 - Brothers In Arms\n04 - Enough Dead Heroes\n05 - Perilious Journey\n06 - A Walk In The Woods\n07 - Ambient Wonder\n08 - The Gun Pointed At The Head Of The Universe\n09 - Trace Amounts\n10 - Under Cover Of Night\n11 - What Once Was Lost\n12 - Lament For PVT Jenkins\n13 - Devils...Monsters...\n14 - Covenant Dance\n15 - Alien Corridors\n16 - Rock Anthem For Saving The Universe\n17 - The Maw\n18 - Drumrun\n19 - On A Pale Horse\n20 - Perchance To Dream\n21 - Library Suite\n22 - The Long Run\n23 - Suite Autumn\n24 - Shadows\n25 - Dust And Echoes\n26 - Halo\n\nHalo II [Vol 01]\n\n01 - Halo Theme [Mjolnir Mix]\n02 - Blow Me Away\n03 - Peril\n04 - Ghosts Of Reach\n05 - Follow [1st Movement Of The Odyssey]\n06 - Heretic, Hero\n07 - Flawed Legacy\n08 - Impend\n09 - Never Surrender\n10 - Ancient Machine\n11 - 2nd Movement Of The Odyssey\n12 - In Amber Clad\n13 - The Last Spartan\n14 - Orbit Of Glass\n15 - 3rd Movement Of The Odyssey\n16 - Heavy Price Paid\n17 - Earth City\n18 - High Charity\n19 - 4th Movement Of The Odyssey\n20 - Remembrance\n21 - Connected\n\nHalo II [Vol 02]\n\n01 - Prologue\n02 - Cairo Suite\n03 - Mombasa Suite\n04 - Unyielding\n05 - Mausoleum Suite\n06 - Unforgotten\n07 - Delta Halo Suite\n08 - Sacred Icon Suite\n09 - Reclaimer\n10 - High Charity Suite\n11 - Finale\n12 - Epilogue\n\nHalo III\n\n101 - Arrival - Luck\n102 - Sierra 117 - Released\n103 - Sierra 117 - Infiltrate\n104 - Crow's Nest - Honorable Intensions\n105 - Crow's Nest - Last Of The Brave\n106 - Crow's Nest - Brutes\n107 - Tsavo Highway - Out Of Shadow\n108 - Tsavo Highway - To Kill A Demon\n109 - The Storm - This Is Our Land\n110 - The Storm - This Is The Hour\n111 - Floodgate - Dread Intrusion\n112 - Floodgate - Follow Our Brothers\n113 - The Ark - Farthest Outpost\n114 - The Ark - Behold A Pale Horse\n115 - The Ark - Edge Closer\n201 - The Covenant - Three Gates\n202 - The Covenant - Black Tower\n203 - The Covenant - One Final Effort\n204 - The Covenant - Gravemind\n205 - Cortana - No More Dead Heroes\n206 - Cortana - Keep What You Steal\n207 - Halo - Halo Reborn\n208 - Halo - Greatest Journey\n209 - Ending - Tributel\n210 - Ending - Roll Call\n211 - Ending - Wake Me When You Need Me\n212 - Ending - Legend\n213 - [Bonus Track] - Choose Wisely\n214 - [Bonus Track] - Movement\n215 - [Bonus Track] - Never Forget\n216 - [Bonus Track] - Finish The Fight\n217 - [Bonus Track] - Love Your Friends [By Halo 3 Contest Winner Princeton]\n\nEnjoy, SvC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:170e01786dfb0249b2a9afb2908e99de34003bf4","amp;dn":"Halo+Soundtrack+%5BFirst%2C+Second+%26+Third%5D+%5BSvC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"170e01786dfb0249b2a9afb2908e99de34003bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,14,1,120,109,251,2,73,178,169,175,178,144,142,153,222,52,0,59,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
