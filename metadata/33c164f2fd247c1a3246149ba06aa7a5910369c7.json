It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser called Aurora, and is self-contained. If you would prefer to use your existing web browser, install Tor permanently, or if you don't use Windows, see the other ways to download Tor\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33c164f2fd247c1a3246149ba06aa7a5910369c7","amp;dn":"tor-browser-2.2.35-6_en-US","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33c164f2fd247c1a3246149ba06aa7a5910369c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,193,100,242,253,36,124,26,50,70,20,155,160,106,167,165,145,3,105,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
