If you&amp;#039;re familiar with the Dario Argento Giallo/Thriller then you&amp;#039;ll know what great music this is from Goblin. Not &amp;#039;officially&amp;#039; playing under the name Goblin, it&amp;#039;s still the same talented guys giving us some effective, creepy tunes, some great electronica and some perfect prog-rock guitar and synth syncopation. Along with the original LP tracks, the CD also contains eight new previously unreleased versions. \n\nfrom: http://www.moviegrooves.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad5ffbc29721c172b766b37e68531995ab4c776","amp;dn":"Goblin+-+Tenebre+Soundtrack+%281982%29+%28Dario+Argento%5C%27s+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad5ffbc29721c172b766b37e68531995ab4c776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,213,255,188,41,114,28,23,43,118,107,55,230,133,49,153,90,180,199,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
