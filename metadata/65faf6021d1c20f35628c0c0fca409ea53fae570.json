Interactive Entertainment, Harry is mysteriously selected by the Goblet of Fire as the fourth champion in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. Each champion in the international competition must confront a fire-breathing dragon, rescue friends from the icy depths of the Black Lake, and navigate the twisting mysteries of a vast, enchanted maze. Exciting scenes from the film come to life, from the Quidditch World Cup campsite to a heart-stopping duel with Lord Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all playable characters, modeled after their big-screen counterparts. An all-new spell-casting system allows you to feel the magic for the first time as the controller shakes and reacts with every flick of the wand. Team up with friends in co-operative play to combine magic and produce more powerful spells than ever before!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65faf6021d1c20f35628c0c0fca409ea53fae570","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Goblet+of+Fire+%28PS2%29+%28PAL%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65faf6021d1c20f35628c0c0fca409ea53fae570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,250,246,2,29,28,32,243,86,40,192,192,252,164,9,234,83,250,229,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
