Gurjev decides he needs to defeat the rebels and Hakaider &quot;once and for all. &quot;Will Hakaider prove to be a long desired savior, or an unstoppable force that will destroy all?&quot;\n\n-WHAT REALLY HAPPENS-\n\tOld-school Ultraman-type guy gets shot and blows people up. A team of &quot;freedom-fighters&quot; fight the machine, while the ambiguous leader yaks it up with the Hakaider V2,the &quot;good version&quot;. They fight. Feathers fly (for some reason).\n\n-Notes-\nMy first multilanguage release! Now, normally I&amp;#039;m all about the original audio. Dubbing is horrible and ALMOST should never be watched. I say almost because the only case in which you should watch a movie dubbed is if it&amp;#039;s already bad, and you want to add even more hilarity to it. That being said, this movie is bad...and the dubbing is awful. I included the original audio, because that&amp;#039;s what I actually watched it with and some may actually enjoy the movie without the super-cheese factor. That being said, for extra-extra-cheez factor, I recommend watching this movie with the English Dub AND the subtitles on. Usually dubs and subs do differ, but usually I wouldn&amp;#039;t think that they would change entire contexts/plots of films. The dub is so different from the subtitles its awful. This is also the Director&amp;#039;s Cut, which is 17 minutes longer than the original movie. As far as I can tell, the biggest differences were that there were no dream sequences in the original\nrelease, but thats all I noticed in a quick scan. Enjoy!\n\nPS. Make sure you have the OGG splitter so that you can play .OGM files!\n\n\n\nOGM File Details\n========================================\nFilename:\t\t  Mechanical.Violator.Hakaider.DVDRip.LRH.ogm\nTotalSize:          715776 kbyte (699 mbyte).\nBitrate:            992 k(=1000)Bits/s XviD\nDuration:           118:34\nResolution:         576 x 320\nInterleaving:       vbrmp3 128kbps (x2)\nAudio:\t\t  Original Japanese/English Dub\nSubtitles:\t\t  English Subtitles (.srt)\n\n\n-PAST RELEASES-\n\n1.
