The direct antithesis of 2008's stadium ready Do You Like Rock Music?, the largely instrumental Man of Aran (only the folksy &quot;Come Wander with Me,&quot; a cover culled from an obscure 1964 Twilight Zone episode, features vocals) unfolds like a wave in the middle of the ocean with its sights set on a rocky shore. With the main melody of Rock Music's &quot;The Great Skua&quot; as its backbone, British Sea Power's penchant for slow-building post-rock vistas and reverb-drenched bursts of guitar, trumpet, and violin has reached its logical crescendo. While not as awe-inspiring as it yearns to be, Man of Aran deftly fuses the imagery of the open water to the sound it makes when dripping out of a vintage tube amplifier. On its own, listeners may be lulled to the chilly deeps of sleep, but paired with the accompanying DVD, they'll be wiping the salt spray from their brows and pulling long rows of kelp out of their teeth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2484a275ebe272ea8f1b4ba77ee2928be13998","amp;dn":"British+Sea+Power+-+Man+Of+Aran+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa2484a275ebe272ea8f1b4ba77ee2928be13998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,36,132,162,117,235,226,114,234,143,27,75,167,126,226,146,139,225,57,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
