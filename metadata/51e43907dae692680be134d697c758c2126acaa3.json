We are hardworking family members and quite down to earth about dreams of becoming famous rockstars. And yes, we know we\\'re pro.\nOur music happens the way WE want and WHEN we want.\n\nOur Goal\n\nItÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s nothing less than distributing our music as far as possible, all over the world. If you like it - please share it. Every single one of you should help if you like the stuff. Burn it to CDs and gift it - or use places like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Forums, Release-Blogs, Chats etc. to make VOTJ to be something on everyoneÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s lips. We donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t want your personal information and you donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t need to register/sign up anything - we just wanna give you our music and you shall carry it out to the world.\n\n- Release Info -------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  Artist:      Vampires On Tomato Juice\n  Album:       Vampires On Tomato Juice\n  Label:       www.votj.de\n  Playtime:    50:28 min\n  Genre:       Vampire-Metal\n  URL:         www.votj.de\n  Rip date:    2011-07-05\n  Street date: 2011-07-23\n  Size:        92.34 MB\n  Type:        Normal\n  Source:      Direct Studio Mixdowns (final stage)\n  Quality:     VBR MAX (LAME) / 4410kHz / Joint Stereo\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
