The Wall 02:33\n\nThe sound production within the album is very high, guitars strum along in march anthems, electronic distortion pumps in and out, songs are catchy and yet they move traditionally at times, creating epic pieces that fall into chants and building chorus lines.\n\nThematically Feeny states her influence stems from personal experiences with her involvement with the Occupy Wall St. protests in Zuccotti Park in New York City, during which she was arrested.\n\nFeeny paints with the paintbrush of revolution, songs are uplifting and unifying; not despite of but because of the fragile country they sing about... she seems to hint on an underlying human spirit that is greater than all of the greed and corruption she has witnessed.\n\n&quot;America&quot; by Catherine Feeny is an interesting and worthwhile listen, that sometimes finds it's strengths in the personal more than the political.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:501ec4723538afda639f241e25ffb0545602d9be","amp;dn":"Catherine+Feeny+-+America+%5B2012%5D%5B+FLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"501ec4723538afda639f241e25ffb0545602d9be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,30,196,114,53,56,175,218,99,159,36,30,37,255,176,84,86,2,217,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
