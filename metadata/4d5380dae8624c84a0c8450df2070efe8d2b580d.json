Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1992 at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album is named after a slang term for high-grade marijuana, and its cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. It was recorded by Dr. Dre following his departure from hip hop group N.W.A and its label Ruthless Records over a financial dispute, and consequently features both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A-member Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features many appearances by Snoop Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career.\n\nFLAC CD RIP \n\n\nVISIT ME ON THESE SITES\n@RAY_25TH\nwww.RAY25TH.Tumblr.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d5380dae8624c84a0c8450df2070efe8d2b580d","amp;dn":"Dr.+Dre-The+Chronic+%28FLAC+CD+RIP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d5380dae8624c84a0c8450df2070efe8d2b580d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,83,128,218,232,98,76,132,160,200,69,13,242,7,14,254,141,43,88,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
