(A second film adapted from Decalogue, A Short Film About Killing, is also available on Kino DVD). Anticipating themes in his final film Red (Rouge), part III of his renowned Trois Couleurs trilogy, Kieslowski blends reckless romanticism with chilling alienation to produce a courageous and adept examination of human longing.\n\nIMDB - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095467/\n\nWithin the confines of a housing project high-rise, orphan teenager Tomek reaches out from his loveless isolation. His voyeuristic scrutiny of the windows in the building next door spawns a romantic fascination with Magda, a beautiful and promiscuous older woman. Fervent gaze heralds hesitant touch as TomekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyish attempts to reach Magda grow in both resourcefulness and success. Face to face with the woman he adores, Tomek confronts his own doubt and the impenetrable mantle of cynicism and disappointment that keeps Magda unreachable from any distance. For Magda, the spiritual beauty that TomekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s infatuation may awaken within her sets the stage for torment and redemption of Shakespearean dimensions.\nFor A Short Film About Love, Kieslowski added a newly written ending, altered from that of the Dekalog episode, which restructures the narrative. Never before released on U.S. video or DVD, this human, unconventional film about obsession evolves into a love story of extraordinary tenderness and depth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91388f299ebe9cb97ee73f301e2c7cfc5742d119","amp;dn":"Kieslowski+-+A+Short+Film+About+Love+%28Art+Movie+1988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91388f299ebe9cb97ee73f301e2c7cfc5742d119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,56,143,41,158,190,156,185,126,231,63,48,30,44,124,252,87,66,209,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
