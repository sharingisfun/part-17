It also prints speculative articles, ranging from the technical to the philosophical. There is a readers' letters section which discusses recent articles, and discussions also take place on the website.\n\nReaders also contribute observations on examples of pseudoscience to Feedback, and questions and answers on scientific and technical topics to Last Word; extracts from the latter have been compiled into several books.\n\nNew Scientist is based in London, England, and publishes editions in the UK, the United States, and Australia. Sumit Paul-Choudhury became editor in 2011,[4] following Roger Highfield's move to the National Museum of Science and Industry in London.[5]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b3d7cb4b8738c545a02da773b50ebd00628c1fc","amp;dn":"New+Scientist+-+5+April+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b3d7cb4b8738c545a02da773b50ebd00628c1fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,61,124,180,184,115,140,84,90,2,218,119,59,80,235,208,6,40,193,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
