But unknown to either group, the SAS were about to engage in one of the boldest rescue missions in modern history. They were flown deep into the jungle of Sierra Leone in an attempt to release the hostages who had been held for more than two weeks.\n\nWhat happened as the rescue attempt unfolded has always been a closely guarded secret. Now the story of this SAS mission and the terrible days of captivity endured by the hostages is told for the first time by the people who were there. For one of the hostages it is a story of survival in a living hell.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a99b3e01459772c3cc69aa89bb073a271a4fc339","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.10of10.SAS.Mission.Impossible.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a99b3e01459772c3cc69aa89bb073a271a4fc339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,155,62,1,69,151,114,195,204,105,170,137,187,7,58,39,26,79,195,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
