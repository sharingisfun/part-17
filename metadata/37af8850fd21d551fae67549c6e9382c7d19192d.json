A Vietnamese nun asks her for a favorÃ¢â‚¬â€to hand over a check and bring a package back to the temple. But this act of kindness ends in a strangerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death and leaves her with a bullet wound in the arm, a check for 50,000 francs and a trove of ancient jade artifacts whose provenance is a mystery. The French secret service, a group of veterans of the war in Indochina, some wealthy ex-colonials, and contending international oil companies all claim the jade. They will stop at nothing to gain possession of it.
