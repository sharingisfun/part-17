Well, now you can.\n\nTo begin with, it doesn't come with an installer. You have to extract its files into a folder, and manually edit its settings INI file to specify resolution, window behaviour, and other settings. You then have to install VC++ 2013 runtime if you don't already have it (the redistributables are included in the archive), and then run the demo from the relevant batch file. Unreal included both 32-bit and 64-bit executables. Only an Alt+F4 closes the thing down (there's no in-demo UI). There's no internal benchmark, and you're left to use third-party frame-rate loggers.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3139dc27c8aadcccdd0ae7ae23e5a499e2eb9abf","amp;dn":"Unreal+Engine+4+Elemental+Tech+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3139dc27c8aadcccdd0ae7ae23e5a499e2eb9abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,57,220,39,200,170,220,204,221,10,231,174,35,229,164,153,226,235,154,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
