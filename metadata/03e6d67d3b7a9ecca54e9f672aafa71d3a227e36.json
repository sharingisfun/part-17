We can find here genres that are very rarely put on covers, such as doom with Esoteric, hardcore with Number Twelve or Into the Moat, postrock with PTW or old bands that are the roots of everything to come. I topped the list with a Metallica, that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see again. Metallica that succeeded among some others (including Maiden and DT, and not Megadeth or Savatage) to be one of the most important metal band today. So wether you like it or not, they are the most important, and the first band I bought an album of, which is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRide the LightningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The evening, I was buying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMaster of PuppetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. And the day after, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢em AllÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, everything started from there. On that list, you can find some great singles, such as Hoobastank or SOAD, that deserves their credit. I like the idea of seing on that list, Limbonic Art, then Jan Cyrka (french guitarist), CC, Pendragon and then Carcass : no boundaries in metal. Limbonic Art speaking of which, is twice on the list : itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an error, but hey... it took me one month to do it. I agree that the nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â°803 from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAbhorrenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ should be far above, one of the greatest among the greatest in (sympho) black. \nSo my friends, if you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t yet seen the bands you like, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s probably normal, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll come in the next lists. No blabling for the moment, you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen it all. \n\nSorry for the part 901-1000 but I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t update it once more, as I erased it, believing I had done an error, which wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. 5 guys are on it for the moment, and I upload it for a fresh version just after they finish. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e6d67d3b7a9ecca54e9f672aafa71d3a227e36","amp;dn":"METAL+TOP+1000+PART+801-900","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e6d67d3b7a9ecca54e9f672aafa71d3a227e36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,230,214,125,59,122,158,204,165,78,159,103,42,175,167,29,58,34,126,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
