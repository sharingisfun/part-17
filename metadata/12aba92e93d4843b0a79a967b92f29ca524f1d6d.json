Mutants stalk the catacombs beneath the desolate surface, and hunt\n amidst the poisoned skies above\n\n But rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro are locked in a\n struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults\n of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of the\n earth forever\n\n As Artyom, burdened by guilt but driven by hope, you hold the key to our\n survival the last light in our darkest hour\n\n  Install notes:\n\n  1.
