The possibilities, it seems, are limitless.\n\nPart 2: Race for Absolute Zero\nFocuses on the fierce rivalry that took place in the laboratories in Britain, Holland, France and Poland as they sought the ultimate extreme of cold. The program will follow the extraordinary discoveries of superconductivity and superfluidity and the attempt to produce a new form of matter that Albert Einstein predicted would exist within a few billionths of degrees above absolute zero.\n\nTechnical specs:\n\nIt&amp;#039;s MVGroup, what do you think?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b347c00cafa952b3f1b7db755a8cc394bb677fea","amp;dn":"BBC+Absolute+Zero+2of2+The+Race+for+Absolute+Zero+2007+DVBC+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b347c00cafa952b3f1b7db755a8cc394bb677fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,71,192,12,175,169,82,179,241,183,219,117,90,140,195,148,187,103,127,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
