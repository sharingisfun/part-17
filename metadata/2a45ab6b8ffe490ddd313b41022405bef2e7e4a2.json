Mark my words: if Future Babble is widely read, then within 3.7 years the number of overconfident predictions by self-anointed experts talking through their hats will decline by 46.2%, and the world will become no less than 32.1% wiser.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of How the Mind Works and The Stuff of Thought\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Well-researched, well-reasoned, and engagingly written. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not making any predictions, but we can only hope that this brilliant book will shock the human race, and particularly the chattering expert class, into a condition of humility about proclamations about the future.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ John Mueller, author of Overblown and Political Scientist, Ohio State University\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As Yogi Berra observed, 'it's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.' In this brilliant and engaging book, Dan Gardner shows us how tough forecasting really is, and how easy it is to be convinced otherwise by a confident expert with a good story. This is must reading for anyone who cares about the future.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Paul Slovic, Professor of Psychology, University of Oregon\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you are paying a lot of money for forecasting services Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be they crystal ball gazers or math modelers or something in between Ã¢â‚¬â€œ put your orders on hold until you have had a chance to read this book Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a rare mix of superb scholarship and zesty prose. You may want to cancel, or at least re-negotiate the price. For the rest of us who are just addicted to what experts are telling us everyday in every kind of media about what the future holds, Future Babble will show you how to be a bit smarter than what you usually hear.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Philip Tetlock, author of Expert Political Judgement and Mitchell Professor of Organizational Behavior, Hass School of Business, University of California\n\nFrom the Hardcover edition.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nDAN GARDNER is a prize-winning journalist and author of Risk: Why We Fear the Things We Shouldn't Ã¢â‚¬â€ and Put Ourselves in Greater Danger.
