And the stakes are high Ã¢â‚¬â€ the team with the worst Pit Fire dish is sent home on the spot.\n\nThis isn't a competition for the casual cook. \nFrom being over the pit non-stop for over 10 hours, to facing unexpected challenges, these aspiring Pitmasters all have the goal of satisfying the picky palates of the judging panel and taking home the $100,000 prize.\n It's the biggest competition of their lives in the all-new season of BBQ Pitmasters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbd93f8211ef9f5b101edb644a7f260df23131b","amp;dn":"BBQ+Pitmasters+S03E04+X264-CRiMSON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fbd93f8211ef9f5b101edb644a7f260df23131b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,189,147,248,33,30,249,245,177,1,237,182,68,167,242,96,223,35,19,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
