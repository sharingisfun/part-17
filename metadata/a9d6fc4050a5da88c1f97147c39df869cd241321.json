He is also a man haunted by a terrible skillÃ¢â‚¬â€the ability to track people who don't want to be found.\n\nRosetta is a runaway slave fueled by the passion and determination only a mother can feel. She bears the scarsÃ¢â‚¬â€inside and outÃ¢â‚¬â€of a life lived in servitude to a cruel and unforgiving master. Her flight is her one shot at freedom, and she would rather die than return to the living hell that she has left behind.\n\nIn the perilous years before the Civil War, the fates of these two remarkable people will intertwine in an extraordinary adventureÃ¢â‚¬â€a journey of hardship and redemption that will take them from Virginia to Boston and backÃ¢â‚¬â€and one that will become an extraordinary test of character and will, mercy and compassion. It is an odyssey that will change them both forever.\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d6fc4050a5da88c1f97147c39df869cd241321","amp;dn":"Soul+Catcher+by+Michael+White","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d6fc4050a5da88c1f97147c39df869cd241321","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,214,252,64,80,165,218,136,193,249,113,71,195,157,248,105,205,36,19,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
