Includes CUE file.\n\n\nIt's the one you could get by registering your copy of the game until June 20, 2011, I think. So if you didn't register the game in time, better download! :)\n\nIncludes scans of cover and booklet!\nThe booklet is available in English, German (Deutsch), French (FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais), Italian (Italiano), Spanish (EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol), Nederlands and Portuguese (PortuguÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªs).\nThe quality of these isn't great, because of my scanner. Sorry :(\n\nI tried to be the most accurate possible with the audio tags (and included ReplayGain tags).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066a93cc7c5f84e22aa923242b9e0cccedd40dfe","amp;dn":"%5BFLAC%5D+The+Legend+of+Zelda%3A+Ocarina+of+Time+3D+Official+Soundtra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066a93cc7c5f84e22aa923242b9e0cccedd40dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,106,147,204,124,95,132,226,42,169,35,36,43,158,12,204,237,212,13,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
