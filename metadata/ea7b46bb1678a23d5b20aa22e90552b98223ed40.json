Unzip *everything* inside the downloaded .7z archive (normally\n   &quot;HIP - &lt;RELEASE DATE&gt;.7z&quot;) directly into your mod folder.\n2. If on Mac OS X, proceed to the Mac OS X Installation below. If on\n   Windows, continue.\n3. Run HIP.exe, which was unzipped into your mod folder.\n4. Answer the questions the command line asks. Default is &quot;yes&quot; for\n   every question.\n5. Enable HIP through the launcher and start the game.\n6. *Optionally* delete python27.dll, library.zip, HIP.exe, main.py,\n   the original .7z archive, and even this file. You will probably\n   want to keep at least the original .7z archive, though.\n\n=====================\nMac OS X Installation\n\n1. Unzip *everything* inside the downloaded .7z archive (normally\n   &quot;HIP - &lt;RELEASE DATE&gt;.7z&quot;) directly into your mod folder.\n\n2. Find the application Terminal that comes with your Mac. It is\n   impossible to uninstall and bundled with every Mac. If it's not on\n   your Launcher already, then search Finder under Applications for\n   Terminal. It should be in a subfolder in Applications with other\n   system utilities. Run Terminal.\n\n3. Copy and then paste the following line of text, precisely, into the\n   Terminal window:\n\npython &quot;Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/main.py&quot;\n\n4. If you didn't paste the line-ending as well and the text is just\n   sitting there, it's waiting for you to press ENTER. Hit ENTER.\n   \n5. You should now be running the automatic installer, and your\n   experience should be identical to that of Windows, except Terminal\n   is a lot more user-friendly than the Windows console.\n\n6. Answer the questions prompted on the command line. Default is &quot;yes&quot;\n   for every question.\n\n7. Run CKII. Enable HIP through the launcher, make sure any\n   incompatible mods (such as old versions of HIP mods) are\n   deselected, and enjoy the game!\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nIf you experience any problems running the installer through Terminal,\nexecute the following commands on the command prompt, and then\ncopy/paste their output into your bug report / question on the forums:\n\nFirst, from a freshly-started Terminal, try running (copy/paste to\nmake sure you don't make any syntax mistakes):\n\npython &quot;Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/main.py&quot; -V\n\nIf that works, copy all the output from that command (scroll up if you\nhave to do so) into your forum post.  That tells us everything we need\nto know about your system, python version, HIP installer version, etc.\n\nIf that doesn't work, the file &quot;main.py&quot; that you were supposed to\nextract into your mod folder probably isn't where we expect it to be\nfor some reason.  Indicate in your post if you have a non-standard\nmod folder location, as that would break these instructions. Check for\na &quot;main.py&quot; wherever you DID extract the 7zip archive. Was that in the\nright place?  Finally, what output *does* Terminal give you instead of\nrunning the installer?\n\nIf the installer ran but could not complete or did something obviously\nbroken mid-way through, try running it this way and repeating the steps\nthat made it crash/error:\n\npython &quot;Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/main.py&quot; -D\n\nThis should generate a file called HIP_debug.log in your mod folder which\nyou can attach on the forums or send in an email to:\n\n\n=====================\nNOTE:\nIf you're using Linux, simply adapt the Mac OS X instructions.\nYou know how to open a terminal.\nThe rest is the same, except for the location of your mod folder.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea7b46bb1678a23d5b20aa22e90552b98223ed40","amp;dn":"Historical+Immersion+Project+-+Crusader+Kings+II+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea7b46bb1678a23d5b20aa22e90552b98223ed40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,123,70,187,22,120,162,61,91,32,170,34,233,5,82,185,130,35,237,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
