At first we avoided such a task as our knowledge of the Gnostic tradition was still evolving and because any outline of religious symbolism can come across as dogmatic. However, as time progressed we realized that if we waited until all the facts were in and we worked to avoid all possible misconceptions, we would end up with the Gnostic Handbook never being written. Accordingly, we believe that within this handbook is a comprehensive summary of the basic principles of the Gnostic tradition. We realize that what we outline in this text is unusual and rightly so, Gnosticism is a unique form of perception and hence offers a very different worldview from that found in Christian, Pagan or Esoteric and Occult traditions. Gnosticism is the essence behind such outer forms and hence offers the framework from which religion, occultism and mythology create the form.\n\nIn recent times with the advent of fundamentalism of all forms, a clear and precise explanation of the ideals of Gnosticism is not only useful, but mandatory. At the onset it should be made clear that Gnosticism is a personal experience of religion. The term Gnosis means &quot;an experience of knowledge&quot; and religion (from the Latin Religio) means &quot;to bind back to the point of origin&quot; and hence Gnosticism is an experience of the real essence of what God is. It does not represent dry dogmatism or a simple recital of facts, but a real and personal experience of God within human experience. It is in this spirit we issue this handbook. The structure of this handbook is aimed to facilitate easy access of information on basic religious questions. This is not meant to be an exhaustive theological exposition but a summary of the teachings which embody the Gnostic legacy which has been passed onto the Institute for Gnostic Studies. The approach we have taken in this handbook has been a religious one, our primary source of symbolism has come from within the Essene, Greek, Gnostic, Zoroastrian and Christian mystical traditions. Other interpretations are certainly possible and for those who wish to get ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbehindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the symbols, interpretations and beliefs we suggest you study the various publications and courses issued by the Institute for Gnostic Studies.\n\nWe hope you will find the Gnostic Handbook edifying as well as enjoyable reading...\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n\n1 What is Gnosticism ?\n\nGnosticism as a form of Perception, the Source of our Tradition, Gnosticism and other Ways of Knowing, Esotericism and Modern Language.\n\n2 The Great Chain of Being\n\nFlatland, the Traditional Model of the Universe, the Axis Mundi and the Sacred Tree, Characteristics of the Traditional Model, the Neo-Platonic Cosmos, Theosophical and Modern Maps, the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Yggdrasil:the World Tree.\n\n3 First Principles\n\nWho or What is God ?
