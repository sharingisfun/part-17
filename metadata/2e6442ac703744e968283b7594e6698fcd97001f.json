Rather than provide detailed mathematics for each of these methods, the book emphasizes what healthcare practitioners need to know to interpret and incorporate the latest biomedical research into their practices.\n\nThe author draws from his own experience developing and teaching biostatistics courses for physicians and nurses, offering a presentation that is non-technical and accessible. The book begins with a basic introduction to the relationship between biostatistics and medical research, asking the question &quot;why study statistics?,&quot; while also exploring the significance of statisitcal methods in medical literature and clinical trials research. Subsequent chapters explore key topics, including:\n\n   Correlation, regression, and logistic regression\n   Diagnostics\n   Estimating means and proportions\n   Normal distribution and the central limit theorem\n   Sampling from populations\n   Contingency tables\n   Meta-analysis\n   Nonparametric methods\n   Survival analysi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6442ac703744e968283b7594e6698fcd97001f","amp;dn":"The+Essentials+of+Biostatistics+for+Physicians+Nurses+and+Clinic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6442ac703744e968283b7594e6698fcd97001f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,100,66,172,112,55,68,233,104,40,59,117,148,230,105,143,205,151,0,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
