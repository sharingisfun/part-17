Completely revised and updated, CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN HEALTH AND ILLNESS examines the differences existing within North America by probing the health care system and consumers, and examples of traditional health/ HEALTH beliefs and practices among selected populations. An emphasis on the influences of recent social, political, and demographic changes helps to explore the issues and perceptions of health and illness today, while new introductory and capstone chapters help place material within perspective. An essential for any health-care professional, this book sets the standard for cultural perspectives and more importantly HEALTHÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe balance of the person, both within oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beingÃ¢â‚¬â€œphysical, mental, and spiritualÃ¢â‚¬â€œand in the outside worldÃ¢â‚¬â€œnatural, communal, and metaphysical. (Terms, such as HEALTH, are written this way to emphasize holistic meaning.)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9b8a61cd2672e8a02962c682cc979d1b528b3b","amp;dn":"Cultural+Diversity+in+Health+and+Illness%2C+8E+%282013%29+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc9b8a61cd2672e8a02962c682cc979d1b528b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,155,138,97,205,38,114,232,160,41,98,198,130,204,151,157,27,82,139,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
