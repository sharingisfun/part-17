Now she has become rich and acquired a big ranch which she runs with an iron hand. Eventually this leads to dire consequences...\n\nThere is a bit too much narration, but the acting is excellent.  If you like ranch sagas, you'll enjoy this one.\n\nIn segmented mpg format - it plays fine, you might have difficulty burning it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f23ac2193c4c2d80f1f9e511df5c45e79d82cdf1","amp;dn":"Do%26ntilde%3Ba+B%26aacute%3Brbara+%281943%29+Maria+Felix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f23ac2193c4c2d80f1f9e511df5c45e79d82cdf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,58,194,25,60,76,45,128,241,249,229,17,223,92,69,231,157,130,205,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
