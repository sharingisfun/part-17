He is rescued by Monlyon, a young man on a camel who is traveling back home after having failed to acquire the skills necessary to save his sweetheart from the clutches of a despotic local lord. The boy's passive naivetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© rubs the cynical older man the wrong way, but Munsu nevertheless parts company having acquired a cute little bat-mascot and a mission. Later, having lain to rest his young acquaintance's wishes, Munsu takes his newly acquired mascot and Sando, an even more recently acquired sidekick, and allows himself to be persuaded by a young amnesiac named Jyun into visiting an island occupied by a suspicious doctor. Something ominous is afoot on the island, and Munsu, despite his protestations that he's not in the business of helping people, is compelled to uncover the truthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½no matter the blood spilled to reach it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52b1fee3eb0aeea54607d8fe8d453b660ac8e686","amp;dn":"Blade+of+the+Phantom+Master+DvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52b1fee3eb0aeea54607d8fe8d453b660ac8e686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,177,254,227,235,10,238,165,70,7,216,254,141,69,59,102,10,200,230,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
