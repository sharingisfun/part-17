It tells the story of ex-convict Jean Valjean, who has spent nineteen brutal years in chains after stealing a loaf of bread. Saved by an act of charity, he is then offered a chance of happiness when he encounters the downtrodden Fantine and vows to rescue her daughter Cosette - but is constantly pursued by the implacable policeman Javert, who will not let him escape his past. An instant bestseller on publication in 1862, The Wretched is a novel of intense emotional power, weaving together individual stories with true historical events to create a rich, imaginative drama of human life.\n\nChristine Donougher's powerful, lucid and authoritative new translation is accompanied by an introduction by Robert Tombs discussing Hugo's life as a novelist and progressive political crusader, and the dramatic historical context of the novel.\n\n---\n\nMany thanks to the original uploader.
