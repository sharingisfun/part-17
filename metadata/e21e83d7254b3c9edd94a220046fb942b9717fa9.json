Join author Scott Onstott as he explores each of these methods, including projecting 2D drawings in model space and using viewports to view a model from various angles in paper space. The course's main focus is AutoCAD's advanced model-documentation features, which allow you to project plans, elevations, sections, and details from a 3D model directly onto layouts.\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e21e83d7254b3c9edd94a220046fb942b9717fa9","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Documenting+AutoCAD+3D+Models+with+Scott+Onstott+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e21e83d7254b3c9edd94a220046fb942b9717fa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,30,131,215,37,75,60,158,221,148,162,32,4,111,185,66,185,113,127,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
