They slither, swim, walk and crawl, leap and lunge, and some spend their entire lives contained within a shell. Their ranks include some of the most skillful predators on Earth. And their long-departed dinosaur ancestors are an unending source of fascination to humanity, both in fiction and scientific endeavor. They are &quot;The Reptiles,&quot; the fascinating subjects of a four-part NATURE miniseries. \n\nPart 1 - Alligators and Crocodiles \n\nWith guidance from leading experts on &quot;Alligators and Crocodiles,&quot; the first episode reveals that the world of these creatures is a lot more complex than we ever imagined. Some of the most surprising sequences reveal that the crocodile is not only the ultimate predator in the natural world but also a highly intelligent animal. The prorgam explores what the future holds for these living dinosaurs. &quot; \n\nmore info: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/reptiles/ \n\n== \nRuntime: 53mins \nSource: OTA High Definition 1080i \nEncoding: xvid.928x528.1710kbps.mp3.160.vbr \nFile Size: 700MB \n\nFederal funding for CPB/PBS is going to be cut significantly over the next two years, so if you watch any of these programs, please support your local PBS Station by making a contribution or by purchasing their DVDs.
