The book tells the rather amusing story of a young trader&amp;#039;s progression to day trading in the then so-called &quot;bucket shops&quot;, and from there to market speculator, market maker and finally market manipulator. Along the way, many lessons are learned by this trader which he shares with the reader. Despite the fact that it was written quite some time ago, this book continues to offer valuable insights into the art of trading and speculation. In addition, it is written in a very breezy and enjoyable style.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c8124b6cf92ae3d0f12ea07ea8e2bd7fa2dbc35","amp;dn":"Jesse++Livermore+-+Reminiscences+of+a+Stock+Operator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c8124b6cf92ae3d0f12ea07ea8e2bd7fa2dbc35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,129,36,182,207,146,174,61,15,18,234,7,234,142,43,215,250,45,188,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
