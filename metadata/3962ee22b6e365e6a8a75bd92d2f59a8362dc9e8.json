All the ingredients were there for a very successful career: Musicianship, production, vision, and songwriting as impressive as the abilities of its creators. Unfortunately, the album was released in very small numbers on vinyl, and later, tape, meanwhile Ãï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¸ÃÂ´ disbanded, resulting in the album and band vanishing from the radar before having a chance to leave a mark.\n\nThe band reunited in 2012 and released a new song for the compilation album Monsters of Rock USSR: XX Years Later.\n\nIn the mid 2000s, permission was obtained to reissue the extremely obscure 'Krovoyzliyanie' album on CD (it had originally been released in very limited numbers on tape and vinyl). The album was remastered for the CD format and co-released November 2007 through ant[ICON] Laboratories and Stigmartyr Records. Available via: http://www.stigmartyrrecords.com/\n\nThe band is signed to ant[ICON] Laboratories and Stigmartyr Records.\n\n1. Intro\n2. It Came [Aspid]\n3. Towards One Goal\n4.
