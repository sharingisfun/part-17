Meet feisty Mary Ruth, the young woman who prefers her independence to conformity, Steve who gave up long ago on finding love, and little Katie who makes a new friend in Melvin, a friendship that has the potential to grow into something more. As Amish do not use computers or cell phones to communicate, Amish women will often write circle letters, letters that they send to a list of addresses of people that they would like to include in the correspondence. Since they do not have access to photocopiers, the first person on the list will receive the letter, read it, and respond. That person sends both the first letter and their response to the second name on the list. This continues until the entire package of letters goes full-circle, returning to the original sender. An Amish Christian Romance that will leave you breathless and wanting more. Sarah Price, bestselling author of Amish Christian Romances, brings her twenty-five years of experience living among the Amish and from growing up Mennonite to the pages of her novels and novellas, in order to present a truly authentic Amish experience just for her readers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9738362a41cd8ac6e416bdcdfcfca3e5d8335167","amp;dn":"Amish+Circle+Letters+I+-+Sarah+Price","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9738362a41cd8ac6e416bdcdfcfca3e5d8335167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,56,54,42,65,205,138,198,228,22,189,205,252,252,163,229,216,51,81,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
