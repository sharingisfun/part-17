Its capabilities are well documented, and it is a time proven design, Google it if you don't believe me. The boiler is seperate from the distillation column for better heat control.\n\nIt is easily setup to be nearly a fully automated still, and can also be easily setup to run on a continuous boiler.\n\nOutput rate is up to ~20L/hr @ 96%abv using a 3&quot; column. I can build this still using either a 3&quot; body or 6&quot; body. \n\n\nRS_jenssen\nwww.brygging.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:987ae532e9fdf239a3d9ae7acc40ff11442fccbe","amp;dn":"Charles+803+continuous+reflux+design+plans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"987ae532e9fdf239a3d9ae7acc40ff11442fccbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,122,229,50,233,253,242,57,163,217,174,122,204,64,255,17,68,47,204,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
