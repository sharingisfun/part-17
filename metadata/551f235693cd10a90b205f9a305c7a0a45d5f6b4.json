It was released on November 14, 1998, and charted at number 20 on The Billboard 200. The compilation featured two newly recorded songs: &quot;Enslaved&quot; and the single &quot;Bitter Pill&quot; which charted at number 22 on the Mainstream rock charts. Tommy Lee recorded his drum tracks for the album's two new songs, and then started a prison sentence of five months. Additionally, a remix version of &quot;Glitter&quot; is included. The tour for the album began after Lee's release from prison. It would be his last with the band before his return in 2004.\n\nThe album is an updated version of the original compilation Decade of Decadence released in 1991. The cover features a caricature of the band by Mad magazine artist Mort Drucker.\n\nThe compilation won a 1998 Metal Edge Readers' Choice Award for &quot;Best Compilation.&quot;\n\nThis compilation also misses out on some other hits from Motley Crue Such as Live Wire Piece Of Your Action and Too Young To Fall In Love.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_%281998_M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe_album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_%281998_M%C3%B6tley_Cr%C3%BCe_album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/M%C3%B6tley-Cr%C3%BCe-Greatest-Hits/release/1769417&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/M%C3%B6tley-Cr%C3%BCe-Greatest-Hits/release/1769417&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:551f235693cd10a90b205f9a305c7a0a45d5f6b4","amp;dn":"M%26ouml%3Btley+Cr%26uuml%3Be+-+Greatest+Hits+%5BV2%5D+1998","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"551f235693cd10a90b205f9a305c7a0a45d5f6b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,31,35,86,147,205,16,169,11,32,95,154,48,92,122,10,69,213,246,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
