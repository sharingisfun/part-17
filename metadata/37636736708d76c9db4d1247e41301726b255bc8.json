Black Beauty, the automotive star of the cliff-hanging Ã¢â‚¬Å“Green HornetÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ movie serial of the 1940s, scorched Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles as the car of the series' masked hero.\n\n The Black Beauty conceptualized it all. Presenting the car to Britt Reid, the series crime-fighting hero, in the opening episode, his valet and chauffeur, Kato, explains the modifications made to the 267-cubic-inch V-12 engine. In stock form, it produced 110 horsepower, but Kato's 'chemical energizer' transformed the ZephyrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerplant into &quot;the strongest motor ever built Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the fastest.&quot; The energizer delivers on-demand urge.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What'll she do?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Reid asks.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Better than 200,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kato says. \n\nSYNOPSIS:- The Green Hornet (1940) \nNewspaper publisher Britt Reid, secretly The Green Hornet, and his Korean valet Kato investigate and expose several seemingly separate rackets. This leads them into continued conflict with the Leader, the criminal mastermind behind the Syndicate and the individual crimes.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 4:18:0\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 4:18:00\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37636736708d76c9db4d1247e41301726b255bc8","amp;dn":"The+Green+Hornet+%281940%29+Xvid+-+Theatrical+Serial+-+All+13+Chapte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37636736708d76c9db4d1247e41301726b255bc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,99,103,54,112,141,118,201,219,77,18,71,228,19,1,114,107,37,91,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
