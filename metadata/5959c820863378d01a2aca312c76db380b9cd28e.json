The album solidifies The\nDecemberists' standing as one of the most innovative\ncreative forces in music today. They will debut the\nalbum live in its entirely at SXSW in March.\nLavender Diamond's Becky Stark and My Brightest\nDiamond's Shara Worden deliver the lead vocals for\nthe female characters, while My Morning Jacket's Jim\nJames, Robyn Hitchcock and the Spinanes' Rebecca\nGates appear in supporting roles.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5959c820863378d01a2aca312c76db380b9cd28e","amp;dn":"The_Decemberists-The_Hazards_Of_Love-2009-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5959c820863378d01a2aca312c76db380b9cd28e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,89,200,32,134,51,120,208,26,42,202,49,44,118,219,56,11,156,210,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
