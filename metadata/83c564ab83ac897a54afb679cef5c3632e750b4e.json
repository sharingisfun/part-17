In Seeing Voices, Oliver Sacks turns his attention to the subject of deafness, and the result is a deeply felt portrait of a minority struggling for recognition and respect - a minority with its own rich, sometimes astonishing, culture and unique visual language, an extraordinary mode of communication that tells us much about the basis of language in hearing people as well. Seeing Voices is, as Studs Terkel has written, &quot;an exquisite, as well as revelatory, work&quot;.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Some changes have been made to the original manuscript with the permission of Oliver Sacks.\n\nÃ‚Â©1989, 1990 Oliver Sacks (P)2011 Audible, Inc.\nWhat the Critics Say\n\n&quot;This book will shake your preconceptions about the deaf, about language and about thoughtÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Sacks [is] one of the finest and most thoughtful writers of our time.&quot; (Los Angeles Times Book Review)\n\n&quot;Fascinating and richly rewardingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. Sacks is a profoundly wise observer.&quot; (The Plain Dealer)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83c564ab83ac897a54afb679cef5c3632e750b4e","amp;dn":"Oliver+Sacks+-+Seeing+Voices+-+A+Journey+Into+the+World+of+the+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83c564ab83ac897a54afb679cef5c3632e750b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,197,100,171,131,172,137,122,84,175,182,121,206,245,195,99,46,117,11,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
