The course explains the key foundational concepts, such as polygons, textures, and rays, that are crucial to understanding exactly how this 3D application functions. It also includes practical techniques for creating, selecting, and transforming objects, working with splines, polygonal modeling, and adding materials, lighting, and camera views for a fully realized 3D image. Exercise files are included with the course.\n\nTopics include:\n\nExploring the importance of object hierarchy\nModeling with splines\nModeling with the Knife and Extrude tools\nApplying materials and texturing\nCreating and manipulating light sources\nAnimating in the timeline with keyframes\nControlling camera movement\nCompositing in After Effects\nTexturing with BodyPaint\nUsing XPresso and MoGraph\nCreating particle systems\nRendering and adjusting final render settings\n\nADOBE AFTER EFFECTS CS5;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5565855&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5565855&lt;/a&gt;\n\nADOBE AFTER EFFECTS CS5 IN ADOBE CREATIVE SUITE 5 PRODUCTION PREMIUM;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5649900&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5649900&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTO USE .iso FILES DOWNLOAD THIS;   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5e1ec53d1975f93dac54ca552b77434b9e5b38f","amp;dn":"LYNDA.COM+-+CINEMA+4D+R12+ESSENTIAL+TRAINING+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5e1ec53d1975f93dac54ca552b77434b9e5b38f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,225,236,83,209,151,95,147,218,197,76,165,82,183,116,52,185,229,179,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
