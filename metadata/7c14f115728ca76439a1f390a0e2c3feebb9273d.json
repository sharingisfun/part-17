Fabrizio Grossi (Whips &amp; Roses I &amp; II, Glenn Hughes) was also on board as Associate Producer/Mix Engineer. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been inspiring to learn that all of these legendary guitarists are all fans of Tommy, and were excited to add parts to original Tommy Bolin multitrack tapes that have never been made public.\n\nGregÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sessions with Steve Lukather were especially poignant, as the drummer on that original multitrack was the late Jeff Porcaro with whom Lukather played in Toto. Contributing musicians listed in the order in which the sessions were completed include:\n\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Steve Lukather (Toto, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Warren Haynes (GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mule, Allman Brothers)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Brad Whitford (Aerosmith)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Nels Cline (Wilco, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Glenn Hughes (Trapeze, Deep Purple, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Oz Noy (Roger Glover, Nile Rodgers, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ John Scofield (Billy Cobham, Miles Davis, Jaco Pastorius, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Prairie Prince (The Tubes, drums on Savannah Woman and Wild Dogs)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Peter Frampton (Humble Pie, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Joe Bonamassa (Black Country Communion, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Steve Morse (Deep Purple, Dixie Dregs, solo)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Derek Trucks (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Derek Trucks Band, Allman Brothers)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Sonny Landreth (Solo, John Hiatt)\n    Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Big Sugar\n\nTRACKLIST [320k MP3]\n\nDISC 1\n\t  \t \nThe Grind \t  \tPeter Frampton\nTeaser \t  \t        Warren Haynes\nDreamer \t  \tMyles Kennedy and Nels Cline\nSavannah Woman \t  \tJohn Scofield\nSmooth Fandango \tDerek Trucks\nPeople People \t  \tBig Sugar and Gordie Johnson\nWild Dogs \t  \tBrad Whitford\nHomeward Strut \t  \tSteve Lukather\nSugar Shack \t  \tGlenn Hughes and Sonny Landreth\nCrazed Fandango \tSteve Morse\nLotus \t  \t        Joe Bonamassa, Glenn Hughes and Nels Cline\n\t\t\n\nDISC 2 Bonus CD\n\t  \t \nFlying Fingers  \t                Oz Noy and Nels Cline\n\nMarching Bag Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Movement One \t  \tNels Cline, Bolin, Greg Hampton, John Scofield, Sonny Landreth\n\nMarching Bag Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Movement Two \t  \tNels Cline, Bolin, Steve Lukather, Derek Trucks, Peter Frampton\n\nMarching Bag Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Movement Three \t  \tGordie Johnson, Bolin, Nels Cline, Oz Noy, Steve Lukather, Steve Morse, Joe Bonamassa\n\nMarching Bag Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Movement Four \t  \tNels Cline, Bolin, Warren Haynes, Joe Bonamassa, Oz Noy, Brad Whitford, Peter Frampton","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c14f115728ca76439a1f390a0e2c3feebb9273d","amp;dn":"Tommy+Bolin+-+Great+Gypsy+Soul+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c14f115728ca76439a1f390a0e2c3feebb9273d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,20,241,21,114,140,167,100,57,161,243,144,160,226,195,254,235,185,39,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
