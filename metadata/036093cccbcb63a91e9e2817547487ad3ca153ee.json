I think the intention was for listeners to have &quot;a late night program of mellow instrumental music&quot; to be lulled to sleep.  I have searched Pirate Bay for this music to no avail.  I'm trying to get my hands on the different volumes and as I do, I'll upload them if there seems to be interest.  Enjoy.  \n\n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nKINK, also kink.fm, is an American commercial broadcast FM radio station in Portland, Oregon. The station began broadcasting Christmas Day, 1968 as ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£KINK ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ The Underground LinkÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥. Although KINKÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s format has evolved over the years, its sound, philosophy, target audience, marketing, and community involvement have remained fundamentally consistent over its forty year history, a rarity in commercial broadcasting. Many of KINKÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s DJs have been associated with the station for decades, also a rarity in the industry. In the vernacular of commercial radio, KINK is known as a ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£heritageÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ radio station.\n\nKINK plays a wide variety of music, including adult album alternative, rock, acoustic, folk, pop, blues, reggae and new age. KINK's format also features many special programs, some of which have been in place for many years. These include Lights Out(canceled), a late night program of mellow instrumental music that began in 1973, the Sunday Night Blues Room, Sunday Acoustic KINK, and Tranceformation, a weekly selection of trance and chill music. KINK showcases emerging artists from the Portland, Oregon area with its nightly Local Music Spotlight feature, as well as independent or unsigned artists with its nightly feature The Gamut.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:036093cccbcb63a91e9e2817547487ad3ca153ee","amp;dn":"Kink+Lights+Out+Vol+7+-+Mellow%2C+instrumental+music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"036093cccbcb63a91e9e2817547487ad3ca153ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,96,147,204,203,203,99,169,30,158,40,23,84,116,135,173,60,161,83,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
