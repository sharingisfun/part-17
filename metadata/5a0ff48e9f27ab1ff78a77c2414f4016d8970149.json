Food has arguably never been more affordable as some stores try to tempt us in with four pints of milk for under a pound and whole chickens for just Ã‚Â£2.50. Two thirds of families now say price and convenience are the main factors behind where they choose to shop. But what might be the consequences for us and our country's growers and producers?\r\nTonight's Jonathan Maitland speaks to the farmers who say they're fighting for survival and to a health expert concerned about the risk of infection in large-scale production. Our reporter joins the Potts family from Manchester, who order much of their food online, as they visit a bespoke meat producer in the Lake District. Will this inspire them to shop local and buy British?\r\nFarmers on the brink\r\nThis summer farmers protested at falling prices, one group even taking livestock onto a supermarket aisle. Dairy farmers are some of those who say they're particularly feeling the squeeze.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen0.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen1.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/39/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen2.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen3.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen4.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen5.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/31/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen6.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen7.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen8.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen9.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/77/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen10.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0e/Cheap-Food-What-s-the-Cost-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3119 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 515 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.itv.com/news/2015-10-16/tonight-cheap-food-whats-the-cost/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a0ff48e9f27ab1ff78a77c2414f4016d8970149","amp;dn":"ITV.Tonight.2015.Cheap.Food.Whats.the.Cost.720p.HDTV.x264AAC.MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a0ff48e9f27ab1ff78a77c2414f4016d8970149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,15,244,142,159,39,171,31,247,138,119,194,65,79,64,22,216,151,1,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
