There, she meets Edward Cullen and his family, who possess an other-worldly and irresistible beauty and grace to which Bella is drawn. Twilight is the tale of Bella and Edward's burgeoning relationship, brimming with standard teenage drama alongside the unexpected, because, after all, Edward and his family are vampires. These undead friends have chosen to deny their urge to drink human blood, instead slaking their thirst with the blood of animals. Bella soon finds out, however, that not all vampires in her life are constrained by such scruples.\n\nThe book has been praised for its treatment of sexuality and morality. Although there's plenty of yearning and sensuality, there is no sex, drinking, or drug use. Edward refuses Bella's desire to be turned into a vampire herself, on grounds that it wouldn't be the right thing to do.\n\nTwilight is an easy and enjoyable read. Its first-person viewpoint keeps the the pages turning. This isn't a masterpiece of literary achievement, however. You have to take it for what it is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- a unique and entertaining, if not flawlessly written, story. Twilight will almost certainly appeal to teenage girls and many women of all ages, but probably not to the majority of males. It's sure to make readers eager to devour the next three novels. \n\n\n\n\nit's a twilight thing you wouldn't understand\n\nplease seed!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17ac04faf04ca98e03497d69f67b4aed5796ce5","amp;dn":"twilight+complete+saga+ebook+for+mobile+phones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17ac04faf04ca98e03497d69f67b4aed5796ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,122,192,79,175,4,202,152,224,52,151,214,159,103,180,174,213,121,108,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
