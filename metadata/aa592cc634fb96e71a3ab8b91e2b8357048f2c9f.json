Although the blues feeling (as pointed out in the liner notes) is emphasized throughout the date, many of the songs, including &quot;The Brown Skin Gal in the Calico Gown&quot; and &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; are not really blues, but only bluesy. Overall this is a fine outing, but this LP has been out of print for a couple of decades.
