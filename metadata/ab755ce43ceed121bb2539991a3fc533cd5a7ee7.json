Pavlov&amp;#039;s Dog originally comprised David Surkamp (vocals and guitar), Steve Scorfina (lead guitar), Mike Safron (drums), Rick Stockton (bass guitar), David Hamilton (keyboard), Doug Rayburn (mellotron and flute), and Siegfried Carver (born Richard Nadler) (various string instruments including the rare vitar, a cross between a guitar and a violin). Carver left the band after the first album. On their second album At the Sound of the Bell (1976), Tom Nickeson was added to the line-up on guitar and he took over Hamilton&amp;#039;s keyboard position after the album had been recorded as Hamilton left the band. Safron was still a member of the band but did not appear on the second album, former Yes drummer Bill Bruford played as a guest musician. Safron left in the aftermath of this, partially due to his failure to receive a promised credit on the album sleeve and the band&amp;#039;s third album featured Kirk Sarkisian on drums. \nPavlov&amp;#039;s Dog broke up in 1978. Surkamp and Rayburn re-formed the band briefly in the late &amp;#039;80s with an otherwise new lineup, releasing the album Lost in America in 1990. Surkamp continues to play solo gigs around the St. Louis area.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlov%27s_Dog_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlov%27s_Dog_(band)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMembers:\nDavid Surkamp - Lead Vokal, Gitar \nDavid Hamilton - Keyboards \nDoug Rayburn - Mellotron, FlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼t \nMike Safron ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vurmalilar\nRick Stockton - Bass gitar\nSiegfried Carver - Violin, Vitar, Viola\nSteve Scorfina - Lead Gitar \n\nDiscography:\n1974 Pampered Menial \n1975 The At The Sound of the Bell\n1976 Live-Detroit, Michigan 14.05.1976\n1977 Third\n1990 Lost In America\n1995 End Of The World-EP\n2007 Has Anyone Here Seen Siegfried?\n\n\nAlbums taken from different websites","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab755ce43ceed121bb2539991a3fc533cd5a7ee7","amp;dn":"Pavlov%5C%27s+Dog+-+Discography+%281974-2007%29+%5Bmp3%40192-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab755ce43ceed121bb2539991a3fc533cd5a7ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,117,92,228,60,238,209,33,187,37,57,153,26,63,197,51,205,90,126,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
