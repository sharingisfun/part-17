Later on they were also shown to the general U.S. public to persuade them to support American involvement in the war.\nMost of the films were directed by Frank Capra, who was daunted yet also impressed and challenged by Leni Riefenstahl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s propaganda film Triumph of the Will and who worked in direct response to it. The series faced a tough challenge: convincing an only recently non-interventionist nation of the need to become involved in the war and ally with the Soviets, among other things. In many of the films, Capra and other directors spliced in Axis powers propaganda footage going back twenty years, and recontextualized it so it promoted the cause of the Allies.\nWhy We Fight was edited primarily by William Hornbeck, although some parts were re-enacted \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;under War Department supervision\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; if there was no relevant footage available. The animated portions of the films were produced by the Disney studios ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with the animated maps following a convention of depicting Axis-occupied territory in black.\n\nSeeding 24/7/365\n\n\nAlso you can download \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;The Unknown War\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;.
