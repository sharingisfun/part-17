Share the gift of music.\n\nNote:\nUnfortunately me and my pal torrentino were late to the show which is why the first song cuts in. After the first song we had to move to another seat since we took the wrong one at our first attempt. So you can hear the security guy mumble a few german words into the the mic but all in all it's not too distracting. From then on it was smooth sailing. Enjoy the music! I certainly did.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:777973da7412bf9a1ac5a9a2c82eafc7ac1ed2bb","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+2013-10-06+Lanxess+Arena%2C+Cologne%2C+Germany+AUD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"777973da7412bf9a1ac5a9a2c82eafc7ac1ed2bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,121,115,218,116,18,191,154,26,197,169,162,200,46,175,199,172,30,210,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
