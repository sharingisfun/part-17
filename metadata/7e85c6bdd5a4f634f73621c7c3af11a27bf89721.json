Modern production techniques for medium to large series products or mass production usually involve assembly conveyor lines. The aim is to have monotonous and similar in type operations or such causing fatigue, stress and production traumas, gradually replaced by automated assembly cycles, means and techniques. Assembly alternatives involving automation, and mechanisation, programmable and adaptive control have been in addition analyzed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e85c6bdd5a4f634f73621c7c3af11a27bf89721","amp;dn":"Automation+and+Robotics+-+%7BCHB+Books%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e85c6bdd5a4f634f73621c7c3af11a27bf89721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,133,198,189,213,164,246,52,247,54,33,199,195,175,17,162,123,248,151,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
