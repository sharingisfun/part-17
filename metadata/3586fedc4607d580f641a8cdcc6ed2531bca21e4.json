Disturbing in ways it is difficult to point a finger at.  This film was (and might still be) banned in Vietnam. The atmosphere is accurate and quite shocking (no, I haven't lived in the underbelly of Ho Chi Minh City, but somewhere close to it).\n\nThough Anh Hung Tran's other films are quite beautiful, they lack the storyline and the power of this one.\n\n\nUncompressed Chinese NTSC VIDEO_TS folder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3586fedc4607d580f641a8cdcc6ed2531bca21e4","amp;dn":"Anh+Hung+Tran+-+Xich+lo%2FCyclo+-+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3586fedc4607d580f641a8cdcc6ed2531bca21e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,134,254,220,70,7,213,128,246,65,168,205,204,110,210,83,27,202,33,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
