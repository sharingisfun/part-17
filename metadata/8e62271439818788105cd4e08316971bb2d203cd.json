The country comparison is made because of all the songs about heartache, loneliness, infidelity, and romantic disillusionment; the gangsta rap comparison is inspired by all the narco-corridos (corridos about drug trafficking) that los Tigres del Norte, Grupo Exterminador, the late Chalino Sanchez, and others are known for. And narco-corridos are a high priority on Jefe de Jefes (Boss of Bosses), which went down in history as one of the most essential Tigres albums of the '90s. This 1997 release (a two-CD set that sold over one million copies in the United States alone) was controversial; some Mexicans have accused narco-corridos of glorying the drug trade. But there is nothing on this album that paints drug trafficking in a favorable light -- quite the contrary. &quot;Las Novias del Traficante,&quot; &quot;El Dolor de un Padre,&quot; and other gems make it clear that los Tigres see drug trafficking for exactly what it is: a plague and a cancer. However, they aren't preachy or whiny about it; humor, in fact, is a prime ingredient on Jefe de Jefes, but the fact that los Tigres use humor to their artistic advantage doesn't mean that they're making light of a very serious and tragic problem. Not everything on Jefe de Jefes is about drug trafficking, and los Tigres are equally compelling when they write about other subjects -- for example, the Mexican immigrant who, on &quot;El Mojado Acaudalado,&quot; misses Mexico despite his financial success in los Estados Unidos. Making this release a two-CD set was a questionable move on Fonovisa's part; the 65 minutes' worth of material would have easily fit on a single disc. Regardless, Jefe de Jefes is an excellent, consistently rewarding effort from this norteÃƒÂ±o powerhouse.\n\n\n01 Jefe De Jefes\n02 El Sucesor\n03 Por Debajo Del Agua\n04 El Dolor De Un Padre\n05 Tambien Las Mujeres Pueden\n06 El Rengro Del Gallo Giro\n07 Carne Quemada\n08 Mis Dos Patrias\n09 El Prisionero\n10 El Mojado\n11 Ni AquÃƒÂ­ Ni AllÃƒÂ¡\n12 El Tarasco\n13 La Paloma\n14 Jesus Amado\n15 Lo Que Sembre Alla En La Sierra\n16 El Planton\n17 Las Novias Del Traficante\n18 El General\n19 El Mojado Acaudalado (AcÃƒÂºstico)\n\n\nArtiste: Los Tigres Del Norte\nFile Type: Mp3 Audio\nAudio Format: MPEG Layer-3\nRelease Date: 1997 - 2012\nRecord Label: Fonovisa\nGenre: Latin\nStyle: Mexican Traditions, Norteno, Tejano, Latin Pop\nPlaying Time: 01hr 05min 54secs\nEngineer: James Dean\nBiltrate: 256kbps\nBit Depth: 16 bit\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Sample Rate: 44kHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e62271439818788105cd4e08316971bb2d203cd","amp;dn":"Los+Tigres+Del+Norte.1997-2012.JEFE+DE+JEFES%5BMp3%5D.256Kbps.-ROSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e62271439818788105cd4e08316971bb2d203cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,98,39,20,57,129,135,136,16,92,212,224,131,22,151,27,178,210,3,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
