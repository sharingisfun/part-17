However, when analyzing high-wage, education-intensive occupations, this cohort are not as prevalent as the non-minority population. What accounts for this discrepancy? How far does ethnicity affect one's occupational opportunities? What does this tangibly mean with respect to the management of urban ethnic differences? And, what steps can we take to improve this situation? Drawing upon the latest statistics and detailed interviews, this book examines the experiences of ethnic minorities from schooling to the job search, hiring, and promotion processes.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nReza Hasmath (PhD, Cambridge) is a Lecturer in Chinese Politics at the University of Oxford. He has worked for various think-tanks, development agencies, and NGOs in Canada, USA, UK, Australia and China, and was previously based at the Universities of Toronto and Melbourne. His current research can be summarized in threefold: (1) examining the education and labour market experiences of ethnic minorities in the Canadian, American, Australian and Chinese contexts; (2) assessing the theories and practices of international development, and differential treatment in international society; and, (3) analyzing evolving state-NGO relationships in China, and its policy-specific implications. \n\n\nHardcover: 206 pages\nPublisher: Palgrave Macmillan; 1 edition (June 8, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0230100384\nISBN-13: 978-0230100381\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Comparative-Study-Minority-Development-Canada/dp/0230100384/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Comparative-Study-Minority-Development-Canada/dp/0230100384/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTags: race, racism, disparity, ethnic, ethnicity, minority, asian studies, american studies, China, Canada, PRC, society, culture, company, economy, job, hiring, HR, Law , Legal Theory &amp; Systems ,Non-US Legal Systems, Social Sciences, Anthropology, Political Science, Government, International Relations, Politics &amp; Social, Sciences, Anthropology, Cultural, Politics , Government , International, World, Politics ,Canadian, Comparative, Politics, Human Rights\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea9c95f4417f06c765313734e98dc43dd1471d74","amp;dn":"A+Comparative+Study+of+Minority+Development+in+China+and+Canada+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea9c95f4417f06c765313734e98dc43dd1471d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,156,149,244,65,127,6,199,101,49,55,52,233,141,196,61,209,71,29,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
