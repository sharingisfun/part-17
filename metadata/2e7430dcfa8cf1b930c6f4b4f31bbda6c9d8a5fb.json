The key to ESI's success is the use of realistic material physics, providing &quot;as good as real&quot; virtual solutions, in order to replace the lengthy trial and error processes on real prototypes.\n\nESI has developed an extensive suite of coherent, industry-oriented applications to realistically simulate a productÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s behavior during testing and real life use; to refine manufacturing processes for desired product performance, and to evaluate the effect of the environment in which the product is deployed.\n\nESIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s products represent a unique collaborative and open environment for End-to-End Virtual Prototyping, thus eliminating the need for physical prototypes during product development. This solution allows a productivity gain, innovation acceleration and significantly reduced costs.\n\nThe company employs over 750 high-level specialists worldwide covering more than 30 countries.\n\nAs ESI Group development is based on continuous innovation, the company is qualified as Ã¢â‚¬Å“innovative companyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by OSEO, a French innovation agency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e7430dcfa8cf1b930c6f4b4f31bbda6c9d8a5fb","amp;dn":"ESI+ProCAST+2011.0+for+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e7430dcfa8cf1b930c6f4b4f31bbda6c9d8a5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,116,48,220,250,140,241,185,48,198,244,180,243,27,189,166,201,216,165,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
