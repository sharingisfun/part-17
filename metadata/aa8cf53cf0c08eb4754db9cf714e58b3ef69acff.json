From the first ever RAF bombing raid of World War 2, to hunting submarines over treacherous waters, to clandestine troop deployments behind enemy lines the Wellington became one of the great success stories of Anglo-Allied operations.\n\nThe Wellington offers one of the most realistic recreations ever to grace a desktop simulation. The highly distinctive lines of the fuselage are supplemented by a raft of custom animations that offer an unprecedented depth of realism. With an authentic cockpit layout, and precision handling amid the roar of the mighty engines, aviation history bursts into dramatic life.\n\nTo compliment the Wellington we also include additional scenery for RAF Driffield, circa 1941, home to the finest Wellington Squadrons. Aspiring Wellington crews are also requested to assemble in the briefing room ahead of embarking on a series challenging FSX missions that will test both pilot and aircraft to the limit.\nThe amalgam of this lavishly detailed aircraft, period scenery and breathtaking missions come together to relive the unforgettable experience of the glory days of the Wellington.\n\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator X or FS2004\nWindows XP or Vista\n1GB Hard disk space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa8cf53cf0c08eb4754db9cf714e58b3ef69acff","amp;dn":"FSX+-+FS9+-+First+Class+Simulations+-+Wellington","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa8cf53cf0c08eb4754db9cf714e58b3ef69acff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,140,245,60,240,192,142,180,117,77,185,207,113,78,88,179,239,105,172,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
