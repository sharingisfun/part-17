Using 1972-1975 solo material this attempts to create a 1975 Beatles album that fits on a single CD or double vinyl LP.\n\nDON'T LET ME WAIT TOO LONG (total time = 79:55)\n01  Band On The Run  5:10  (Paul)\n02  Mind Games  4:10  (John)\n03  Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)  3:34  (George)\n04  Listen To What The Man Said  3:54  (Paul)\n05  #9 Dream  4:45  (John)\n06  You  3:42  (George)\n07  Jet  4:06  (Paul)\n08  Out The Blue  3:21  (John)\n09  Photograph  3:57  (Ringo)\n10  Live And Let Die  3:11  (Paul)\n11  Stand By Me  3:25  (John)\n12  Dark Horse  3:53  (George)\n13  Juniors Farm  4:21  (Paul)\n14  No-No Song  2:30  (Ringo)\n15  Don't Let Me Wait Too Long  2:54  (George)\n16  Let Me Roll It  4:45  (Paul)\n17  I know (I Know)  3:47  (John)\n18  My Love  4:08  (Paul)\n19  Ding Dong, Ding Dong  3:39  (George)\n20  Hi, Hi, Hi  3:08  (Paul)\n21  Whatever Gets You Through The Night  3:26  (John)\n\n\nTHE BEATLES - That Would Be Something FLAC  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10556807/THE_BEATLES_-_That_Would_Be_Something_FLAC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10556807/THE_BEATLES_-_That_Would_Be_Something_FLAC&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:642ba9fb7203190e8a82751d671d0a66e29d4b44","amp;dn":"THE+BEATLES+-+Don%27t+Let+Me+Wait+Too+Long+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"642ba9fb7203190e8a82751d671d0a66e29d4b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,43,169,251,114,3,25,14,138,130,117,29,103,29,10,102,226,157,75,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
