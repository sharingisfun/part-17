The Rifftrax for R.O.T.O.R. is 1h27m56s long while the Blu-Ray is 1h30m17s. For this remaster, the movie only audio track was used for the sections not included in the original Rifftrax release. While every effort was made to match the volumes and make the transitions smooth, the Blu-Ray audio track is much, much cleaner than the Rifftrax so the transitions may be noticeable. Here is a list of the Blu-Ray audio with no riffs:\r\n0.06.53-0.07.13\r\n0.07.42-0.07.55\r\n0.12.04-0.12.58\r\n0.15.09-0.16.07\r\n0.20.06-0.20.47\r\n0.32.55-0.33.34\r\n0.39.05-0.39.25\r\n\r\nIn addition to fitting the Rifftrax to the longer Blu-Ray, the Rifftrax audio track was compressed slightly to reduce the riff commentary a few dbs. While a complete volume re-balance is not possible since there isn't a pure commentary track to process with a pure movie track, this compression helped bring the riffs a little closer in volume to the movie sound.\r\n\r\nThe video source was a Blu-Ray rip encoded to AVC 8893Kbps. This video was re-encoded to AVC 2300Kbps 2-pass (turbo first pass) with almost identical quality. This encode is much better looking than some DVD encodes and vastly superior to the very poor video included with the Rifftrax release.\r\n\r\nBoth English and English SDH subs are included. Plus, custom named chapters are included with this share:\r\nCh01 Robotic Officer Tactical Operation Research\r\nCh02 Tactical Operations Lab   \r\nCh03 Cold Iron Is Fired\r\nCh04 ROTOR Is Born\r\nCh05 He's A Crazy Cop\r\nCh06 Justice Rampage\r\nCh07 To Judge And Execute\r\nCh08 End Credits\r\n\r\nBig thanks to the posters of the 1080p/2.0 encode of the movie and the subs. A very special thanks to a community member who did a remaster of the Rifftrax audio and the widescreen DVD video. This audio track was extremely helpful in creating the newly remastered Rifftrax 2.0 track for this share.
