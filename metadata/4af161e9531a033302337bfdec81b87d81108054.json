My birth certificate lists my name as Calliope Helen Stephanides. My most recent driverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license...records my first name simply as Cal.&quot;\n\nSo begins the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City, and the race riots of l967, before they move out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Pointe, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, Middlesex is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.\n \nMiddlesex is the winner of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\n\nAbout the Author :-\n\n\neffrey Eugenides was born in Detroit and attended Brown and Stanford Universities. His first novel, The Virgin Suicides, was published by Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux to great acclaim in 1993, and he has received numerous awards for his work.\n\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af161e9531a033302337bfdec81b87d81108054","amp;dn":"Middlesex%3A+A+Novel+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af161e9531a033302337bfdec81b87d81108054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,241,97,233,83,26,3,51,2,51,123,253,236,129,184,125,129,16,128,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
