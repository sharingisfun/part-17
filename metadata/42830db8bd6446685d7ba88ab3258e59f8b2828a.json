It's as if French director Jacques Perrin and his international crew of dedicated filmmakers had been given a full-access pass by Mother Nature herself, with the complete &quot;cooperation&quot; of countless species of migrating birds, all answering to eons of migratory instinct. The film is utterly simple in purpose, with minimal narration and on-screen titles to identify the wondrous varieties of flying wildlife, but its visceral effect is humbling, awesome and magnificently profound. Technically, Perrin surpasses the achievement of his earlier film Microcosmos (which did for insects what this film does for birds), and apart from a few digital skyscapes for poetic effect, this astonishing film uses no special effects whatsoever, with soaring, seemingly miraculous camera work that blesses the viewer with, quite literally, a bird's-eye view. A brief but important hunting scene may upset sensitive viewers and children, but doesn't stop Winged Migration from being essential all-ages viewing.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/1017/wingedmigrationscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/1017/wingedmigrationscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4990/wingedmigrationscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img3.imageshack.us/img3/4990/wingedmigrationscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3138/wingedmigrationscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/3138/wingedmigrationscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2884/wingedmigrationscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2884/wingedmigrationscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6523/wingedmigrationscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6523/wingedmigrationscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/859/wingedmigrationscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/859/wingedmigrationscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img535.imageshack.us/img535/2019/wingedmigrationscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img535.imageshack.us/img535/2019/wingedmigrationscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9951/wingedmigrationscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9951/wingedmigrationscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/8990/wingedmigrationscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/8990/wingedmigrationscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1499 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 90.Mins\n * Number Of Parts:1\n * Part Size: 1.01 GB (1,044 MB)\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Technical Specs for The Making of\n \n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sonyclassics.com/wingedmigration/home.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sonyclassics.com/wingedmigration/home.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42830db8bd6446685d7ba88ab3258e59f8b2828a","amp;dn":"Winged+Migration+1of2+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42830db8bd6446685d7ba88ab3258e59f8b2828a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,131,13,184,189,100,70,104,93,123,168,138,179,37,142,89,248,178,130,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
