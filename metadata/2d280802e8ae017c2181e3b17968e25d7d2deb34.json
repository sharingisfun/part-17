Over the course of a three hour period, a computer program designed by Stephan Moore deconstructed our sounds, randomly recombined their stems into new pieces, and panned the new pieces through a 36 channel surround sound system we installed on the museum lobby's spiral ramp.\n\nYou can download the program, which will perform the audio in a new and unique way each time you run it, and while listening, we encourage you to go into Danny's mind by exploring the images and videos that he created.\n\nEnjoy - AC\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d280802e8ae017c2181e3b17968e25d7d2deb34","amp;dn":"Animal+Collective+-+Transverse+Temporal+Gyrus+-+PLAYER+%28WINDOWS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d280802e8ae017c2181e3b17968e25d7d2deb34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,40,8,2,232,174,1,124,33,129,227,177,121,104,226,93,125,45,235,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
