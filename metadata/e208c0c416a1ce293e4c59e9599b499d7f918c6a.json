Sure they have a similar energy, but think more along the lines of Buckcherry sleaze, Little Caesar blues and Bad Company during their '70s heyday. That recipe looks good on paper but it sounds even better spread across ten scorching hard rock tracks. The Answer may be the current kingpins when it comes to Irish hard rock, but I suggest they don't look in their rear view mirrors because they've already been overtaken by a flock of Screaming Eagles.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e208c0c416a1ce293e4c59e9599b499d7f918c6a","amp;dn":"Screaming+Eagles+-+From+the+Flames+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e208c0c416a1ce293e4c59e9599b499d7f918c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,8,192,196,22,161,206,41,62,76,89,233,89,155,73,157,127,145,140,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
