Mining a garage rock sound often compared to the Strokes, the group formed in 2003 and was named after the bandmembers' favorite dance move. After playing all over New York City and opening for the Walkmen, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and the Fiery Furnaces, Harlem Shakes finally self-released a debut EP, Burning Birthdays, in February 2007. That same month the band toured as support for Deerhoof.
