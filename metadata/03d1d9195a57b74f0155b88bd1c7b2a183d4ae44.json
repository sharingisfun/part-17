Original Coventry rude bwoys, The Specials are to\nreunite for a 2009 30th anniversary tour!\n\nAmazingly, it will be the first time the band - with an almost complete\noriginal line-up - will have played together since 1981. The only\noriginal member not present will be founder member and keyboard\nplayer Jerry Dammers. The lineup will feature: Terry Hall, Neville\nStaple, Sir Horace Gentleman, Roddy Radiation, Lynval Golding and\nJohn Bradbury.\n\n2009 will mark the 30th anniversary of the band signing to Dammers'\n2 Tone label in 1979, and being known as 'The Specials' rather than\nThe Automatics/ The Coventry Automatics/ Special AKA. Their debut\nsingle 'Gangsters' hit the top ten in the same year as did 'A Message\nto you, Rudy', followed by chart-topper 'Too Much, Too Young' the\nfollowing year - all taken from the stunning eponymous debut - itself a\ntop ten hit in the album charts. The last single released by the\nSpecials was the seminal 'Ghost Town' - and what a way to sign-off!\n\nNo doubt, the catalyst for the 30th anniversary tour may well have\nbeen The Beat's 30th anniversary tour - also slated for next year - and\nwhich Specials' man Neville Staple will be performing in at least one\ndate.\n\nThe tour runs from 22nd April to 7th May and includes dates in\nNewcastle, Sheffield, Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and London,\nbut conspicuous with it's absence is the band's hometown of\nCoventry.\n\n\n\n   1.
