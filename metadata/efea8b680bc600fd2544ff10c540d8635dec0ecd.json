Now, as the &quot;Greatest Generation&quot; fades into history, the image of 40,000 uniformed Nazis goose-stepping in perfect synchronization represents all most Americans know about history's most dangerously successful totalitarian government. \n\n\nDig deep beneath the surface of our collective understanding of the Third Reich as HISTORY unearths what we don't know about the individuals who comprised one of the most fascinating and complex regimes of recent history. THIRD REICH: THE RISE AND FALL uncovers familiar anecdotes and fascinating details about the people who comprised the Nazi Party, and raids the treasure trove of archives the Nazis left behind, including rarely-seen German newsreel recordings along with other unique footage carried home by Russian troops.\n\n\nAs produced for The History Channel, this courageous documentary takes an unflinching look at the inner schematics of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. As the program reminds viewers, the Reich was not only one of the most reviled governments in history, but one of the most dizzyingly complex, with a diabolical totalitarian structure that did much to account for its temporary success.\n\n\nThe program travels beyond public comprehension of the Reich, to examine the individuals who comprised it and the secrets that belied it. In the process, it draws heavily from the trove of materials left behind by the Nazis, German newsreel footage, and much more.\n\n\n\n\nWritten by: Nicole Rittenmeyer\n==============================\n\n\nDirected by: Nicole Rittenmeyer &amp; Seth Skundrick\n================================================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................: Third Reich The Rise &amp; Fall\nYear.................: 2010\nGenre................: Documentary \nVideo Length.........: 01:26:27 (  ) 01:29:55 Each\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........: (AC3) \nLanguage.............: English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.: 4:3\n\nVideo Codec..........: XviD \nVideo Resolution.....: 640x480 \nVIdeo Bitrate........: 2700 kbit/s ( ) 2705 kbits\n\n\nSubs.................: (N/A)\nFile Size:...........: 1.62 GB ( ) 1.69 GB\nFPS..................: 29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........: 2 channels\nRelease date.........: 2010\nParts................: 2 Episodes\n\n\n \n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1855924/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1855924/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Episodes:\n    =========\n\n  1)The Rise\n  2)The Fall\n  \n \n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efea8b680bc600fd2544ff10c540d8635dec0ecd","amp;dn":"Third+Reich+The+Rise+And+Fall-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efea8b680bc600fd2544ff10c540d8635dec0ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,234,139,104,11,198,0,253,37,68,255,16,197,64,216,99,93,236,14,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
