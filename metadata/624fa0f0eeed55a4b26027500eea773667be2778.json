Ginell\n\n    If Musicmasters' claim that Freedom Jazz Dance is the last &quot;fully authorized&quot; Eddie Harris studio session is to be believed, what are listeners to make of this baby, which followed the Musicmasters date by nearly a year? Whether authorized or not, Dancing by a Rainbow is actually a better capstone to his studio legacy. Recorded in a reverberant Munich studio, with old '70s cohort Ronald Muldrow back on electric guitar, Nolan Smith on trumpet and flugelhorn, and a strutting rhythm section (electric and acoustic bassist Jeff Chambers, drummer Gaylord Birch), the music-making is hotter, the styles more diverse, and the 60-year-old leader -- who had a little more than a year and a half to live -- is in just as splendidly inventive shape. All the compositions are Harris', nearly half of which are remakes of some of his best, less-often-encored stuff from his heyday in the '60s and early '70s. If anything, this hard-swinging, nearly 13-minute remake of &quot;Mean Greens&quot; is even better than the original, with Muldrow's rhythm guitar serving as the main engine. Harris' solo is a career-encompassing summary of his funk style, and further down on the track he starts comping on piano right in the middle of Chambers' solo -- which has the electrifying effect of driving everyone even harder. &quot;Set Us Free&quot; (originally recorded with Les McCann) goes at a faster, more brittle, percolating tempo, and &quot;Boogie Woogie Bossa Nova&quot; is brighter in tone and funkier in pace. The newer tunes range from truckin' soul-jazz (&quot;The Grand Strut&quot;) through the loose-jointed syncopated funk of the title track, the good-time Brazilian samba &quot;It's Just Fun and Games,&quot; and the more straight-ahead manner that Harris often cultivated in the last years. For old times' sake, Harris also cuts loose a bop-scat vocal on &quot;An April to Be Remembered,&quot; with an occasional reminder of his Leon Thomas-style yodel. Clearly, the Europeans understood Eddie Harris' versatility perfectly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:624fa0f0eeed55a4b26027500eea773667be2778","amp;dn":"Eddie+Harris+-+Dancing+By+A+Rainbow+%5B1995%5D+%28Enja%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"624fa0f0eeed55a4b26027500eea773667be2778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,79,160,240,238,237,85,164,178,96,39,80,14,234,119,54,103,190,39,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
