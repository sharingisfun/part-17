Stephen L. Moore shows how the major general of the new Texas Militia worked around legal constraints in order to keep mounted rangers in service. Expeditions against Indians during 1838 and 1839 were frequent, conducted by militiamen, rangers, cavalry, civilian volunteer groups and the new Frontier Regiment of the Texas Army. From the Surveyors' Fight to the Battle of Brushy Creek, each engagement is covered in new detail. The volume concludes with the Cherokee War of 1839, which saw the assembly of more Texas troops than had engaged the Mexican army at San Jacinto. Moore fully covers the failed peace negotiations, the role of the Texas Rangers in this campaign, and the last stand of heroic Chief Bowles.\n\nThrough extensive use of primary military documents and first-person accounts, Moore provides a clear view of life as a frontier fighter in the Republic of Texas. The reader will find herein numerous and painstakingly recreated muster rolls, as well as a complete list of Texan casualties of the frontier Indian wars from 1835 through 1839.\n\nFor the exacting historian or genealogist of early Texas, the Savage Frontier series will be an indispensable resource on early nineteenth-century Texas frontier violence.\n\n\n# Publisher \tUniversity of North Texas Press (February 14, 2006)\n# Language \tEnglish\n# ISBN-10 \t157441206X\n# ISBN-13 \t978-1574412062","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05a51c7b8c643f6073bf5d06de08775ec95389b","amp;dn":"Savage+Frontier+Volume+II%3A+Rangers%2C+Riflemen%2C+and+Indian+Wars+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c05a51c7b8c643f6073bf5d06de08775ec95389b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,90,81,199,184,198,67,246,7,59,245,208,109,224,135,117,236,149,56,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
