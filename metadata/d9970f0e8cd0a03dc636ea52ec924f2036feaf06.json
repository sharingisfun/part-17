My Fortunes Coming True (Bonus Track) (3:16) \n\nSRC's final album was recorded after the departure of guitarists Gary Quackenbush and Steve Lyman, Ray Goodman assuming all the guitar chores. Despite the shakeup, the sound hardly changed at all, perhaps becoming a bit more progressive-minded. The organ-guitar duels and alternation of concise hard rock with lengthy progressive passages also remained intact. If this album came out today, you'd swear it was a satire of the progressive rock era, some of it is so prototypical. But these guys were serious about what they did, and impressive, in their own way. The CD reissue includes a non-LP B-side from the same era, &quot;My Fortune's Coming True.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9970f0e8cd0a03dc636ea52ec924f2036feaf06","amp;dn":"SRC+-+Traveler%27s+Tale+%281970%2F1993%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9970f0e8cd0a03dc636ea52ec924f2036feaf06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,151,15,14,140,208,160,61,198,54,234,82,236,146,79,32,54,254,175,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
