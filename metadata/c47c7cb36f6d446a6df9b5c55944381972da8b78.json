It reviews the most commonly-made errors in speaking, reading, and writing Spanish. The authors focus on tricky vocabulary, idioms, technical terms, and other details in Spanish grammar and usage that differ markedly from English. This newly updated edition has been given an attractive new layout and cover design with type in a second color to emphasize keys points, as well as a larger page count. Students will also find more examples and exercises with answer keys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c47c7cb36f6d446a6df9b5c55944381972da8b78","amp;dn":"1001+Pitfalls+in+Spanish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c47c7cb36f6d446a6df9b5c55944381972da8b78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,124,124,179,111,109,68,106,109,249,181,197,89,68,56,25,114,218,139,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
