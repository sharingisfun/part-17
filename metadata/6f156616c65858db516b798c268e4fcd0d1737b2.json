Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while townfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod. Herod is also the owner, leader, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“rulerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the town. Seems heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ even if it gets someone killed Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114214/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114214/&lt;/a&gt;\nRelease Date: 10 February 1995 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Thriller | Western\nStars: Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.Bluray.x264-hV\nSize: 800MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f156616c65858db516b798c268e4fcd0d1737b2","amp;dn":"The+Quick+and+the+Dead+%281995%29+BluRay+720p+800MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f156616c65858db516b798c268e4fcd0d1737b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,21,102,22,198,88,88,219,81,107,121,140,38,142,79,205,13,23,55,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
