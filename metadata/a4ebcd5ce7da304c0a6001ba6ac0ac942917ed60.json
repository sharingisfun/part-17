After diminishing in popularity by the mid-1980s, the band created a major comeback in 1985 experiencing further success with their power ballads throughout the rest of the decade. By the mid-1990s, Heart left their 1980s&amp;#039; sound and went back to their hard rock roots which they continue to play today. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide.[10]\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1&amp;#039;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\n[b]These Dreams: Heart&amp;#039;s Greatest Hits[/b] is Heart&amp;#039;s fifteenth album, as well as being their second greatest hits compilation. This compilation features all of Heart&amp;#039;s greatest hits that were released through Capitol Records. Oddly, the tracks: &quot;Crazy On You&quot;, &quot;Magic Man&quot;, &quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot;, &amp; &quot;Heartless&quot; are featured on this album, despite the fact that all four tracks were originally released through Mushroom Records. The reason why they show up here, on a greatest hits album that only features Capitol Records released hits, is that by this time, the rights to Heart&amp;#039;s albums Dreamboat Annie &amp; Magazine had been sold to that of Capitol Records.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Crazy On You&quot; \n2.\t&quot;All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You&quot; \n3.\t&quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; \n4.\t&quot;Never&quot; \n5.\t&quot;Alone&quot; \n6.\t&quot;Who Will You Run To&quot; \n7.\t&quot;Straight On&quot; (Live Acoustic) \n8.\t&quot;Magic Man&quot; \n9.\t&quot;What About Love&quot; \n10.\t&quot;Dreamboat Annie&quot; \n11.\t&quot;Dog &amp; Butterfly&quot; (Live Acoustic) \n12.\t&quot;Nothin&amp;#039; At All&quot; \n13.\t&quot;Heartless&quot; \n14.\t&quot;Stranded&quot; \n15.\t&quot;Will You Be There (In The Morning)&quot; \n16.\t&quot;These Dreams&quot; \n17.\t&quot;Barracuda&quot; (Live) \n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ebcd5ce7da304c0a6001ba6ac0ac942917ed60","amp;dn":"Heart+-+These+Dreams+%28Greatest+Hits%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ebcd5ce7da304c0a6001ba6ac0ac942917ed60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,235,205,92,231,218,48,76,10,96,1,186,106,192,172,148,41,23,237,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
