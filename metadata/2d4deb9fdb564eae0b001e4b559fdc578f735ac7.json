It won awards from the British Film Institute and the Chicago Film Festival. Pirosmani died of starvation, unable to sell any of his works for sufficient money to support life. Ironically, his primitivist style was later very much in fashion, and huge sums were paid for his surviving paintings. This well-regarded film focuses on Pirosmani's everyday life in the Georgia of his time, and is photographed in a bold style which echoes the artist's vision and causes the viewer to enter into it. This is necessary, because little factual material about the artist was available; most of his biography was composed of legends and recorded gossip. The film's director, Georgi Shengelaya, is the son of Nikolai Shengelaya, one of the founders of Georgia's film industry; his mother was an early Georgian movie star. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Pirosmani.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.05 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 846 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Bit rate : 1 724 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 512 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.196\n      Stream size : 1 001 MiB (93%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 21mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 112 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Channel positions : C\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 65.1 MiB (6%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064815/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064815/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian, Georgian and French audio; English, French and Spanish subtitles\n\nGeorgiy Shengelaya - Pirosmani (1969)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4deb9fdb564eae0b001e4b559fdc578f735ac7","amp;dn":"Georgiy+Shengelaya+-+Pirosmani+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4deb9fdb564eae0b001e4b559fdc578f735ac7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,77,235,159,219,86,78,174,11,0,30,75,85,159,220,87,143,115,90,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
