But for every celebrity psychopath whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gotten ink for spilling blood, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bevy of all-but-forgotten homicidal fiends studding the bloody margins of U.S. history. The law gave them their just desserts, but now the hugely acclaimed author of The Serial Killer Files and The Whole Death Catalog gives them their dark due in this absolutely riveting true-crime treasury. Among AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most cold-blooded youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Robert Irwin, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Mad SculptorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: He longed to use his carving skills on the woman he lovedÃ¢â‚¬â€but had to settle for making short work of her mother and sister instead.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Peter Robinson, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Tell-Tale Heart KillerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: It took two days and four tries for him to finish off his victim, but no time at all for keen-eyed cops to spot the fatal flaw in his floor plan.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Anton Probst, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Monster in the Shape of a ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: The ax-murdering immigrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s systematic slaughter of all eight members of a Pennsylvania farm family matched the savagery of the Manson murders a century later.\n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Edward H. Ruloff, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Man of Two LivesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: A genuine Jekyll and Hyde, his brilliant scholarship disguised his bloodthirsty brutality, and his oversized brain gave new meaning to Ã¢â‚¬Å“mastermind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nSpurred by profit, passion, paranoia, or perverse pleasure, these killersÃ¢â‚¬â€the Witch of Staten Island, the Smutty Nose Butcher, the Bluebeard of Quiet Dell, and many othersÃ¢â‚¬â€span three centuries and a host of harrowing murder methods. Dramatized in the pages of pennysensationalized in tabloid headlines, and immortalized in Ã¢â‚¬Å“murder balladsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and classic fiction by Edgar Allan Poe and Theodore Dreiser, the demonic denizens of Psycho USA may be long gone to the gallowsÃ¢â‚¬â€but this insidiously irresistible slice of gothic Americana will ensure that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll no longer be forgotten.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/7f/ed/87f1c060ada09b9ca8de0210.L._V192629994_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/7f/ed/87f1c060ada09b9ca8de0210.L._V192629994_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nA professor of American literature and culture at Queens College, Harold Schechter is the dean of American true crime.
