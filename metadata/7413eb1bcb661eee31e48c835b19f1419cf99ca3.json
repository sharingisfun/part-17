Whether he is contrasting the elegance of one of the last flights of the supersonic Concorde with the good-times-and-chicken-wings populism of Hooters Air; working as a cabana boy at a South Beach hotel; or traveling to a private island off the coast of Belize to watch a soft-core video shootÃ¢â‚¬â€where he is provided with his very own personal manservantÃ¢â‚¬â€rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly skewered. Somewhere along the line, our healthy self-regard has exploded into obliterating narcissism; our manic getting and spending have now become celebrated as moral virtues. Simultaneously a Wildean satire and a plea for a little human decency, DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get Too Comfortable shows that far from being bobos in paradise, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in a special circle of gilded-age hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7413eb1bcb661eee31e48c835b19f1419cf99ca3","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Get+Too+Comfortable+-+David+Rakoff.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7413eb1bcb661eee31e48c835b19f1419cf99ca3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,19,235,27,203,102,30,238,49,228,140,131,91,25,241,65,156,249,156,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
