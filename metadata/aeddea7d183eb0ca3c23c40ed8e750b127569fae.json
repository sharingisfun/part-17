ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also clearly given her time to forge musical relationships with some of the avant-garde talents drawn to the musical Mecca that is Sao Paulo, and write some great new material. For whilst her debut was thoughtful and quirky with some delightful moments, Vagarosa is altogether more mature in both breadth and mood. The album is a window on modern Sao Paulo. This is a city that consumes the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cultures voraciously ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but without understanding more than a smattering of English, and encountering it third-hand through the internet and a tireless media. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a city that has become the centre of art and culture in Latin America but which (uniquely for that continent) is not ethnically Latin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made up of Japanese, Koreans, Italians, Germans, Portuguese and Arabs who encountered Africa and indigenous nations here in the 20th century to produce a kind of Antipodean New York. CeuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, like the best of her contemporaries, reflects this. Whilst it could only be Brazilian, it blends a world of styles together ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ samba, reggae, soundtracks, trip-hop, MPB and melodic pop ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all played by a diverse coterie of cutting-edge session musicians (including Nacao ZumbiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incomparable rhythm section of Pupillo and Dengue) and filtered through dubby, dreamy production which gives the whole a lush, laid-back groove. CeuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice soothes and floats over all in soporific simple melodies or multi-layered harmonies. From the seductive, lilting and cooing after the opening cotinga calls on 'Espaconave' to the light, 50-second mandolin samba and faux-crackly vinyl fade-out on 'Sobre O Amor E Seu Trabalho Silencioso', this is a wonderful album.\n-- SongLines\n\n&quot;The finest Brazilian album of the year&quot;\n-- The Guardian\n\n&quot;It oozes class and is Brazilian to the core yet, surreptitiously and almost imperceptibly, guides it to a whole new place.&quot;\n-- BBC\n\n&quot;Whatever the motivation, Vagarosa is a peaceful bit of summer that transcends the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œworld musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ label it will inevitably be tagged with.&quot;\n-- PopMatters\n\n&quot;...the album is a great blend of the classic sweet Brasilian vocals and traditional instruments we know and love coupled with some pleasing fusions and experimental touches that give the album extra depth and interest.&quot;\n-- FlyGlobalMusic\n\n&quot;...an extremely impressive, assured album&quot;\n-- AllMusic\n\nTracks\n01- Sobre o Amor e Seu Trabalho Silencioso\n02- Cangote\n03- Comadi\n04- Bubuia\n05- Nascente\n06- Grains de Beaute\n07- Vira Lata\n08- Papa\n09- Ponteiro\n10- Cordao da Insonia\n11- Rosa Menina Rosa\n12- Sonambulo\n13- Espaconave\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeddea7d183eb0ca3c23c40ed8e750b127569fae","amp;dn":"Ceu+-+Vagarosa+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeddea7d183eb0ca3c23c40ed8e750b127569fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,221,234,125,24,62,176,202,60,35,196,14,216,231,80,177,39,86,159,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
