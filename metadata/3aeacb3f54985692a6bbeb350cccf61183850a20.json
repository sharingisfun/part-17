Excellent comprehensive books are being brought out at\nregular intervals, which helps an ophthalmologist to keep abreast with\ntimes. In my 15 years experience as a residency director, I have often\nfound the need for a concise, examination oriented ready-reckoner, which\nwould be of use to the postgraduates to answer specifically to the point.\nThis book aims to fill this gap and serves as a compilation of the frequently\nasked questions (FAQs) and the answers expected in a postgraduate\nclinical ophthalmology examination. This book should not be misconstrued\nas a replacement to the existing standard textbooks. These questions\nhave been painstakingly gathered over a 10-year period from the collective\nexperience of several senior teachers at Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai,\nTamil Nadu, India. Apart from the exam-oriented questions, this book also\ncontains examples of case sheet writing and different management\nscenarios, which will help the students to logically analyze and answer in\na coherent manner. I do sincerely hope that this book helps the postgraduate\nto face his/her examination with confidence.\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c4a9b1aca5a9a9a5a0eab3a5b5a5b6eaa5a6a6a5b784a8adb2a1eaa7aba9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aeacb3f54985692a6bbeb350cccf61183850a20","amp;dn":"Aravind+FAQs+in+Ophthalmology%5Bvickey%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aeacb3f54985692a6bbeb350cccf61183850a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,234,203,63,84,152,86,146,166,187,235,53,12,204,246,17,131,133,10,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
