It is the first of what came to be called his &quot;chamber dramas,&quot; which positioned four characters in one place where they could interact like a string quartet. It has also been referred to as the first of his trilogy of faith, followed by Winter Light and The Silence, dealing with issues of God and love. Shot in black-and-white and running only 90 minutes long, the film opens with a quote from the book of Corinthians. Suffering from severe mental illness, Karin (Harriet Andersson) has just been released from a psychiatric hospital. She vacations for a summer on an island with her family to help speed up her recovery, but they can't offer the support that she needs. Her father, David (Gunnar BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnstrand), is a clinical and detached writer; her husband, Martin (Max Von Sydow), is a doctor unable to assist her illness; and her brother, Minus (Lars PassgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rd), is sexually coming of age and dealing with his own emotional problems. Karin's condition worsens and she thinks a spider is God. It has been argued that the script for Through a Glass Darkly was influenced by Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story, The Yellow Wallpaper. \n\n[ IMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055499 | Rating: 8.0 / 10 (4,366 votes) ]\n                                     \n[General]===================================\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Through.A.Glass.Darkly.1961.DVDRip.x264.AC3 KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.50 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 29mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 389 Kbps\nSource                           : Criterion NTSC DVD9\n\n[Video]=====================================\n\nFormat                           : AVC\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate                         : 1 957 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2 000 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.236\nStream size                      : 1.23 GiB (82%)\nTitle                            : Track 1\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65\n\n[Audio]=====================================                              \n\n[] Track 1\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 123 MiB (8%)\nTitle                            : Track 1\nLanguage                         : Swedish\n\n[] Track 2 - English dub\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 123 MiB (8%)\nTitle                            : Track 2 - (Dub)\nLanguage                         : English\n\n[Subtitles]=================================\n\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID                         : S_TEXT/UTF8\nTitle                            : Track 1\nLanguage                         : English\n\n[Chapters]==================================\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:01:54.383                     : :Chapter 2\n00:06:29.325                     : :Chapter 3\n00:09:51.527                     : :Chapter 4\n00:14:14.790                     : :Chapter 5\n00:21:06.201                     : :Chapter 6\n00:24:38.746                     : :Chapter 7\n00:31:32.660                     : :Chapter 8\n00:37:43.030                     : :Chapter 9\n00:42:47.701                     : :Chapter 10\n00:46:57.083                     : :Chapter 11\n00:53:38.151                     : :Chapter 12\n00:59:54.643                     : :Chapter 13\n01:06:52.444                     : :Chapter 14\n01:13:20.832                     : :Chapter 15\n01:18:42.153                     : :Chapter 16\n01:26:39.797                     : :Chapter 17\n01:29:54.692                     : :Chapter 18\n\n[KARiNA]===================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43fa282e3cdf8951525f8ceec6d3b24aedb85d0e","amp;dn":"Through.A.Glass.Darkly.1961.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43fa282e3cdf8951525f8ceec6d3b24aedb85d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,250,40,46,60,223,137,81,82,95,140,238,198,211,178,74,237,184,93,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
