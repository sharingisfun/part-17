Recorded in 1975 but only released some years ago for the first time, Walked All Night Long captures the raw intensity of guitarist/vocalist Louisiana Red combining forces with the brilliant guitar wizardry of the under-appreciated and greatly overlooked Lefty Dizz. &quot;Lefty Dizz was one of the most formidable guitarists on the Chicago scene. His best recorded work surfaced recently on a remarkable, never released before Louisiana Red session (Red on vocals and acoustic slide, Dizz on phenomenal electric guitar). An informal yet charged set, it perfectly combines the dark lyricism of the enigmatic Louisiana Red and the remarkable deft and unique guitar work of Lefty Dizz.&quot; \n\nTracklist : \n1.
