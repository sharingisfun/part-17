Jesus was the greatest human that ever lived\nB.  Tolstoy was the greatest human alive in Gandhi's day, the most Christlike.\n\n'I like your Christ.  I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike your Christ.'  Gandhi.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/What-I-Believe-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/1402185235&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/What-I-Believe-Leo-Tolstoy/dp/1402185235&lt;/a&gt;\n\n1.

Dont complain.  \nDont get in the way.\n\n-------------------------\n\nRegarding Tolstoy:\n\nThe Kingdom of God is Within You is the reason we know the name Gandhi. Gandhi read this (begin with the last 2 chapters) as a young law student. It entirely changed the direction of his life. Tolstoy's work regarding Jesus became Gandhi's &quot;Bible&quot; in South Africa and India.\n\nThe Gospel in Brief is Tolstoy's translation of the Bible. The greatest story ever told - without all the Voodoo added later on.\n\nThe Law of Love and the Law of Violence, written 2 weeks before his death, was instrumental to Dr. King; a book he read when at Crozier Seminary in his youth.\n\n------------------\n\nNotice:  Tolstoy's books on Jesus' Teachings often are written to be read beginning, end, and only then, middle.  This 'What I Believe' is such a book, and hence the sequencing of this audio rendering.  Should you wish a different sequencing, it will be easy for you to achieve.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31b4e0250c39d02d2c9ad5b360a13d71d02e1cb","amp;dn":"What+I+Believe+-+Tolstoy+-+the+abortion+called+christianity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31b4e0250c39d02d2c9ad5b360a13d71d02e1cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,27,78,2,80,195,157,2,210,201,173,91,54,10,19,215,29,2,225,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
