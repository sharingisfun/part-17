Two SUPER productions from two SUPER artists on one beautiful release on the Kompakt Extra label.\n\nMoving you along swiftly from my previous release of Speicher 40... here is the much more recent and ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL Speicher 55.\n\nIf you are new to both or either of these artists, you are strongly advised to give this a try.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1077580&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1077580&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLabel:\tKompakt Extra\nCatalog#:\tKOMEX55\nFormat:\tVinyl, 12&quot;, 45 RPM\nCountry:\tGermany\nReleased:\tSep 2007\nGenre:\tElectronic\nStyle:\tTech House, Minimal\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01 - Gui Boratto - Matryoshka [8:34]\n02 - SCSI-9 - Another Day Acid [7:58]\n\n37.8MB\n\n320KBps Digital Release.\n\nRe-post.\n\n\n\nIf you missed this the last time round on my release schedule, do not hesitate this time round.  In any case, the previously posted torrent topped the 10,000 marker within a week.\n\n\n&quot; Two of the best Kompakt artists on a back-to-back single is a salivating prospect, and the results more than live up to expectations. This is so good that itÃƒÂ¢??s hard to pick the better of the two sides. Both feature long tracks with complicated arrangements, and a hint of neo-trance just where itÃƒÂ¢??s wanted, bringing a little excess and flamboyance to proceedings.\n\nBrazilian Gui Boratto kicks off where his Chromophobia album finished off with ÃƒÂ¢??MatryoshkaÃƒÂ¢??, a track named after the Russian folk dolls hidden one inside the other. Taking his cue from the dolls perhaps, Boratto carefully decorates each successive passage with new variations of subtle percussion and spacious pulses. Each layer is a new realm of melody and texture to mine, but rather than get smaller like the dolls, these seem to grow bigger and deeper throughout the track. The result is some seriously pulsating pop techno that has you instantly where it wants you to be and then gives you some. Boratto is at his opulent best.\n\nOn the flip, Russian duo SCSI-9 continue to lift their own high bar, offering, like Boratto, a complicated and pulsating number riddled with progressive and disintegrating moments. Opening with an ambient drift, ÃƒÂ¢??Another Day AcidÃƒÂ¢?? suddenly bursts into light, then slowly builds into an unconscious and yet quietly frenetic track. Chiming and reflective, it is tinged with just enough darkness, as is always the case with SCSI-9. \n\nTogether, these two tracks are arguably the perfect Kompakt sound of now. &quot;\n\n\nYou can find out more information about the extremely talented and tasteful producers, Gui Boratto and SCSI-9 at the following locations:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.guiboratto.com.br/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.guiboratto.com.br/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/guiboratto&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/guiboratto&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.scsi-9.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.scsi-9.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kompakt-net.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kompakt-net.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16e39a8e98c4ffaeaa7670cdc9fdcfa71ebca33","amp;dn":"Gui+Boratto+%2F+SCSI-9+-+Matryoshka+%2F+Another+Acid+Day+2007+%5BKompa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a16e39a8e98c4ffaeaa7670cdc9fdcfa71ebca33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,110,57,168,233,140,79,250,234,167,103,12,220,159,220,250,113,235,202,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
