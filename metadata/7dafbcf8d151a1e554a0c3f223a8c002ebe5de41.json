There has never been a lovelier &quot;Tis Autumn&quot; or &quot;Stars Fell On Alabama&quot; or &quot;You Turned The Tables On Me&quot; - not by an instrumentalist, at any rate. \nThis set is rounded out by four bonus tracks that Getz cut with a quartet in 1954 that co-starred pianist Jimmy Rowles, featuring drummer Max Roach.\n\n\n\nSTAN GETZ\n\nStan Getz Plays 1954\n\nCD / Verve / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
