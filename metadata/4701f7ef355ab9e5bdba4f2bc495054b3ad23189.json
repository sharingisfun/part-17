He had already performed &quot;Bluebird Revisited&quot; on tour with Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young in 1969.\n\nThe album was not as well received as its predecessor peaking at #8 on the Billboard album chart and with most reviews labeling it as indulgent, or as Rolling Stone put it, &quot;fifth-rate self-indulgence&quot;. About the only thing the reviewers complimented were the songs &quot;Change Partners&quot; and &quot;Marianne&quot;, which were the album's singles but only hit #43 and #42, respectively, on the Billboard singles chart.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Change Partners&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n    &quot;Nothin' To Do But Today&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:40\n    &quot;Fishes and Scorpions&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n    &quot;Sugar Babe&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n    &quot;Know You Got to Run&quot; (Stills, John Hopkins) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:50\n    &quot;Open Secret&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:00\n    &quot;Relaxing Town&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:20\n    &quot;Singin' Call&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;Ecology Song&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:22\n    &quot;Word Game&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:13\n    &quot;Marianne&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\n    &quot;Bluebird Revisited&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:23\n\n\n    Bass - Calvin &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Samuels, Stephen Stills\n    Congas - Gaspar Lawrawal, Rocky Dijon\n    Drums - Conrad Isidore, Dallas Taylor, &quot;English Richie&quot; (Ringo Starr)\n    Engineer - Bill Halverson\n    Guitar - Eric Clapton (on &quot;Fishes And Scorpions&quot;),Stephen Stills\n    Keyboards - Preston, Rebennack, Lofgren, Harris, Stephen Stills\n    Producer - Bill Halverson, Stephen Stills\n    Saxophone [Baritone] - Floyd Newman, James Mitchell\n    Saxophone [Tenor] - Andrew Love, Ed Logan, Sidney George\n    Trombone - Jack Helm\n    Trumpet - Roger Hopps, Wayne Jackson\n    Vocals - Crosby, Henry Diltz, Nils Lofgren, Stephen Stills\n    Pedal steel guitar (on &quot;Change Partners&quot;) - Jerry Garcia,\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4701f7ef355ab9e5bdba4f2bc495054b3ad23189","amp;dn":"Stephen+Stills+-+Stephen+Stills+2+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4701f7ef355ab9e5bdba4f2bc495054b3ad23189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,1,247,239,53,90,185,229,189,186,79,43,196,149,5,75,58,210,49,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
