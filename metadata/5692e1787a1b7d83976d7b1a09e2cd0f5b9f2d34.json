For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nWell.. I've got this CD from 2002, by a Norwegian guy, Ole Borud, and since I first heard it, I haven't been quite able to forget it.. So I bought it a while ago, and I've decided to upload it in superb quality for all of you Sub-Church, Jesus-people out there..\n\nIt's a record that deals with many subjects, and from quite unusual points of view, and you should be able to find a favorite in here at the first listening.. And then probably another one.. He is a great musician with a great voice, and a true heart.\n\nYou can look him up at MySpace, just search for: oleborud\nBut, if you do, be aware that this record, Chi-Rho, is much rougher and less polished than his current release. It doesn't even remotely sound like it.\nNot anywhere.\n\nThis is a record I really feel is for the young'uns, but it's not that easy to get by, and so I thought it to be a good idea, and that Ole wouldn't mind, if I uploaded it, but I haven't asked him..\n\nIf you read this, Ole, please let me know what you think of me doing this. My guess and my hope is you'll say it's OK..\n\nI'll take my chances, since it's my own property, and therefore Jesus' property, since all of mine is His, and I do with mine what I want, and he used to say about His: &quot;..now freely give..&quot;, and freely I will give too..\n\nWith lots of good wishes and in Christ's Love,\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a6d0c3d4cfc0cfd4c3cbc7cfcae6c1cbc7cfca88c5c9cb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5692e1787a1b7d83976d7b1a09e2cd0f5b9f2d34","amp;dn":"Ole+Borud+-+Chi-Rho+%5B2002%5D%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5692e1787a1b7d83976d7b1a09e2cd0f5b9f2d34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,146,225,120,122,27,125,131,151,109,123,26,9,226,205,15,91,159,45,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
