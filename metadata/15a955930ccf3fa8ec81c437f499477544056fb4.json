It peaked at No. 5 in the UK. It was his first ever studio double album.\n\nThe album of songs was recorded during sessions at Wool Hall Studios, Beckington, Townhouse, London and Westside Studios, London with MIck Glossop as engineer except for the song, &quot;Take Me Back&quot;. It was recorded in 1990 at Pavilion Studios in London with Martin Hayles and Mick Glossop as engineers.\n\nThe songs on the album were primarily concerning two themes, the singer's uneasy relationship with the music business and a nostalgic yearning for his youth in Belfast. &quot;Why Must I Always Explain?&quot; was set to the same melody as 1970s &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;. There were two hymns. &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; and &quot;Just a Closer Walk With Thee&quot;. &quot;Take Me Back&quot;, &quot;On Hyndford Street&quot; and &quot;See Me Through Part II&quot; were remembrances of his seemingly carefree childhood but &quot;Hyndford Street&quot; also referred more specifically to spiritual feelings in the words, &quot;Feeling wondrous and lit up inside/With a sense of everlasting life&quot;. The song, &quot;Carrying a Torch&quot; was also included on Tom Jones's album by the same name, along with three other Morrison compositions from &quot;Hymns to the Silence&quot;.\n\n\nIn a review for Time, Jay Cocks says that: &quot;Hymns focuses and redefines Morrison's themes over his long career, rather like a museum retrospective already in progress. It dips deep into autobiography, spiritual speculation and blues mythology for its themes.&quot;\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nVan Morrison - vocal, guitar, harmonica, alto saxophone\nHaji Ahkba - flugelhorn\nDerek Bell - synthesizer\nThe Chieftains\nTerry Disley - piano\nNeil Drinkwater - accordion, piano, synthesizer\nCandy Dulfer - alto saxophone\nDave Early- drums, percussion\nGeorgie Fame - piano, Hammond organ, backing vocals\nEddie Friel - piano, Hammond organ, synthesizer\nSteve Gregory - flute, baritone saxophone\nCarol Kenyon - backing vocals\nKatie Kissoon - backing vocals\nSteve Pearce - bass\nPaul Robinson - drums\nNicky Scott - bass\nKate St John - cor anglais\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nDisc One\n\n1.&quot;Professional Jealousy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n2.&quot;I'm Not Feeling It Anymore&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:34\n3.&quot;Ordinary Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n4.&quot;Some Peace of Mind&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:24\n5.&quot;So Complicated&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n6.&quot;I Can't Stop Loving You&quot; - (Gibson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 (With The Chieftains)\n7.&quot;Why Must I Always Explain?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n8.&quot;Village Idiot&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n9.&quot;See Me Through, Pt. 2 (Just a Closer Walk with Thee)&quot; - (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n10.&quot;Take Me Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:11\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n1.&quot;By His Grace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n2.&quot;All Saints Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n3.&quot;Hymns to the Silence&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:42\n4.&quot;On Hyndford Street&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n5.&quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; - (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49 (With The Chieftains)\n6.&quot;Carrying a Torch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n7.&quot;Green Mansions&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n8.&quot;Pagan Streams&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38\n9.&quot;Quality Street&quot; - (Morrison, Rebennack) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n10.&quot;It Must Be You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n11.&quot;I Need Your Kind of Loving&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15a955930ccf3fa8ec81c437f499477544056fb4","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Hymns+To+The+Silence++%5B1991%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15a955930ccf3fa8ec81c437f499477544056fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,169,85,147,12,207,63,168,236,129,196,55,244,153,71,117,68,5,111,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
