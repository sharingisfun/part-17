Specifically, the following topics are covered: implementing JavaScript unit tests; explaining the intent of Dynamic Languages, Web Services and SOA; defining and implementing contracts using REST; understanding why JavaScript Functions have state; implementing JavaScript &quot;Generics&quot;, which are a mixture between real Generics and a replacement algorithm; using code blocks; using functions to make decisions; understanding the difference of JavaScript code that behaves like a value type or a reference type; implementing proxies, delegates, mixins, and overloaded functions; implementing a complete Ajax and Web Service architecture; defining a Web Service using REST; handling large or slow or real-time data sets; implementing shopping cart type architectures; and solving the back button problem using Ajax.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca22f6a3802e6c833b4ec0fb4dd963903c7481f7","amp;dn":"Ajax+and+REST+Recipes%3A+A+Problem-Solution+Approach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca22f6a3802e6c833b4ec0fb4dd963903c7481f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,34,246,163,128,46,108,131,59,78,192,251,77,217,99,144,60,116,129,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
