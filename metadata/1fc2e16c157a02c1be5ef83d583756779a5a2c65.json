The inspiration for SimCity came from a feature of the game Raid on Bungeling Bay that allowed players to create their own maps. Wright soon found he enjoyed creating maps more than playing the actual game, and so began creating SimCity.\nSimCity is predominantly a single-player game \nThe objective of SimCity, as the name of the game suggests, is to build and design a city, without specific goals to achieve (except in the scenarios, which typically require the player to achieve a certain population or bank balance in a given period of time).\n\nFeatures:\nThe player can mark land as being zoned as commercial, industrial, or residential, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and many other actions, in order to enhance the city. Also, the player can face disasters: flooding, tornadoes, fires, riots, earthquakes, etc.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPosted by............: mschol\nPosted on............: 01-7-2005 @ PiSexy.org\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.Unrar\n2.Install\n3.Play!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fc2e16c157a02c1be5ef83d583756779a5a2c65","amp;dn":"Simcity+Classic+for+windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fc2e16c157a02c1be5ef83d583756779a5a2c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,194,225,108,21,122,2,193,190,94,248,61,88,55,86,119,154,90,44,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
