In his new series about the Galapagos Islands, the veteran broadcaster was thrilled to come face to face with a creature missed by Charles Darwin. Now he will give viewers their first glimpse of the rare, pink iguana - which lives on top of a volcano &quot;It's a remarkable thing in this day and age when you think about the number of scientists per square metre in the Galapagos, and yet suddenly we have discovered a new species,&quot; Sir David said. &quot;A little periwinkle or something which nobody has identified before is one thing, but this is more than that. &quot;You would have thought because these islands have been pretty well raked over by scientists for 150 years that the basics would be pretty well established, but that they should discover a new species of iguana is quite extraordinary. The new iguana will feature in the third episode of Galapagos\n\n\n\n\n3)  Evolution \nNo two islands in the Galapagos are the same. The imperceptible drift of a continental plate keeps each island biologically isolated. David Attenborough explores this evolutionary crucible, encountering tortoises that weigh up to half a tonne, finches that use tools and lizards that communicate using press-ups; for Darwin, this was all evidence for his theory of evolution. We see the final footage of the world famous tortoise fondly known as Lonesome George, the last survivor of his species. David Attenborough was the last person to have ever filmed with him. Darwin's famous visit had a downside - the arrival of man. David investigates the impact we've had in these islands, as our influence is a double-edged sword. We've disrupted the natural balance but he also believes Darwin would be thrilled with the advances we have made in science. We're also now uncovering evidence that evolution is more rapid than Darwin could ever have imagined. Whatever wonders the Galapagos Islands hold today, they are only a hint of what awaits them in the future.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/7554/galapagosscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img51.imageshack.us/img51/7554/galapagosscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4044/galapagosscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4044/galapagosscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/1824/galapagosscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/1824/galapagosscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/7400/galapagosscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img9.imageshack.us/img9/7400/galapagosscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/5281/galapagosscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img62.imageshack.us/img62/5281/galapagosscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5849/galapagosscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/5849/galapagosscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/5827/galapagosscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/5827/galapagosscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9158/galapagosscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9158/galapagosscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2209/galapagosscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/2209/galapagosscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6921000e0129255a4758&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16.9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps AVC 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 1.27 GB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: HDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/galapagos-sir-david-attenborough-captures-1512840&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/galapagos-sir-david-attenborough-captures-1512840&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17532b5fd5877db18b4621353def029f501ecb06","amp;dn":"BSkyB+Galapagos+with+David+Attenborough+3of4+Evolution+PDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17532b5fd5877db18b4621353def029f501ecb06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,83,43,95,213,135,125,177,139,70,33,53,61,239,2,159,80,30,203,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
