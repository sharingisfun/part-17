One of the best loved and most successful Australian films ever made based on the epic poem by A.B. (Banjo) Paterson and its hit sequel featuring Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton.  Both films have been painstakingly digitally restored by producer Geoff Burrowes for their DVD release in the original widescreen theatrical presentation and with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.\nEXPERIENCE AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN...AND RIDE WITH THE LEGEND TWICE!\n\nSee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Snowy_River_%28poem%29\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084296/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084296/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Man from Snowy River (1982)\n\nThe story of a boy suddenly alone in the world. The men who challenge him. And the girl who helps him become a man. \nJim Craig has lived his first 18 years in the mountains of Australia on his father&amp;#039;s farm. The death of his father forces him to go to the low lands to earn enough money to get the farm back on its feet. Kirk Douglas plays two roles as twin brothers who haven&amp;#039;t spoken for years, one of whom was Jim&amp;#039;s father&amp;#039;s best friend and the other of whom is the father of the girl he wants to marry. A 20 year old feud re-erupts, catching Jim and Jessica in the middle of it as Jim is accused of letting a prize stallion loose. He rides off with the crack riders to bring it back, back into the mountains where he was raised. Jim goes out with them because of the regard in which his father was held, and comes back having earned his own respect.\nWritten by John Vogel\n\n\nC O M M E N T S\n\nA Favorite, 4 September 2004\nAuthor: from Lanham, Maryland \n\nThe Man from Snowy River is a family favorite. The cinematography of this film was breath-taking. The love story was convincing and the acting was superb. Kirk Douglas plays both the father and the brother and although the plot is somewhat contrived, it is set up extremely well. All of the elements work to make a good movie and one that I watch over and over. The scenes of the Australian mountains and the horses along with the musical score make this a very picturesque, romantic, and warm film. A romance and an action-adventure movie rolled into one which can charm a woman and still be a manly film. The 2nd movie Return to Snowy River was a worthy sequel and Tom Burlinson as Jim Craig does an excellent job in both films...I would definitely recommend this film. \n\n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea8b60552a81ca221b1d96a367a955f46f738de3","amp;dn":"Man+From+Snowy+River+1%5B1982%5DDvDrip%5B720x436%5DAC3%5B6ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea8b60552a81ca221b1d96a367a955f46f738de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,139,96,85,42,129,202,34,27,29,150,163,103,169,85,244,111,115,141,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
