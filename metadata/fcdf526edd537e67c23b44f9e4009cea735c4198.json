Every human possesses a trait of supernatural that lays dormant within their genetic make-up. Centuries of diluting and breeding have allowed humans to think they are alone and untouched by magic. But what happens when something changes?\n\nAs one of the seven lightning struck women, Nadie Morgan has known for a while now that her fate would be forever changedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and revolve around a certain dragon. From the first time Dante Bell saw Nadie, he knew she was the one for him. There's just one problem--there's another in his life he's waiting on as well.\n\nWhen Jace Goodwin, a bear shifter and Mediator, finally comes back to the human realm after years away under circumstances out of his control, his first stop is to Dante's Circle where he not only finds his dragon, but the woman they both have been waiting for. \n\nOnce secrets are told and the sparks fly, Nadie's new life becomes something she never thought possible. However there's another realm at play and Jace and Nadie's dragon will have to fight harder than he's ever fought before to keep the life he's waited eons for.\n\nWarning: Contains one not-so-innocent human, a bear known for his bear-hugs, a tattooed and pierced dragon with a fiery temper, and a connection so explosive, you'll be fanning yourself from page one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdf526edd537e67c23b44f9e4009cea735c4198","amp;dn":"Tangled+Innocence+Dante%27s+Circle+%234+%28Carrie+Ann+Ryan%29+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdf526edd537e67c23b44f9e4009cea735c4198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,223,82,110,221,83,126,103,194,59,68,249,228,0,156,234,115,92,65,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
