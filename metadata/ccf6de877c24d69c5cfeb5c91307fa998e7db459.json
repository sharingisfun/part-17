Their hit songs have included &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;, &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot;, &quot;Blue Collar Man&quot; and &quot;The Best of Times&quot;. They have four consecutive albums certified multi-platinum by the RIAA.\n\n\nTwin brothers Chuck and John Panozzo first got together with their neighbour Dennis DeYoung in 1961 in the Roseland section of the south side of Chicago, eventually taking the band name &quot;The Tradewinds&quot;. Chuck Panozzo left to attend seminary school for a year but returned to the group by 1964. By this time, the others had brought in guitarist Tom Nardini to teach Chuck the guitar. Chuck decided to rejoin the others as bassist. Brother John was the drummer, while Dennis had switched from accordion to organ and piano. In 1965, the name &quot;Tradewinds&quot; was changed to TW4 after another band called The Trade Winds broke through nationally. By 1966, the Panozzo brothers had joined DeYoung at Chicago State University and kept the group together doing gigs at high schools and frat parties while studying to be teachers. In 1969, they added a college buddy, John Curulewski, on guitar after Nardini departed. Guitarist James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young came aboard in 1970 making TW4 a quintet.\n\nIn 1972, the band members decided to choose a new name when they signed to Wooden Nickel Records; several suggestions were made and, says DeYoung, Styx was chosen because it was &quot;the only one that none of us hated&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1995\n\n\n\nStyx - Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the American rock band Styx. It was released by A&amp;M Records on August 22, 1995.\n\nThis album essentially replaced Styx's previous greatest hits album, Styx - Classics, Volume 15, which was released by A&amp;M in 1987. That previous album had excluded the hit song &quot;Lady&quot; because the song was originally recorded for and released through Wooden Nickel Records (which also had a distribution arrangement with RCA Records). Because A&amp;M/Polygram had been unable to secure distribution rights to the song, most of the classic lineup of Styx (Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw, Chuck Panozzo, and James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young) reunited to re-record the track at Dennis' home studio, The White Room. They were joined by uncredited session drummer Todd Suchermann, who filled in for John Panozzo due to Panozzo's failing health. The track, which is very similar to the original, was titled &quot;Lady '95&quot;.\n\nWith the exception of &quot;Lady '95&quot;, Styx - Greatest Hits features the original album versions of all the other songs included in the compilation. &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; is presented here in its full 6:05 version and &quot;Miss America&quot; is here in its original studio version (despite the CD's packaging showing incorrect time listings for both tracks).\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Lady '95&quot; (D.
