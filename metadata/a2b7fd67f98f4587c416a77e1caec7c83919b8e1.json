The film was also the last to be produced by the main creators of the Godzilla character, with IshirÃ…ï¿½ Honda directing, Eiji Tsuburaya supervising the special effects (with Sadamasa Arikawa actually directing), Tomoyuki Tanaka producing, and Akira Ifukube handling the film's score.\n\n The film was released theatrically in the United States in the Spring of 1969 by American International Pictures.\n\nLanguage : English\n Format : AVI\n File size : 700 MiB\n Duration : 1h 29mn\n Overall bit rate : 1 097 Kbps\n Width : 608 pixels\n Height : 288 pixels\n Display aspect ratio : 2.111\n Frame rate : 23.976 fps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b7fd67f98f4587c416a77e1caec7c83919b8e1","amp;dn":"Destroy+All+Monsters+%281968%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b7fd67f98f4587c416a77e1caec7c83919b8e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,183,253,103,249,143,69,135,196,22,167,126,28,174,199,200,57,25,184,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
