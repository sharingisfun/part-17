No one's sure what the Queen of Sorrow wants to do next, and what her plans with Sorrow are.\nIn a new Dreamory, Snow White learns who the real Cinderella really is, where she came from, her relationship with Sorrow, and what historical period she'd affected with what she calls the Forbidden Art. Also, Axel and Fable learn Loki's true identity, Charmwill's true name, and a little bit about themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa7f3fc744d2bf7bf95a2abdc3e1d1cdd51e3a5","amp;dn":"Cameron+Jace+-+Cinderella+Dressed+in+Ashes+%28Grimm+Diaries+%232%29+Pr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa7f3fc744d2bf7bf95a2abdc3e1d1cdd51e3a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,167,243,252,116,77,43,247,191,149,162,171,220,62,29,28,221,81,227,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
