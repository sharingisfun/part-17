Critics routinely rank him as one of the best poets of his generation. Hughes was British Poet Laureate from 1984 until his death.\n\nHughes was married to American poet Sylvia Plath, from 1956 until her suicide in 1963 at the age of 30. His part in the relationship became controversial to some feminists and (particularly) American admirers of Plath. His last poetic work, Birthday Letters (1998), explored their complex relationship. These poems make reference to Plath's suicide, but none of them addresses directly the circumstances of her death. A poem discovered in October 2010, Last letter, describes what happened during the three days leading up to Plath's suicide.\n\nIn 2008 The Times ranked Hughes fourth on their list of &quot;The 50 greatest British writers since 1945&quot;.\n\nHughes's earlier poetic work is rooted in nature and, in particular, the innocent savagery of animals, an interest from an early age. He wrote frequently of the mixture of beauty and violence in the natural world. Animals serve as a metaphor for his view on life: animals live out a struggle for the survival of the fittest in the same way that humans strive for ascendancy and success. Examples can be seen in the poems &quot;Hawk Roosting&quot; and &quot;Jaguar&quot;.\n\nHughes's later work is deeply reliant upon myth and the British bardic tradition, heavily inflected with a modernist, Jungian and ecological viewpoint. He re-worked classical and archetypal myth working with a conception of the dark sub-conscious.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Gaudete\n\n* New and Selected Poems\n\n* The Iron Man\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Hughes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Hughes&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1669/the-art-of-poetry-no-71-ted-hughes&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c39596f7566f4176de7c0c4404ed722dd125227","amp;dn":"Ted+Hughes+-+Poetry+and+Prose+%283+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c39596f7566f4176de7c0c4404ed722dd125227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,57,89,111,117,102,244,23,109,231,192,196,64,78,215,34,221,18,82,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
