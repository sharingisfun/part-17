Although accepting of his status as a great innovator in the struggle against racism, violence, and colonialism, Gandhi feared that enthusiasm for his ideas tended to exceed a deeper understanding. He says that he was after truth rooted in devotion to God and attributed the turning points, successes, and challenges in his life to the will of God. His attempts to get closer to this divine power led him to seek purity through simple living, dietary practices (he called himself a fruitarian), celibacy, and ahimsa, a life without violence. It is in this sense that he calls his book The Story of My Experiments with Truth, offering it also as a reference for those who would follow in his footsteps. A reader expecting a complete accounting of his actions, however, will be sorely disappointed.\nAlthough Gandhi presents his episodes chronologically, he leaves wide gaps, such as the entire satyagraha struggle in South Africa, for which he refers the reader to another of his books. And writing for his contemporaries, he takes it for granted that the reader is familiar with the major events of his life and of the political milieu of early 20th-century India.\nBeneath it all lies his inner spiritual revelations and endless search for truth. From the book:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Identification with everything that lives is impossible without self- purification; without self-purification the observance of the law of Ahimsa must remain an empty dream; God can never be realized by one who is not pure of heart. Self-purification therefore must mean purification in all the walks of life. And purification being highly infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to the purification of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surroundings.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b3a5046f6ee0dcd20632016c8878ebdde99da8","amp;dn":"The+Story+of+My+Experiments+with+Truth+by+Mohandas+Karamchand+Ga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b3a5046f6ee0dcd20632016c8878ebdde99da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,179,165,4,111,110,224,220,210,6,50,1,108,136,120,235,221,233,157,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
