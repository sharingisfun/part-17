In just four years they released three critically-acclaimed albums, toured with Joan Baez and earned a solid following with their indelible live performances at festivals and venues all across North America. Despite Carter's sudden death in July 2002, Grammer's career as an interpreter and instrumentalist continues. &quot;With the release of Flower Of Avalon, Tracy Grammer begins a new story while continuing to champion the songs of her former partner. While the album features 9 brilliant previously unheard Dave Carter songs, the spotlight is clearly on the gorgeous vocals and instrumental prowess of Tracy Grammer.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/12/15/tracy-grammer/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/12/15/tracy-grammer/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3822817dca3f3627c832b08fcecbfebd7aa570","amp;dn":"Tracy+Grammer...Flower+of+Avalon%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3822817dca3f3627c832b08fcecbfebd7aa570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,56,34,129,125,202,63,54,39,200,50,176,143,206,203,254,189,122,165,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
