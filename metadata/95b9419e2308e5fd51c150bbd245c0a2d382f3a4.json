Ook zien we de interviews met vrienden en creatieve partners van Michael. De film bevat onder meer videomateriaal van de laatste repetities van Jackson voor zijn nieuwe reeks concerten, kort voor de dood van de popster op 25 juni.\n\nEnglish\n\nThe film opens with a short text introduction stating the purpose of the footage and its intent &quot;For the fans...&quot;. After short dialogues from various dancers, Kenny Ortega is heard talking through the original concert opening sequence involving a body suit made from screens which display fast clips and images with bright intensity from which Jackson emerges on stage. Immediately after this, Jackson begins &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; first solo, which pauses half-way through and a small snippet of Jackson singing his song &quot;Speechless&quot; acapella is shown. Jackson is then joined by dancers and completes the first number. A short clip showing rehearsals of the &quot;toaster&quot; mechanism is shown before rehearsal footage of &quot;Jam&quot; is played. This plays directly into the green screen adaption of soldiers dancers for &quot;Bad&quot; which are also used for &quot;They Don't Really Care About Us&quot; which is shown next. From here, the film shows Michael directing Ortega and his band for his solo rehearsal performance of &quot;Human Nature&quot; which he performs acapella, then acoustic and finally with full band. Green screen rehearsals for the video vignette for &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; come next, with dress rehearsals of the song following, including parts of the vignette intertwined with the dancing. Jackson is seen next directing his musical team for the cues in his song &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel.&quot; Jackson then performs a rehearsal with dancers which he alters and changes as he goes. A small animatic introducing the Jackson 5 is shown afterwards, and Michael then rehearses &quot;I Want You Back&quot;, &quot;The Love You Save&quot;, &quot;I'll Be There&quot; and &quot;Shake Your Body.&quot; Jackson stops only to report problems with his earpiece. After this, Jackson sings with one of his back up singers on his duet song &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot; in which he sings at full strength, directing his partner as he goes. The filming for the &quot;Thriller&quot; vignette is then shown with Jackson and Ortega watching with 3D glasses. Jackson is then seen rehearsing &quot;Thriller&quot; with the vignette intertwined like that in &quot;Smooth Criminal.&quot; During the dance sequence, puppets are suspended in the audience aisles while Jackson emerges from a robotic spider originally seen in the vignette. Jackson and Ortega rehearsing the cherry-picker is seen next, along with Jackson rehearsing &quot;Beat It.&quot; Jackson creates the ending he wants for the song, a long drum build up in which he tears off his jacket and burns it. Footage of the show's aerialists rehearsing to the instrumental of &quot;Who Is It&quot; is shown next, followed by the Jackson and his band rehearsing &quot;Black or White,&quot; in which he allows guitarist Orianthi Panagaris to take center stage to finish with a high guitar rift. The video-sequence for &quot;Earth Song&quot; is shown next, featuring a small girl who wanders through an abundant forest, falls asleep, and wakes up to find the forest destroyed by man. Jackson then performs the song both onstage and using the cherry-picker, with his voice being heard at the end telling of the dangers of Global Warming and the lack of reversible time left. Afterwards, Michael is seen conversing with Ortega, his dancers and band about the shows, trivial dance moves and his hopes for the concert series. He then performs a quick version of his song &quot;Billie Jean&quot; featuring an extra dance sequence. Michael is then seen talking to all crew members and wishing everyone the best for the London performances. At a sound check, Jackson performs &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot; with strong backing vocals. The film ends with Jackson with his arms extended on stage with the message: &quot;Michael Jackson King of Pop Love Lives Forever \n\n\n- Geluid sporen aanwezig: Dolby Digital 5.1 - Engels\n- Geluid sporen verwijderd: Geen\n- Ondertiteling: Nederlands / Engels / Deens / Duits / Fins / Frans / Hindi / Italiaans / Noors / Portugees / Spaans / Zweeds\n- Video: Untouched\n- Menu: Ja, en aangepast waar nodig\n- Extra's: Deels aanwezig\n\nWeblink : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/60077&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.moviemeter.nl/film/60077&lt;/a&gt;\nWeblink : &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477715&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1477715&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*****************************************\n\nBrought to you by \n2Lions Team\n\nmeer zien??\nKom dan eens kijken op ons forum \n\n                          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.2lions.ons-forum.nl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2Lions the site to be for all your Dutch MOVIES and more\n\n******************************************\n\n\nDON T HIT AND RUN Niet gelijk afhaken als de FILM binnen is blijf seeden. \n\nDon`t quit after you finished the download, but keep seeding\n\n\nThere are fake torrents from uploaders who use our team name.\nThose are not ours, or members from our team.\nWe 2Lions-Team are not responsible for the fake posts on our name\n\nWij 2Lions-Team zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor die zieke FAKE posten die op onze naam worden gedaan\n\nPlease check our site !!!\n\nto the fakers , get a life !!!\n\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95b9419e2308e5fd51c150bbd245c0a2d382f3a4","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+-+This+Is+It+%282010+Release%29%28MULTI+SUBS+12%29+2Lion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95b9419e2308e5fd51c150bbd245c0a2d382f3a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,185,65,158,35,8,229,253,81,193,80,187,210,69,192,162,211,130,243,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
