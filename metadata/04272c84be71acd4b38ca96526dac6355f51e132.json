Covering such entertainment catastrophes as an evil one-eyed midget, George Ringo the Wrestling Beatle, and Goobledy Gooker, the wrestler who emerged in the arena from an egg, this merciless evaluation of such organizations as World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation will leave wrestling fans and critics alike in stitches. The choices of promoters and producers are reviewed in an effort to understand the motivations and imaginations behind the often incomprehensible and laughable stunts that have baffled even die-hard fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04272c84be71acd4b38ca96526dac6355f51e132","amp;dn":"WrestleCrap%3A+The+Very+Worst+of+Pro+Wrestling.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04272c84be71acd4b38ca96526dac6355f51e132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,39,44,132,190,113,172,212,179,140,169,101,38,218,198,53,95,81,225,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
