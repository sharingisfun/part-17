Demonstrating that there should be no relationship between personal style and basic design rules, the programme explored the living spaces that we have inherited - real homes with all their character and shortcomings.\n\n\n\n1. Space and Planning\n\nAs a nation we tend to dwell in small, poorly lit homes - the average lounge is about 15ft square. Llewelyn-Bowen explores how to make tiny rooms seem larger.\n\n\n2. Colour\n\nLlewelyn-Bowen scoffs at the varieties of cream used in decorating, and uses a mix of bold colours to bring a Victorian house to life. Meanwhile, colour consultant Annabel Alton proposes that when choosing the shades to paint their houses, the nation's DIYers are reflecting collective moods of hope, sorrow or optimism.\n\n\n3. Light\n\nWith humans spending more time indoors than ever before, use of light has become a series issue. Laurence shows how to transform a room by maximising its natural light, and what effects can be achieved by atmospheric and moody lighting.\n\n\n4. Textures and Pattern\n\nLaurence Llewelyn-Bowen explains how bold motifs and textural interplay are important factors to consider for successful interior design.\n\n\n5. Balance and Order\n\nWhat are the principal focal points within a room and how can they be used to best effect? In episode 5, Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen applies ancient rules of design that use focal points as energy lines.\n\n\n6. Personality\n\nIn the final programme of the series Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen demonstrates how the design rules can be applied to make a room that's completely individual.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10a7c87fc1b42240f0786df1e70b393949a2f17","amp;dn":"Design+Rules","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10a7c87fc1b42240f0786df1e70b393949a2f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,10,124,135,252,27,66,36,15,7,134,223,30,112,179,147,148,154,47,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
