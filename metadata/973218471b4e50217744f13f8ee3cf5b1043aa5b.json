The techniques applied and the economic and social problems involved are covered. Fishing methods have not changed much since the Stone Age, but continuous technical improvements like the construction of sea-worthy ships, more efficient gear, and finally mechanization of fishing have led to enormous development and a high fish production, of now 100 million tons per year. Extensive utilization has caused heavy overexploitation of the resources and consequently growing concern. The book concludes with an evaluation of perspectives for the future utilization of living resources.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:973218471b4e50217744f13f8ee3cf5b1043aa5b","amp;dn":"A+History+of+Fishing+-Sahrage-+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+PDF_%28K-Slender%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"973218471b4e50217744f13f8ee3cf5b1043aa5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,50,24,71,27,78,80,33,119,68,241,63,142,227,207,91,16,67,170,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
