She released her first single &quot;There You Go&quot;, on her first album, the R&amp;B-oriented Can't Take Me Home, in 2000 via LaFace Records, which garnered commercial success. Her more pop rock-oriented second studio album, Missundaztood, which began a marked shift in the sound of her music, was released in 2001 and was a huge success worldwide. Pink released her third album, Try This, in November 2003, which although less successful commercially than her previous release, still managed to sell around 3 million copies and earned her a Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single Trouble. Her fourth album, called I'm Not Dead, was released in April 2006. The album generated several hit singles, including &quot;Stupid Girls&quot;, &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; and &quot;Who Knew&quot;. Both &quot;U + Ur Hand&quot; and &quot;Who Knew&quot; went to #1 on the pop chart. Her fifth album, Funhouse, was released in late October 2008 and was preceded by her first solo number one on the Hot 100, &quot;So What&quot;. The album notched three other Top 20 hits; &quot;Sober&quot;, &quot;Please Don't Leave Me&quot; and &quot;Glitter in the Air&quot;.\n\n.: Alecia Beth Moore aka Pink :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img399.imageshack.us/img399/1224/pink3ck.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img399.imageshack.us/img399/1224/pink3ck.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Album :.\n\nCan't take me home - 2000\n\n1.
