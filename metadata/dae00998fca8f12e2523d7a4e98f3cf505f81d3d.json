Witness infinity in first-person, and master its rules to solve physics-defying puzzles. Cultivate a garden to open new paths forward, where an eternal expanse awaits.\r\nIn November 2012, William Chyr began working on Manifold Garden. Initially the project was called Relativity, and it drew inspiration from various physics thought experiments. In early 2015, Manifold Garden was backed by Indie Fund. Over the course of its development, the game has been shown in over 20 game conventions and festivals, including E3, Tokyo Game Show, Gamercamp, and Indiecade East","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae00998fca8f12e2523d7a4e98f3cf505f81d3d","amp;dn":"Manifold+Garden+v0.1.1395","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae00998fca8f12e2523d7a4e98f3cf505f81d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,224,9,152,252,168,241,46,37,35,215,164,233,143,60,245,5,248,29,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
