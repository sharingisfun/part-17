When Marva, a struggling Method actress, wakes up in a hologram pool in an exclusive priv club with fancy new clothes, plenty of money, and the memory of a murder, she knows she had better find out whose life she is living, and fast. Pursued by assassins from a mysterious Escort Service as well as by renegade mind-pirates of every description, including her own, Marva must venture into the seamy Downs to learn who has written the script of the most difficult role of her career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:489665294506fd796b95bb2c12b64420f6327ce5","amp;dn":"Fools+-+Pat+Cadigan.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"489665294506fd796b95bb2c12b64420f6327ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,150,101,41,69,6,253,121,107,149,187,44,18,182,68,32,246,50,124,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
