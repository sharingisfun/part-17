He lives by the mantra that he's retired until he needs money to get by, which he spends on lavishly indulgent boy's toys. His only real goal in life is adding a curved TV to his enormous gadget collection.\n\nBut when someone starts brutally murdering people, Blake is forced to catch the killer by the inept and under-funded local police. Lured by the promise of a life-changing sum of money and blackmailed by his past, Blake must identify and stop the twisted murderer before their horrifying mission is completed.\n\nTake one portion of darkness, add a large handful of humour, sprinkle a helping of mystery on top, and you end up with Bubblegum Smoothie, the first book in the Blake Dent thriller series from Ryan Casey, author of the Brian McDone books","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee2dc1b2e440a754b08c254255f9baedbc40fcb","amp;dn":"Bubblegum+Smoothie+%5BA+Blake+Dent+Mystery%5D+-+Ryan+Casey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee2dc1b2e440a754b08c254255f9baedbc40fcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,226,220,27,46,68,10,117,75,8,194,84,37,95,155,174,219,196,15,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
