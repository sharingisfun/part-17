Channeling the desperation and depression of the Southern gothic movement better than most artists, they have reached a point where their music has evolved into a series of edgy Western soundscapes.  This is fine, as they take traditional country instruments and utilize them to craft Bauhaus-esque doom anthems.  &quot;Single Girl&quot; breaks the mold, sounding almost upbeat as singer David Eugene Edwards surrounds himself with layered vocals and a bouncy bass-driven tempo.  And &quot;La Robe a Parasol,&quot; the final track, is a lilting French waltz that finishes off the album with a last glimmer of hope.  But for the most part, this is a bleak journey into the backwoods, an aural equivalent to Clint Eastwood's grizzled Oscar-winning Unforgiven.  Like that film, this album has the same depressing resignation to a poor and unrewarding life and rarely attempts to glimpse the bright side of things.  And much like that film, the whole of the album also leaves the listener relieved, acting as a cathartic view of rural depression.  Although some fans may be disappointed with 16 Horsepower's move away from the frantic drive of the group's older material, this is a landmark in the subgenre of alt-country goth.  It's not a new direction for 16 Horsepower, but instead the band has further refined its sound and made it even more brooding and ominous than before.  ~ Bradley Torreano, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nDavid Eugene Edwards (Vocals, Guitar , Banjo, Violin, Accordion and Keyboards) \nPascal Humbert (Bass Guitar) \nJean -Yves Tola (Drums)\n\nSixteen Horsepower - Folklore Tracks:\n01  Hutterite Mile (David Eugene Edwards/Pascal Humbert/Jean-Yves Tola) 4:04 \n02  Outlaw Song (Hungarian traditional) 4:29\n03  Blessed Persistence (David Eugene Edwards/Pascal Humbert/Jean-Yves Tola) 4:06 \n04  Alone And Forsaken (Hank Williams) 2:49 \n05  Single Girl (Carter Family) 2:35 \n06  Beyond The Pale (David Eugene Edwards/Pascal Humbert/Jean-Yves Tola) 3:45\n07  Horse Head Fiddle (Tuvan traditional) 4:50 \n08  Sinnerman (American traditional) 4:15 \n09  Flutter (David Eugene Edwards/Pascal Humbert/Jean-Yves Tola) 4:04\n10  La Robe A Parasol (Traditional old time Mazurka) 2:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b112a13f578dc7c09bd52187618004be9046be44","amp;dn":"Sixteen+Horsepower+-+Folklore+%282002%29+%5BAlt+Country%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bscho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b112a13f578dc7c09bd52187618004be9046be44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,18,161,63,87,141,199,192,155,213,33,135,97,128,4,190,144,70,190,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
