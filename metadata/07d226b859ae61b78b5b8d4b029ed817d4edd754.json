(Well, it's not quite all guitarists; George Winston opens the disc with a piano reading of Fahey's &quot;Steamboat Gwine 'Round de Bend&quot; and concludes it with a harmonica version of same.) Inspired by hymns and early blues, Fahey's compositions have a stately, deliberate aura encompassing a sense of American time, affording one the impression that Fahey was hearing something just out of listening range of his fellow citizens. The music is -- no other word will do -- beautiful. Though evoking a lost past, it is, however, never sentimental, cloying or nostalgic.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
