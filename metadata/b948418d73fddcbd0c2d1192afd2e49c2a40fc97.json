This one consists of 26 volumes first published in book form in the 1950s and still in print today (Westminster/John Knox Press, very expensive), and widely used in seminaries and other academic settings.\n\nThe series includes volumes by Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther and John Calvin, as well as many lesser authors from the early Church through the medieval and reformation periods.  \n\nThese files are high quality .pdfs taken from the 2006 CD-ROM edition of the series.  As far as I know they are not available anywhere else on the web.\n\n(Please note that the .pdf bookmarks contain links to places on the CD-ROM that are not included in these files, so just ignore them.)\n\nThe publisher says this about the series:\n\nLong recognized for the quality of its translations, introductions, explanatory notes, and indexes, the Library of Christian Classics provides scholars and students with modern English translations of some of the most significant Christian theological texts in history. Through these worksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½each written prior to the end of the sixteenth centuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½contemporary readers are able to engage the ideas that have shaped Christian theology and the church through the centuries. The Library of Christian Classics ensures that this great literature of the Christian heritage is easily available and invites the ongoing development of theology.\n\nA listing of titles from the publisher catalog:\n\nLCCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Library of Christian Classics\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 9780664230791 Advocates of Reform.
