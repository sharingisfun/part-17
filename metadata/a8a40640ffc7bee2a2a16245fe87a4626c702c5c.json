This groundbreaking new study traces the history of British tribes and British tribal rivalries form the pre-Roman period, through the Roman period and into the post-Roman period. It shows how tribal conflict was central to the arrival of Roman power in Britain and how tribal identities persisted through the Roman period and were a factor in three great convulsions that struck Britain during the Roman centuries. It explores how tribal conflicts may have played a major role in the end of Roman Britain, creating a 'failed state' scenario asking in some ways to those seen recently in Bosnia and Iraq, and brought about the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons. Finally, it considers how British tribal territories and British tribal conflicts can be understood as the direct predecessors of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and Anglo-Saxon conflicts that form the basis of early English history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a40640ffc7bee2a2a16245fe87a4626c702c5c","amp;dn":"Britannia+-+The+Failed+State+By+Stuart+Laycock.+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a40640ffc7bee2a2a16245fe87a4626c702c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,164,6,64,255,199,190,226,162,161,98,69,254,135,164,98,108,112,44,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
