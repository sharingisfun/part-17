Below the zone of Orbital control, buttonheads, panzerjocks, dirtgirls, and hustlers scramble for their ticket out of the gravity well.\n\nBut now, if the criminal underworld and the guerilla underground can join forces, there is a chance to shift the balance of powerÃ¢â‚¬â€ in a war fought on the ground by hardwired commandos, in the air by high-flying deltajocks, and by genius hackers in the neural interface.\n\nAs Roger Zelazny said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“HardwiredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a tough, sleek juggernaut of a story, punctuated by strobe light movements, coursing to the wail of jets and the twang of steel guitarsÃ¢â‚¬â€ glittering, nasty, and nobleÃ¢â‚¬â€ and told in a style perfectly suiting its content. It has all of my favorite thingsÃ¢â‚¬â€ blood, love, fire, hate and a high ideal or two. I wish IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d written this one.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11bf5ed331a5e41b836b75fcfb17ef58d64cc3d3","amp;dn":"Walter+Jon+Williams+-+Hardwired","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11bf5ed331a5e41b836b75fcfb17ef58d64cc3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,191,94,211,49,165,228,27,131,107,117,252,251,23,239,88,214,76,195,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
