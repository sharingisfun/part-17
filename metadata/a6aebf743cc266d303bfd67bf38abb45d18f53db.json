Based on a novella by the celebrated Madame de Lafayette, the action centers on the love of Marie de MeziÃƒÂ¨res for her dashing cousin Henri de Guise, thwarted when her father's political ambitions force her into marriage with the well-connected Philippe de Montpensier, who she has never met. When Philippe is called away to fight, she is left in the care of Count Chabannes, an aging nobleman with a disdain for warfare, and soon becomes exposed to the sexual and political intrigues of court.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6aebf743cc266d303bfd67bf38abb45d18f53db","amp;dn":"La+Princesse+de+Montpensier+2010+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6aebf743cc266d303bfd67bf38abb45d18f53db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,174,191,116,60,194,102,211,3,191,214,123,243,138,187,69,209,143,83,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
