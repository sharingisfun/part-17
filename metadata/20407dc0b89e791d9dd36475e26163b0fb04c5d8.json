IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and \nreally enjoy reading runs of comics rather than as they come out \nmonth by month.  Maybe the demise (?) of Demonoid brought about \nthe end of the Chronological Packs I had been following.  Since \npack 27 came out in 2010  until a few months ago I had resisted \nreading the X-Men and Avengers, at least until AvX wrapped up. \nI then embarked on the task of putting together my own collection \nfrom where pack 27 left off.  Since I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen anyone else \nput up this material, and I went to all the effort, I figured I \nshould share.  I have 3 more packs to follow that should get \nclose to the current releases.  After that if there is interest, \nI could put out previous packs.\n\nMy ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m trying to \nfollow all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they \nappear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in \nan Avengers title, I include it, but if no mutants are included \nin a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool \nto be part of the mutant family, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see his stuff here \nalso.  I think the orders here work pretty well, but you can \nreorder stuff as you see fit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues \nI might have missed let me know.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll try to work them in.\n\nThese are not my scans.  IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been in awe of the folks that \nturn out such amazing scans and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find most scans are \ntagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.\n\nThese issues are from the Marvel Universe with various authors \nand illustrators.\n\nIssues are from 2011-2012\n\nThe format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the \nlanguage is ENGLISH\n\nHere are the specific issues to found herein:\n\nIron Age #1-3 + Alpha &amp; Omega\nDeadpool Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pulp #1-4\nWolverine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5 Ronin #1-5\nDeadpool MAX - #1-12 + X-Mas Special\nVengeance #1-6\nCarnage U.S.A. #1-5\nUncanny X-Men #1-3\nWolverine &amp; the X-Men #1-4\nAstonishing X-Men #43-47\nX-Men #20-23\nX-Men Legacy # 259-206.1\nNew Mutants #33-36\nGeneration Hope #13-17\nX-Club #1-5\nMagneto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Not A Hero #1-4\nAvengers Academy #22-26\nX-Men Evolutions #1\nNew Avengers #16.1-23\nAvengers #18-24.1 + Annual\nAlpha &amp; Omega #1-5\nDaken Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dark Wolverine #20-23\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20407dc0b89e791d9dd36475e26163b0fb04c5d8","amp;dn":"Chronological+X-Men+Pack+29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20407dc0b89e791d9dd36475e26163b0fb04c5d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,64,125,192,184,158,121,29,157,211,100,117,226,97,99,176,251,4,197,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
