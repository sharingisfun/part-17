Nellie tells Angela: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cake makes people happy. One bowl, one mixer, and the right company, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re set for life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThirty-five years later, Angela (Kimberly Elise) is a single, working mom with three teenage boys, Marcus (A.J. Saudin), William, (Stephan James) and Nicolas (Lamar Johnson). She juggles various jobs and helps with employment counseling at the local Mission. While thrilled to be in the family home where she learned to bake, the house is falling apart, with sections deemed uninhabitable by inspectors after storm and flood damage. Plus, the car just decided not to start Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the boys all still need shoes, books and food.\n\nShe has always made due until now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when her lender calls in the mortgage loan and puts her into foreclosure. Angela has 10 days to come up with $4000 or she loses her home. This is the true story of a woman who decides to bake 100 apple cakes and sell them at $40 each in order to save her home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and how this idea completely changes her and her family.\n\nAs word of her Ã¢â‚¬Å“bake saleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ripples out through neighbors, friends, her church and even old flames, such as Melvin (Kevin Hanchard), the story soon spreads to the news, locally, nationally and internationally. Orders fly in from all over the world. Angela is taken off guard by the overwhelming support. But soon, this fiercely independent woman learns to depend on the kindness and love of others that comes her way, particularly when the community and local businesses rally around Angela to help her finish and ship the initial stack of orders.\n\n\nCast: \n\nA.J.
