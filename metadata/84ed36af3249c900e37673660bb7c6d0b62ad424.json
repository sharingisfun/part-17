All three tunes soon became staples of FM radio. &quot;Reelin' In the\nYears&quot; also features an acclaimed guitar solo by Elliott Randall.\n\nBecause of Fagen's reluctance to sing live, David Palmer handled most of the vocal duties on\nstage. During the first tour, it became apparent to Katz and Becker that Palmer's\ninterpretation of the material wasn't having the same impact, and eventually convinced Fagen\nthat he was the one who best conveyed the attitude and meaning of the songs. Palmer\nquietly left the group during the recording of the second album, soon hooking up with Carole\nKing, with whom he wrote the 1974 #2 hit, &quot;Jazzman.&quot;\n\nThe lineup of Can't Buy a Thrill and its follow up, Countdown to Ecstasy, were very band\noriented. Denny Dias handled the rhythm guitar as well as the famous electric sitar solo on\n&quot;Do It Again,&quot; and Jeff Baxter handled lead guitar duties. Jim Hodder played drums as well as\nsinging on one track, &quot;Midnite Cruiser.&quot; As for Becker and Fagen themselves, Becker played\nbass and sang some sparse backup vocals while his partner Fagen played all keyboards\n(piano, electric piano, organ) and sang lead on every track but three.\n\n\n\n\n\n01.
