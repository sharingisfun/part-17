Candy, and the creepiness of Michelle Hodkin's The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer, Vivian Divine Is Dead will thrill fans of emotionally charged, fast-paced, contemporary fiction.\n\nTeen celebrity Vivian Divine has had a rough six monthsÃ¢â‚¬â€her movie-star mother was murdered, and her boyfriend cheated on her with her best friend. Through it all, she's had to smile for the cameraÃ¢â‚¬â€this is the stuff the tabloids live for, after all.\n\nWhen a death threat arrives with her fan mail, Vivian decides to run to Mexico, hoping to escape whoever it is who wants her dead. There, she finds an ally in the mysterious and charming Nick, but even he seems like he can't be trusted.As Vivian travels deeper into Mexico, she finds herself asking a horrifying question: If she can't hide from the paparazzi, what makes her think she can elude a madman?\n\nFilled with surprising twists, poignant moments, and the snark of a Hollywood starlet suddenly on her own, Vivian Divine Is Dead brings a fresh new voice to contemporary fiction.\n\nAs New York Times bestselling author of the Beautiful Creatures series Kami Garcia says, Vivian Divine Is Dead is &quot;a heartbreaking and magical story about love, second chances, and finding yourself.&quot;\n\n**\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGr 8 UpÃ¢â‚¬â€Someone is after Hollywood's &quot;it&quot; girl. Teen film star, Vivian Divine, has always followed in her famous mother's footstepsÃ¢â‚¬â€but this time, she'd rather not. Her mother was murdered six months ago, and when Vivian receives a mysterious death threat with alarming parallels to her mother's tragic end, she flees incognito to Mexico. The Hollywood princess is on her own and out of her element, trying to stay alive while unraveling the mystery of who's chasing her and why. Her odds of survival increase when she meets the attractive NickÃ¢â‚¬â€but he may not be who he seems. This action-packed novel is enjoyably quirky, though ambitiousÃ¢â‚¬â€there's a lot going on, and characterization takes a backseat to plot. The writing shines in the scenes of a richly described DÃƒÂ­a de los Muertos celebration, and Vivian's journey through rural Mexico will keep readers in suspense as the heroine faces danger at every turn. In the end, though, there's heavy reliance on coincidence. The story's climax plays out like a melodramaÃ¢â‚¬â€or, perhaps, given the setting, it's a self-aware reference to the plot twists of a telenovela, with shocking betrayals and dramatic reveals. It's hard to tell whether the book's tone is meant to be sincere or tongue-in-cheek. Still, this will appeal to readers looking for a fast-paced romp with suspense, action, and romanceÃ¢â‚¬â€with an encouraging message of self-actualization as Vivian learns she's capable of more than she knew.Ã¢â‚¬â€Allison Tran, Mission Viejo Library, CA\n\nFrom Booklist\n\nDespite the title, teen movie star Vivian Divine isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deadÃ¢â‚¬â€yet. Life in her seemingly ideal Hollywood world isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going great: VivianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boyfriend and costar cheats on her with her best friend, and she feels like no one really knows who she really is. But there are bigger problems afoot. Vivian receives a death threat, and now she is on the run from strange men who want to kill her, just like they killed her mother. When she has to make a dangerous trek to Mexico for safety and anonymity, she is surprised to find out how resilient, resourceful, and strong she really is. There are thrills and chills, both scary and romantic, as Vivian finds out the truth behind the glossy lies and falls for a darkly handsome stranger. The danger piles on fast and hard and feels both real and chilling through VivianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first-person narration. The teenage movie-star novel isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t new, but debut author Sabel adds a new spin to the shiny plastic movie world by revealing a gritty, violent underbelly.
