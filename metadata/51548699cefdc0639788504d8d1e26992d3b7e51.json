Still a good J-Core album by all regards, it has less success than 1,2, and 4. More emphasis on speedcore and gabber, which can be niche tastes.\n\nThe three big hits:\nNo Reason (Trance) - Joshka. Ranked right next to Serotonin 2008 (from Hardcore Syndrome 2) on last.fm, his other big hit.\nIrrelevance (Gabber) - USAO. This may be my favorite gabber track, from all of gabber. It ranks around fourth on USAO's last.fm playcounts.\nFuck Me Jesus (Gabber) - RoughSketch. Some really funky gabber, it's hard, it's noisy, and it has some really unique blending.\n\n01. No Reason - Joshka\n02. Remm - REDALiCE \n03. Drome (DJ Shimamura's 09 Update) - DJ Shimamura \n04. Stasis - Minamotoya Feat Motoko\n05. Syndrome of The Strange Country's Alice - REDALiCE vs DJ Technorch\n06. Tc-ma_011 - DJ Technetium\n07. Division 4 - Betwixt &amp; Between\n08. Conclude - DJ Noriken \n09. Sarcomite - Alabaster\n10. Astaleugo - Thanatos\n11. Innovatize Yourself - kenta-v.ez.\n12. Fuck Me Jesus - RoughSketch\n13. Irrelevance - USAO\n14. Tsugihagi Construction - t+pazolite\n\nTAGS:\nhardcore, syndrome, jcore, electronic, dance, music, happy, gabber, trance, house, japanese, bemani, redalice, ryu, usao ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51548699cefdc0639788504d8d1e26992d3b7e51","amp;dn":"Hardcore+Syndrome+3+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BTANOCD-0010%5D+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51548699cefdc0639788504d8d1e26992d3b7e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,84,134,153,206,253,192,99,151,136,80,77,141,30,38,153,45,59,126,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
