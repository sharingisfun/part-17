Tags: Climate change, Climatology, Earth Sciences, Environment, Global warming, Politics, Religion, Science,  Weather\n\nSome of Ian Wishart's books are crap but not this one. AIR CON is a good introduction to the current global warming/climate change scare. In covering the science behind global warming, warts and all, it is not overly scientific, and the discussion is still relevant in 2014. \n\n\nReview:\n=======\nAIR CON demonstrates, with hundreds of scientific references, that global warming was not, is not, and will not be a global crisis; that it is far more cost-effective to adapt as and if needed than to attempt to mitigate 'global warming' by cutting emissions of carbon dioxide; and that all attempts at mitigation would serve only to imprison the very poorest in their poverty, thereby perversely increasing world population and consequently the 'carbon footprint' of humankind, achieving an outcome precisely the opposite of that which was (however piously) intended. \n\nIan Wishart's book demonstrates that there is not the slightest scientific reason for the new, quasi-religious belief that The Planet needs Saving. The new religion is merely an excuse for world government. World government will not, repeat not, be democratic government. \n\nThe 'global warming' debate is not really a debate about climatologyÃ¢â‚¬â€it is a debate about freedom. It is the aim of the growing world-government faction among the international classe politique to take away our hard-won freedom and democracy forever. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Lord Christopher Monckton, Viscount of Brenchley, former scientific advisor to Margaret Thatcher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f8cb0301f7a5d10e260dbeeae00649f3ec0097","amp;dn":"Air+Con%3A+Truth+About+Global+Warming-Ian+Wishart+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f8cb0301f7a5d10e260dbeeae00649f3ec0097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,248,203,3,1,247,165,209,14,38,13,190,234,224,6,73,243,236,0,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
