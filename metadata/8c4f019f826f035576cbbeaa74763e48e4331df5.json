His employer Hanussen dreams of establishing an all-powerful Ministry of the Occult in Hitler's government. Yet as Hitler's hold on power grows more sure, and Berlin erupts in a ferment of anti-Semitism, Zishe must decide how he will use his strength. Plagued by nightmares, he takes counsel from a local rabbi. He becomes convinced that he has been chosen by God to warn his people of the grave danger they face.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c4f019f826f035576cbbeaa74763e48e4331df5","amp;dn":"Invincible+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c4f019f826f035576cbbeaa74763e48e4331df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,79,1,159,130,111,3,85,118,203,190,170,116,118,62,72,228,51,29,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
