The students performed unique versions of pop hits by the likes of The Beach Boys, David Bowie, and Paul McCartney. The recordings were quickly forgotten until Victoria record collector Brian Linds found the first record in a thrift store and sent it to author, WFMU radio DJ, and &quot;outsider music&quot; enthusiast Irwin Chusid in 2000. After ten label rejections, Irwin managed to get the album released on Bar/None Records, and it immediately created an international buzz, making many end-of-the-year best album lists in 2001. VH-1 coordinated a reunion of Fenger and dozens of his former students in 2002, and produced a documentary about the project.\n\nRichard Linklater's 2003 hit film School of Rock was inspired by the Langley CD.\n\nDiscography:\n\nLochiel, Glenwood, and South Carvolth Schools, 1976\n   1.

Coupled with the earnest if lugubrious vocal performance you have a piece of art that I couldn't have conceived of, even with half of Colombia's finest export products in me.&quot; - David Bowie (on &quot;Space Oddity&quot;)\n\n* &quot;The effect of all those young voices singing 'Calling Occupants' is charming.&quot; - Richard Carpenter, The Carpenters\n\n* &quot;When I heard about the Langley project, it seemed very interesting, but I did have the thought that it might sound like children singing off-key in a gym. The reality blew me away-- a haunting, evocative wall-of-sound experience that is affecting in an incredibly visceral way. What an amazing CD!&quot; - Fred Schneider, The B-52's\n\n* &quot;I find myself calling friends, turning The Langley Schools Music Project up really loud, holding the phone out and going, 'Can you hear that?' I put it on at odd times during the day, tuning it in and out, sometimes wincing as the singers hit a strange note, then shaking my head in puzzled wonder when the music suddenly, and against all odds, transcends the kitsch limitations that seem designed to keep it earthbound and soars off into the realm of true art. It flies -- crooked as a butterfly's flight, but it still flies. I wish every school taught music like this. I wish every piece of music recorded in a school gymnasium were this haunting... and then I suspect that, if I listened to them right, maybe they would be.&quot; - Neil Gaiman\n\n* &quot;I knew virtually nothing about conventional music education, and didn't know how to teach singing. Above all, I knew nothing of what children's music was supposed to be. But the kids had a grasp of what they liked: emotion, drama, and making music as a group. Whether the results were good, bad, in tune or out was no big deal -- they had ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lan. This was not the way music was traditionally taught. But then I never liked conventional 'children's music,' which is condescending and ignores the reality of children's lives, which can be dark and scary. These children hated 'cute.' They cherished songs that evoked loneliness and sadness.&quot; - Hans Fenger, Langley music supervisor/arranger\n\n\n-------------\n\nMP3s made with eyeD3, EasyTAG, and... I forget now because I had to try way to many programs just to set a good bitrate (Sound Juicer would only let me do 128kbps... grrr) it was something that didn't automatically do the tags hence the eyeD3 and easyTAG\n\nPictures and liner notes edited with GIMP\n\n19 tracks\nAudio\nMPEG 1 Audio, Layer 3 (MP3)\nStereo\n48000 Hz\nVariable Bit Rate\n\n--------------\nNuclear powered vacuuum cleaners will probably be a reality within 10 years.\n\t\t-- Alex Lewyt (President of the Lewyt Corporation,\n\t\t   manufacturers of vacuum cleaners), quoted in The New York\n\t\t   Times, June 10, 1955.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://carbusters.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://carbusters.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSupport your local Public Library!\n~PNC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d393d14e3ef6cbb34ecf088f3cefd0ba5321d6f0","amp;dn":"Langley+Schools+Music+Project+mp3+and+liner+PNC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d393d14e3ef6cbb34ecf088f3cefd0ba5321d6f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,147,209,78,62,246,203,179,78,207,8,143,60,239,208,186,83,33,214,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
