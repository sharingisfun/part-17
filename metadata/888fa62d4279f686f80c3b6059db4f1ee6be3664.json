After all, Arlene tried to have Sookie killed. But her relationship with Eric Northman is not so clearcut. He and his vampires are keeping their distance...and a cold silence. And when Sookie learns the reason why, she is devastated.\n\nThen a shocking murder rocks Bon Temps, and Sookie is arrested for the crime.\n\nBut the evidence against Sookie is weak, and she makes bail. Investigating the killing, she'll learn that what passes for truth in Bon Temps is only a convenient lie. What passes for justice is more spilled blood. And what passes for love is never enough...\n\n\n\nUploader's Notes: This is the book in .epub, .mobi, and .pdf formats. The cover included is from the UK version.
