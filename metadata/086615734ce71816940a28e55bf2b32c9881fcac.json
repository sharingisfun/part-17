Balthazar's Song (3:43)\n\nFor its first foray into contemporary music, Paradise of Bachelors is proud to present Poor Moon, the greatest Hiss Golden Messenger album to date.\n\nComposed and arranged by Head Messenger M.C. Taylor at his home in the rural Piedmont mill town of Pittsboro and recorded with longtime collaborator Scott Hirsch in New York, California and North Carolina, Poor Moon offers a moving culmination of the spiritually-charged song cycle commenced on last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s critically acclaimed Bad Debt album. Treading a red-clay road between Bad Debt and Country Hai East Cotton in sound and sentiment, it is the first fully electric ensemble recording since the highly limited HGM live release Root Work in 2010.\n\nFeaturing contributions from Terry Lonergan, Nathan Bowles (Black Twig Pickers; Pelt), Hans Chew (D. Charles Speer &amp; the Helix), Matt Cunitz (Brightblack Morning Light), Tom Heyman (The Court &amp; Spark), and others, Poor Moon represents both an elaboration and inversion of previous Hiss Golden Messenger efforts, proposing an America at perpetual sundown, wracked by devotion, wrecked by celebration. Named in homage to the Canned Heat track penned by the immortal Blind Owl, Poor Moon conjures the unsteady experience of soul at home in the wild, and it stands as a captivating document of Southern songcraft.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:086615734ce71816940a28e55bf2b32c9881fcac","amp;dn":"Hiss+Golden+Messenger...+Poor+Moon%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"086615734ce71816940a28e55bf2b32c9881fcac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,102,21,115,76,231,24,22,148,10,40,229,91,242,179,44,152,129,252,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
