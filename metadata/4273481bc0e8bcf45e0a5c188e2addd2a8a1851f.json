By imaging samples of AÎ² with Ultrasonic Force Microscopy, a detailed substructure to the morphology is revealed, which correlates well with the most advanced cryo-EM work. Early stage work in the area of thermal and spectroscopical AFM is also presented, and indicates the promise these techniques may hold for imaging sensitive and complex biological materials. This thesis demonstrates that physical techniques can be highly complementary when studying the aggregation of amyloid peptides, and allow the detection of subtle differences in their aggregation processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4273481bc0e8bcf45e0a5c188e2addd2a8a1851f","amp;dn":"Nanoscale+Imaging+and+Characterisation+of+Amyloid-%26beta%3B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4273481bc0e8bcf45e0a5c188e2addd2a8a1851f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,115,72,27,192,232,188,244,94,10,92,24,142,42,221,210,168,161,133,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
