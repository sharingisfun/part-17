Driven by revenge and a fierce desire to protect the moors over which she presides, Maleficent cruelly places an irrevocable curse upon the human kingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s newborn infant Aurora. As the child grows, Aurora is caught in the middle of the seething conflict between the forest kingdom she has grown to love and the human kingdom that holds her legacy. Maleficent realises that Aurora may hold the key to peace in the land and is forced to take drastic actions that will change both worlds forever.\n\n\n\n- Actors:\n\nAngelina Jolie\nSharlto Copley\nElle Fanning\nSam Riley\nImelda Staunton\nJuno Temple\nLesley Manville\nBrenton Thwaites\nKenneth Cranham\n\n\n\n- Director:\n\nRobert Stromberg\n\n\n\n- Audio:\n\nEnglish\nPortuguese BR\n\n\n\n- Subtitles:\n\nEnglish\nPortuguese BR\nSpanish\nArabic\n\n\n\n- Format:\n\n.m4v\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3040efd3ce0e17bf0ce691c9e176500f4062d72f","amp;dn":"Maleficent+%282014%29+1080p+for+iTunes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3040efd3ce0e17bf0ce691c9e176500f4062d72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,64,239,211,206,14,23,191,12,230,145,201,225,118,80,15,64,98,215,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
