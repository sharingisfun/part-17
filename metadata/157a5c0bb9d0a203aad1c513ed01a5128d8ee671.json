At the heart of the story are two people, Iris Courtney, who is white, and handsome Jinx Fairchild, the black basketball player who, in protecting Iris, kills a white man. Iris is the only witness to the crime. The two of them are growing up in the early 1950s in a New York industrial town where racial boundaries keep people apart--or bring them together in explosive scenes of fear or desire. The secret link between Iris and Jinx is not only their attraction to each other, but a murder ... and a bond of passion and guilt is formed between them. How this one irrevocable, tragic act shapes their lives and alters their destinies becomes Joyce Carol Oates' finest, emotion-packed novel--a work the critics are calling a masterpiece, the best work of America's best writer of contemporary realism.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157a5c0bb9d0a203aad1c513ed01a5128d8ee671","amp;dn":"Joyce+Carol+Oates+-+Because+It+Is+Bitter%2C+and+Because+...+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157a5c0bb9d0a203aad1c513ed01a5128d8ee671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,122,92,11,185,208,162,3,170,209,197,19,237,1,165,18,141,142,230,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
