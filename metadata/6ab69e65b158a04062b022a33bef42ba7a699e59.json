James Stewart, Jane Wyman, Kent Smith, Donald Meek\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039595/\r\n\r\n\r\nMagic Town follows Rip Smith, an opinion pollster who discovers a small town that exactly mirrors average public sentiment across America. Rather than wasting time and money collecting opinions from all over, he realises he can just take them from one town. The trick is, he has to make sure nothing changes in the town so that opinions will stay as average as possible - cue underhanded shenanigans. This doesn't sit well with pro-change character Mary Peterman - cue flirtatious bickering. Magic Town is a slightly forgotten James Stewart film that really should be better known, and is well worth seeing for any fan of It's a Wonderful Life. It is one of the first films about the then new science of public opinion polling.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 960x720, 23.976 fps, 2486 Kbps, 01h43m29s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nBRRip, English audio, optional subtitles English and Portuguese-Brazil\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6su1umf81/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9bu17fyj5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/5xburb34h/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/s6prxuykx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/g10kngjv5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab69e65b158a04062b022a33bef42ba7a699e59","amp;dn":"Magic+Town+%5B1947+-+USA%5D+%28James+Stewart%29+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab69e65b158a04062b022a33bef42ba7a699e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,182,158,101,177,88,160,64,98,176,34,163,59,239,66,186,122,105,158,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
