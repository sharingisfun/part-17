But Jacques Beaulieu and his family have other plans for Yannick. Beaulieu is a self-righteous psychopath and fanatical chess player who wants to rid the world of &quot;evil&quot;. And even though Yan has done nothing wrong, he is beaten, tortured and tormented before Beaulieu makes him an offer: win at chess and he is free to go. And so Yannick is now a pawn in Beaulieu's game. A game in which he will either lose his mind or his life.\n\nRuntime......: 110 Min\nSource.......: DVD9\nResolution...: 720x304\nSA...........: BVOP: YES QPEL: NO GMC: NO\nFramerate....: 23.976 NTSC\nVideo........: 1424 Kbps\nAudio........: 448 Kbps AC3 5.1\nEncoder......: oZi\nLanguage.....: French\nSubtitles....: English (SRT)\n\ncredit ViSiON &amp; oZi &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5588c44da061a33701469a0b8236b272d1afb108","amp;dn":"5150.Elms.Way.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON%28ENG+SUBS%29+5150+Rue+des+Orme","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5588c44da061a33701469a0b8236b272d1afb108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,136,196,77,160,97,163,55,1,70,154,11,130,54,178,114,209,175,177,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
