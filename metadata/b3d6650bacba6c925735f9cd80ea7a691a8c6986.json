Unfortunately, unlike his siblings, Arthur hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t broken a single, solitary world record! But when the Whipples suffer a spate of catastrophes and a curious amount of attention from a pair of irregularly sized and unusually menacing clowns, Arthur might be the only one who can save his family from losing their collective crown . . . or worse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3d6650bacba6c925735f9cd80ea7a691a8c6986","amp;dn":"The+Fantastic+Family+Whipple+-+Matthew+Ward.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3d6650bacba6c925735f9cd80ea7a691a8c6986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,214,101,11,172,186,108,146,87,53,249,205,128,234,122,105,26,140,105,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
