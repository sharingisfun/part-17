Recorded the previous year at the famed Cincinnati venue (but not released until 1991), Ludlow catches the band in the moments just before their peak. Some of the material will be familiar to fans, but this collection adds gems such as John Lee Hooker's &quot;Dimples&quot; and the blues classic &quot;I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town&quot; to their recorded repertoire. And if you thought the 33-minute &quot;Mountain Jam&quot; on Eat a Peach was extensive, you need to hear Ludlow's 44-minute version, which comprises the entire second CD.\n --Marc Greilsamer\n\n\n\n\nNot as great sonically as The Fillmore concerts, but still an outstanding live album. This one and The Fillmore should be in any ABB collection. One disc 1 you get an 8 minute version of Statesboro Blues, over 10 minutes of Dreams an outstanding cover John Lee Hooker's Dimples, Berry Oakley doing lead vocals on Hoochie Coochie Man. On disc 2 is the 44 min epic Mountain Jam which I absolutely love, I think it's better than the Fillmore Concerts version. Like one reviewer said this disc could stand to be re-mastered and hopefully with extra songs. Even if it doesn't get the re-mastered treatment you should definately buy this.\n\n[Amazon user]\n\n\nCd-1\n\n1. Dreams\n2. Statesboro Blues\n3. Trouble No More\n4. Dimples\n5.
