Effects of most frequent sources of ground vibration arising from construction/demolition, traffic and machinery, ground wave amplification and attenuation as well as foundation kinematic and inertial interaction have been considered by simplified analyses aimed at ease and speed of use for major problems in ground vibration engineering. Comments on assumptions, limitations, and factors affecting the results are given. Case studies and examples worldwide are included to illustrate the accuracy and usefulness of simplified methods. A list of references is provided for further consideration, if desired.\n\nAudience: This work is of interest to geotechnical engineers, engineering geologists, earthquake engineers and students.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 251 pages\nPublisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (July 22 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9048190819\nISBN-13: 978-9048190812\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a32820a52ab7c5d90afcd5be604fe08a333ca94b","amp;dn":"Ground+Vibration+Engineering%3A++Simplified+Analyses+with+Case+Stu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a32820a52ab7c5d90afcd5be604fe08a333ca94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,40,32,165,42,183,197,217,10,252,213,190,96,79,224,138,51,60,169,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
