From desertification to rising ocean levels, from killer storms to wildlife extinction, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already seeing the effects of human activity on the most sensitive part of the global ecosystem. In this extraordinary book, Tim Flannery not only describes the problem of global warming and climate change, he suggests in detail how the world can act to solve it.\n\nMore than just a #1 bestseller across Canada, The Weather Makers is an international publishing phenomenon that has won praise from critics, scientists and world leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Australian Prime Minister John Howard. FlanneryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear explanations and practical suggestions bring an issue of monumental scope and importance down to the individual level, making us aware of how everyday activities contribute to climate change and what we can do, personally and collectively, to work against this urgent crisis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b5c4ae4585d4f456d020ccc4f4e46c000f7add","amp;dn":"The+Weather+Makers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b5c4ae4585d4f456d020ccc4f4e46c000f7add","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,181,196,174,69,133,212,244,86,208,32,204,196,244,228,108,0,15,122,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
