The authors' approach is very reader-friendly and avoids\nthe &quot;scholarly tone&quot; found in many books on this topic.\n\n\n* Focuses  on enumeration  and combinatorial  thinking as a  way to  develop a\n  variety of effective approaches to solving counting problems\n\n* Includes brief  summaries of basic concepts from  probability, power series,\n  and group theory to show how combinatorics interacts with other fields\n\n* Provides abstract ideas that are  grounded in familiar concrete settings and\n  features plentiful diagrams throughout to further add in reader understanding\n\n*  Presents simple  and  helpful notations  as needed,  and  simple cases  are\n   treated first before more general and/or advanced cases\n\n* Contains over  700 exercise sets, ranging from the  routine to the advanced,\n  with  either hints,  short answers,  or  complete solutions  for odd  numbered\n  problems.  An Instructor's  Manual (available  via request  to the  Publisher)\n  provides complete solutions for all exercises\n\n\nContents\n========\n\n  PART I THE BASICS OF ENUMERATIVE COMBINATORICS\n\n    1 Initial Encounters with Combinatorial Reasoning\n    2 Selections, Arrangements, and Distributions\n    3 Binomial Series and Generating Functions\n    4 Alternating Sums, Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, Rook Polynomials,\n      and Fibonacci Nim\n    5 Recurrence Relations\n    6 Special Numbers\n\n\n  PART II TWO ADDITIONAL TOPICS IN ENUMERATION\n\n    7 Linear Spaces and Recurrence Sequences\n    8 Counting with Symmetries\n\n\n  PART III NOTATIONS INDEX, APPENDICES, AND SOLUTIONS TO SELECTED ODD PROBLEMS\n\n    Index of Notations\n\n    Appendix A Mathematical Induction\n\n      A.1 Principle of Mathematical Induction\n      A.2 Principle of Strong Induction\n      A.3 Well Ordering Principle\n\n    Appendix B Searching the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)\n\n      B.1 Searching a Sequence\n      B.2 Searching an Array\n      B.3 Other Searches\n      B.4 Beginnings of OEIS\n\n    Appendix C Generalized Vandermonde Determinants\n\n    Hints, Short Answers, and Complete Solutions to Selected Odd Problems\n\n\nAuthors\n=======\n\nDuane DeTemple, PHD, is Professor Emeritus in the Department of Mathematics at\nWashington State University (WSU).\n\nHe  is the  recipient of  the  2007 WSU  Sahlin Faculty  Excellence Award  for\nInstruction  as well  as the  Distinguished  Teaching Award  from the  Pacific\nNorthwest Section of the Mathematical Association of America.\n\n...\n\nWilliam  Webb,  PHD,  is  Professor   in  the  Department  of  Mathematics  at\nWashington  State  University  and  President of  the  Fibonacci  Association.\n\nHis  research interests  include the  properties of  recurrence sequences  and\nbinomial coefficients.
