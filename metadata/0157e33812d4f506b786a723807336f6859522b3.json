I got rid of the low bitrate MP3s and found higher quality ones, so the vast majority of these are 256K to 320K quality. I did my best in correcting titles and gibberish titles from songs already out there on TPB. Mind you, I don't read or write Korean (yet) so I assume the anglicized titles are correct(?), while the MP3s in Hangul I looked up on artist sites and got the English translation so they would appear in English in my playlist. I also corrected all the MPS tags so they reflect the correct title &amp; group along with matching album art. Of course a few are still Hangul. Also, there are a couple duplicates, some album art doesn't reflect the real album art as there is so much fan-based album covers I didn't know what was real and not. It took me a lot of time but I love listening and figured you would too! I love Korean Dramas (and Taiwanese) and their soundtracks, and have included a few of these in there as well. \n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0157e33812d4f506b786a723807336f6859522b3","amp;dn":"K-pop+music+2157+Korean+pop+songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0157e33812d4f506b786a723807336f6859522b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,87,227,56,18,212,245,6,183,134,167,35,128,115,54,246,133,149,34,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
