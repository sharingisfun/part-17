Though Ivy has recently passed on, the members still meet regularly at her fiber and fabric shop, The WeaverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cat, which Kath has now inherited. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only the first in a series of surprises when Kath returns to the small town of Blue Plum, Tennessee, to settle her grandmotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affairs.\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a murder, and it turns out her grandmother was the prime suspect. Before she can begin to clear IvyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name, Kath encounters a looming presence in the form of a gloomy ghost. It turns out the specter has just as much interest in solving the murder as Kath. So, with a little help from the members of TGIFÃ¢â‚¬â€and a stubborn spirit from beyondÃ¢â‚¬â€she sets out to unravel the clues and hook the real killer.Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n#2 Dyeing Wishes \nKath RutledgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandmother left her a charming fiber and fabric shop, a close-knit group of needlework lovers, and a television-addicted ghost in the attic. She may also have inherited the special skills required to untangle a murder.\nAlways up for trying something new, Kath and her friends from the fiber and needlework group TGIFÃ¢â‚¬â€Thank Goodness itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FiberÃ¢â‚¬â€are visiting Cloud Hollow Farm for the day to learn the fine art of dyeing. With spring in the air, the friends head out to greet the sheep. But the sheep are more interested in something elseÃ¢â‚¬â€two bodies spread under a tall tree. And one of those bodies is someone they know.\nKathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends nudge her to investigate, and no one is more adamant than Geneva, the ghost who loves to play assistant sleuth. But when Kath discovers another murder cut from the same cloth, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more determined than ever to hang a roving killer out to dryÃ‚â€¦...\n\n#3 Spinning In Her Grave \nKath Rutledge is settling in as the owner of the Weaver's Cat, a fiber and fabric shop in Blue Plum, Tennessee. But nothing, not even the ghost haunting her shop, prepares her for the mystery that will leave the whole town spinning....\n\nIt's time for Blue Plum's annual historical festival, and everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€including Kath and her spunky fiber and needlework group, TGIFÃ¢â‚¬â€is getting in on the action. Expert spinners are being gathered, and a businessman has approached Kath about using the second-floor windows of her store for part of a reenactment. But the reenactment ends in real-life bloodshed when local baker Reva Louise Snapp is shotÃ¢â‚¬â€with a bullet from a modern-day gun.\n\nKath has her theories about who wanted to end Reva Louise's life. But there's also talk of a sniper stalking Blue Plum, and Kath's shop is suspected to be the murderer's hideout. Now Kath, her TGIF pals, and the gloomy ghost, Geneva, must unravel the mystery quickly, or someone else might be left hanging by a thread....\n\nAbout the Author\nMolly MacRae spent twenty years in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Upper East Tennessee, where she managed The Book Place, an independent bookstore; may it rest in peace. \nBefore the lure of books hooked her, she was curator of the history museum in Jonesborough, TennesseeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest town. \nMacRae lives with her family in Champaign, Illinois, where she connects children with books at the public library. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f3c82648175ca81b6f06184d8543a680428796","amp;dn":"A+Haunted+Yarn+Shop+Mystery+-+Molly+MacRae","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f3c82648175ca81b6f06184d8543a680428796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,243,200,38,72,23,92,168,27,111,6,24,77,133,67,166,128,66,135,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
