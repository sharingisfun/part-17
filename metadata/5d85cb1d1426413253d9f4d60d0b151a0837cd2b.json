For five thousand years, GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chosen people have cornered the market on knee-slappers, zingers, and knock-knock jokes. Now Old Jews Telling Jokes mines mothers, fathers, bubbies, and zaydes for comic gelt. What we get are jokes that are funnier than a pie in the punim: Abie and Becky jokes; hilarious rabbi, doctor, and mohel tales; and those bits just for Mom (Q: WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the difference between a Jewish mother and a Rottweiler? A: Eventually a Rottweiler will let go!). Some are just naughty and some are downright bawdyÃ¢â‚¬â€but either way youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll laugh till you plotz. With Borscht Belt gags from Brooklyn to Bel Air to Boca, Old Jews Telling Jokes is like chicken soup for your funny bone. I mean, would it kill you to laugh a little?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d85cb1d1426413253d9f4d60d0b151a0837cd2b","amp;dn":"Old+Jews+Telling+Jokes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d85cb1d1426413253d9f4d60d0b151a0837cd2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,133,203,29,20,38,65,50,83,217,244,214,13,11,21,26,8,55,205,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
