This is a shame, as Chapeau  is a delightful and charming little affair; while those not used to silent films will have to concentrate a bit harder to pick up the details of its involved plot, it's well worth the effort. Director/adaptor RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Clair  has done a marvelous job of capturing those details and of heaping one plot development on top of another in classic farce fashion, until the entire proceedings come tumbling down and all gets resolved. Yet Clair  makes sure that the plot mechanics don't result in a mechanical film. He imbues scenes with lovely little moments, lingering a bit longer after the main actors have left a scene or capturing a delicate arch of an eyebrow that other directors might have missed. He also adds a welcome surreal touch during the sequence in which the hero is fearing that the worst has happened to his beautiful home, but is equally at home with the mundane. (As an example of the latter, the sequence in which a wife is trying to get her husband to pay attention to an undone collar is beautifully realized and quite funny.) Clair's cast is near-perfect, anchored by the sterling &quot;little man&quot; comic performance of Albert Prejean. An Italian Straw Hat is both sweet and amusing, a lovely combination. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Un chapeau de paille d'Italie.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.42 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 927 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate : 1 529 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.215\n      Stream size : 1.13 GiB (79%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 145 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 45mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 145 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018523/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018523/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSilent, with English intertitles\n\nFrench, Spanhish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nDual audio - musical score (orchestra or piano)\n\nMy rip\n\nRene Clair - Un chapeau de paille d'Italie (1928)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e87c42172bbb2c6fd8b57b2ae65740572020e29","amp;dn":"Rene+Clair+-+Un+chapeau+de+paille+d%5C%27Italie+%281928%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e87c42172bbb2c6fd8b57b2ae65740572020e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,135,196,33,114,187,178,198,253,139,87,178,174,101,116,5,114,2,14,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
