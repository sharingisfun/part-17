The Platinum-certified album's title track hit No. 1 on the Country Singles chart and peaked at No. 26 on the Hot 100, and the song earned two Grammy Awards for Campbell: Best Vocal Performance, Male and Best Contemporary Solo Vocal Performance.\n\n\n Glen Campbell's commercial breakthrough came by way of the title track, which was the direct precursor in production terms to &quot;Wichita Lineman,&quot; and by the same writer. The cover of Paul Simon's &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; is sincere if a little perfunctory, but Campbell's rendition of Ernest Tubb's &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot; is a bravura performance, rich and soulful, as well as recalling Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein's &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; as done by Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers. &quot;Cold December in Your Heart&quot; harks back to Campbell's country-folk material, a piece of midtempo country-pop. Material like that and the similar &quot;Back in the Race,&quot; Dorsey Burnette's &quot;Hey Little One,&quot; Jerry Reed's &quot;You're Young and You'll Forget,&quot; and Bill Anderson's &quot;Bad Seed&quot; hold up better than more pop-focused numbers like &quot;My Baby's Gone,&quot; though the string backings on most of these very much date them. The final number here, the touching &quot;Love Is a Lonesome River,&quot; makes a brilliant coda. By the Time I Get to Phoenix was reissued in August of 2001 in a newly remastered, upgraded edition, with somewhat crisper sound, as part of Capitol-Nashville's Cornerstones series.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - By The Time I Get To Phoenix\n 02 - Homeward Bound\n 03 - Tomorrow Never Comes\n 04 - Cold December (In Your Heart)\n 05 - My Baby's Gone\n 06 - Back In The Race\n 07 - Hey Little One\n 08 - Bad Seed\n 09 - I'll Be Lucky Someday\n 10 - You're Young and You'll Forget\n 11 - Love Is A Lonesome River\n\nMusicians:\n Glen Campbell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, acoustic guitar\n James Burton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ acoustic guitar, electric guitars\n Joe Osborn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n Jim Gordon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13008d5ea6fcb23c454e4488a200db0e9abcc7f6","amp;dn":"Glen+Campbell+-+By+The+Time+I+Get+To+Phoenix+%281967%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13008d5ea6fcb23c454e4488a200db0e9abcc7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,0,141,94,166,252,178,60,69,78,68,136,162,0,219,14,154,188,199,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
