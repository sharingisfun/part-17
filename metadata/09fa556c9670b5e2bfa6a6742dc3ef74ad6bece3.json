Most well-known for his character models, animations, and plan files while at id Software (Quake II, Quake III Arena, and Quake III Team Arena), he also worked on the Wing Commander series at Origin Systems. As a producer at WildTangent, he used the Internet to unleash a small but popular online-delivered, Tempest-inspired third-person shooter called Betty Bad. His popular dancing girl visualizers that work with the Winamp plug-in remain some of the most highly downloaded pieces of content. Steed has written articles for Game Developer magazine and tutorials for his &quot;Thinking Outside the Box&quot; column on Loonygames.com. He is a frequent speaker at the annual Game Developer Conference and is into-high polygon women, his family, his truck, and playing pool.
