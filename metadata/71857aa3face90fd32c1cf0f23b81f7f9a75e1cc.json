Goat Mountain is what this family owns and where they belong. It is where their history is kept, memories and stories that will be shared again by these men. And for the first time, the boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story will be added if he can find a buck. Itching to shoot, he is ready.\n\nWhen the men arrive at the gate to their land, the father discovers a poacher and sights him through the scope of his gun. He offers his son a look-a simple act that will explode in tragedy, transforming these men and this family, forcing them to question themselves and everything they thought they knew.\n\nIn prose devastating and beautiful in its precision, David Vann creates a haunting and provocative novel that explores our most primal urges and beliefs, the bonds of blood and religion that define and secure us, and the consequences of our actions-what we owe for what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done.\nGenre: Contemporary Literary Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71857aa3face90fd32c1cf0f23b81f7f9a75e1cc","amp;dn":"Goat+Mountain_+A+Novel+-+David+Vann.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71857aa3face90fd32c1cf0f23b81f7f9a75e1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,133,122,163,250,206,144,253,50,193,207,15,35,184,31,127,154,117,225,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
