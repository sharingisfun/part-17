The lean, spidery guitar and organ riffs interweave with a hypnotic menace, providing a seductive backdrop for Jim Morrison&amp;#039;s captivating vocals and probing prose. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; was the cut that topped the charts and established the group as stars, but most of the rest of the album is just as impressive, including some of their best songs: the propulsive &quot;Break On Through&quot; (their first single), the beguiling Oriental mystery of &quot;The Crystal Ship,&quot; the mysterious &quot;End of the Night,&quot; &quot;Take It as It Comes&quot; (one of several tunes besides &quot;Light My Fire&quot; that also had hit potential), and the stomping rock of &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Twentieth Century Fox.&quot; The 11-minute Oedipal drama &quot;The End&quot; was the group at its most daring and, some would contend, overambitious. It was nonetheless a haunting cap to an album whose nonstop melodicism and dynamic tension would never be equaled by the group again, let alone bettered.\n\nOriginally released as part of the completed recorded works 2006 box set Perception, this deluxe edition of the Doors&amp;#039; classic 1967 debut is a double-disc set containing one CD featuring a newly remastered version of the album with bonus tracks and a DVD with a 5.1 Surround mix, bonus video footage, and a photo gallery. Given that the Doors catalog was remastered just seven years before this box, the sonics of these 2006s remasters are noticeable but not radically different -- with the exception of The Doors, for research revealed that the debut was mastered a half-speed slow and this edition restores it to its correct speed. It&amp;#039;s a subtle but significant difference, as opposed to the rest of the remasters, which are subtle but only significant to audiophiles who know this music intimately. Similarly, the bonus tracks are not major revelations: two takes of &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; plus a vocal version of &quot;Indian Summer,&quot; while the videos include &quot;Break on Through&quot; and a Toronto television broadcast of &quot;The End&quot; from 1967. Just because these aren&amp;#039;t big revelations doesn&amp;#039;t mean that this deluxe edition doesn&amp;#039;t live up to its title: this is the best-sounding, best-presented reissue of this album yet.\n\nThe songs &quot;Break on Through (To the Other Side)&quot; and &quot;The End&quot; were both released censored with the album. During &quot;Break on Through&quot; the part where Jim Morrison sings &quot;She gets, she gets&quot; was originally recorded as &quot;She gets high.&quot; The interlude singing part near the end of &quot;The End&quot; was censored and taken out. It included Jim using the word fuck over and over. Subsequent releases of the album have both of the original parts intact, although 1980s compact disc reissues appear to keep the verses censored. The band accepted this censorship but would supposedly refuse later to reword &quot;Light my Fire&quot; in the infamous Ed Sullivan Show (&quot;Girl we couldn&amp;#039;t get much higher&quot;), although according to Ray Manzarek, while singing this song, Jim Morrison simply forgot to replace the word.\n\nThe album&amp;#039;s dark tone and frontman Jim Morrison&amp;#039;s sexual charisma and wild lifestyle influenced much of rock and roll to come.\n\nThe album is generally thought of as the band&amp;#039;s best work, in addition to being one of the greatest debut albums by any band. It&amp;#039;s also considered to be one of the quintessential albums of the counterculture movement/Social Revolution. In 1998 Q magazine readers voted The Doors the 93rd greatest album of all time; in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 60. In 2003, the album was ranked number 42 on Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBREAK ON THROUGH (TO THE OTHER SIDE)\n\nThis short track fittingly commences the Doors debut album and single with itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ direct agenda of pushing all envelopes and exploring all facets of existence. A daunting task that the band -- under the lyrical and spiritual leadership of Jim Morrison -- were ready to take on. Musically, the Doors unique, undeniably fresh and somewhat punk perspective, fused the mind altering ideas of psychedelia with the intricate musicianship of jazz as well as the vibe of the burgeoning youth underground -- somehow creating a sound that defined an era of rock and roll.\n\nImmediately the lyrics indicate that something is different. For example, MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use of the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdestroyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdivideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to invoke images of day and night, reveal a literacy that had rarely been incorporated into rock music. Break On ThroughÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is structured like a love song. However, MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s phraseology cleverly juxtaposes romantic lyrics such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI found an island in your arms/A country in your eyesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the almost sinister lines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œarms that chain/Eyes that lieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nMusically, the Latin-derived opening -- courtesy of drummer John Densmore -- draws the listener in. It builds with Ray ManzareksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ throbbing bass pedals and Robbie KriegerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understated lead guitar. Suddenly, the band turn a corner and sonically explode behind MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frenetic lead vocals, shouting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBreak on through to the other sideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Instead of MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s punk sneer and growl flying in the face of their image as an acid-dropping psychedelic hippie band, it serves as a wake up call to all concerned parties that the social rules -- both spoken and understood -- have radically changed and are no longer what they may seem. This was in essence what the Doors were all about.\n\nElektra Records censors objected to the use of the word &quot;high&quot; in the middle section of the song (after &quot;everybody loves my baby&quot;) due to its drug connotations. The original album version has the line &quot;she gets&quot; repeated before a grunt at the end. Live versions and later releases of the song have the uncensored version with &quot;high&quot; restored.\n\nTHE CRYSTAL SHIP\n\nIt is regarded as a goodbye love song to Jim Morrison&amp;#039;s first love, Mary Werbelo. Like much of The Doors&amp;#039; work, it sets up an eerie, dark flow. It&amp;#039;s rumored to have been the band&amp;#039;s first long song, especially for Ray Manzarek&amp;#039;s and Robby Krieger&amp;#039;s improvisations, but was changed by When The Music&amp;#039;s Over.\n\nThe inspiration for the &quot;crystal ship&quot; is an oil rig off of Sand&amp;#039;s beach in Isla Vista, California. John Densmore &quot;co-writer&quot; states: &quot;Jim wrote The Crystal Ship for Mary Werbelo in 1964, a girlfriend with whom he was breaking up, it was in his famous notebook of poetry he had when we formed. (sic),. . . . The song was a goodbye love song.&quot;\n\nThe song was covered by Duran Duran for their 1995 covers album Thank You. It was also covered by pianist George Winston on his album Night Divides the Day - The Music of the Doors.\n\nThe song also appears on The X-files Movie Soundtrack by X.\n\nThe song has also appeared in television. An episode of Supernatural (TV series) -season two&amp;#039;s Born Under a Bad Sign- uses the song in a particularly dark setting.\n\nJoe Perry covered the song on his 2005 eponymous debut album.\n\nDuring the &amp;#039;70&amp;#039;s and early &amp;#039;80&amp;#039;s, there was a popular Doors cover band from New Jersey called &quot;The Crystal Ship.&quot; The band played mid-sized venues in the tri-state area, like &quot;Mother&amp;#039;s&quot; in Wayne, NJ, &quot;Great Gildersleeves&quot; in Manhattan, &quot;My Father&amp;#039;s Place&quot;, in Roslyn, Long Island, and &quot;Jimmy Burns&amp;#039;&quot; at the Jersey Shore. The band was formed in Hawthorne, NJ, and played its first few gigs at a biker bar in Paterson called the Highland Tavern. The lead singer&amp;#039;s name was Joe Vitagliano.\n\nIn the beginning of the song Bitchin&amp;#039; Camaro by the punk rock group the Dead Milkmen one character explains to the other that while at the Jersey Shore, he plans on seeing his favorite Doors cover band Crystal Shit. This is likely a reference to the Doors cover band, The Crystal Ship.\n\nIn the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas a radio DJ (played by Guns N&amp;#039; Roses lead singer Axl Rose) states that he used to be in a band called Crystal Ship. This is most likely a reference to the New Jersey cover band as well.\n\nJapanese psychedelic band Suishou no Fune&amp;#039;s name translates to &quot;Crystal Ship&quot;\n\nNicole Atkins covered this song on her 2008 album Nicole Atkins Digs Other People&amp;#039;s Songs.\n\nALABAMA SONG\n\nThe &quot;Alabama Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Whiskey Bar&quot;) was originally published in Bertolt Brecht&amp;#039;s Hauspostille (1927). It was set to music by Kurt Weill for the 1927 &quot;Songspiel&quot; Mahagonny and used again in Weill&amp;#039;s and Brecht&amp;#039;s 1930 opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny. In the latter, it is performed by the character Jenny and her fellow prostitutes in the first act. Musically it contains elements of foxtrot, blues and advanced soprano coloraturas, sung by Jenny.\n\nThe song style is typical of German schlager music, which was popular in Europe during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe lyrics for the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; are in English (albeit specifically idiosyncratic English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original German.\n\nJim Morrison, changed the second verse from:\nShow us the way to the next pretty boy to Show me the way to the next little girl.\n\nThe first verse was:\n\nShow me the way to the next Whiskey bar,\n\nwhich David Bowie sang as:\n\nShow us the way to the next whiskey bar,\n\nIn the late 1970s (thereby matching how the line read in Brecht&amp;#039;s Hauspostille before being part of the Mahagonny works). Bowie began performing his take on &quot;Alabama Song&quot; on his 1978 tour and released a studio version the following year. The Doors&amp;#039; version appeared on the first season of WKRP in Cincinnati in the episode &quot;Fish Story&quot;.\n\n\nLIGHT MY FIRE\n\nfrom allmusicguide:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLight My FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- from the quartetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-titled debut LP -- is the track that propelled the Doors onto the charts and into the collective consciousness of rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll. The undeniably catchy melody and pulsating Bossa Nova rhythms support MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obvious and blatantly sexual lyrics.\n\nAlthough the song is officially credited to the band, it was actually guitarist Robbie Krieger who came up with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢mon baby, light my fire ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ hook. The performance however is a group effort in the classic sense, as they symbiotically propel each other into some remarkably intense and emotionally charged interaction. This is not only true of the studio version, as the presence of a live audience often intensified the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resolve. Specifically, the instrumental trioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s improvisational skills are honed when coupled with their uncanny ability to instinctually support MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mostly non-verbal and inaudible cues.\n\nBetween the verses, are some definitive psychedelic solos. Ray Manzarekmelodically swirls his eerie and intricate leads through the spaces opened up in John DensmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fluid jazz and Eastern-influenced drumming. Krieger follows suit with some incendiary fretwork that challenges and ultimately steers his solo into a staccato phrase that instrumentally reunites the trio as they reconvene for the final verse and chorus.\n\nThe Doors topped the charts with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLight My FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and it became both a fan favourite and live staple. The track has a colourful performance history as well -- highlighted by their first -- and likewise their last -- appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. Legend has it that after promising -- and subsequently reneging -- to replace the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhigherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, during the live coast-to-coast broadcast, the Doors were ex communicated from ever appearing on the weekly variety show again. There are also numerous live recordings of the track on a variety of archival releases. Of particular note are the ^Live at the Aquarius Theatre: The Second erformance (2000) and Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1987) renderings.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLight My FireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has become synonymous with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s psychedelic and sexual revolutions. It has been covered by a wide spectrum of talent, ranging from Calvert DeForrest [AKA Larry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Melman] to Jackie Wilson and Woody Herman. However, with the notable exception of Jose FelicianoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chart topping version, none of the covers capture the raw interaction of the original.\n\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nThe song originated as a Robby Krieger unfinished composition, which the other band members then expanded upon. There was also a radio edit that was shortened to just under five minutes with about half the instrumental portion in place, released only to radio stations. Indeed, the band always stated that their preferred version was the original long version, while the shorter ones were solely produced at their company&amp;#039;s request in order to be able to receive radio airplay.\n\n&quot;Light My Fire&quot; was performed by The Doors on a famous appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show September 17, 1967. In an oft-told legend, The Doors were asked to change the lyrics of the song (specifically, the line &quot;girl, we couldn&amp;#039;t get much higher&quot;). The producers told Morrison to write a new lyric for the line, but he refused. The band promised to do so, but according to Jim Morrison he forgot to change the lyrics at the last minute and performed the unedited version live on-air, which he attributed to having been nervous. Years later, Ray Manzarek wrote that even after being told to change the lyrics, the band never even considered changing them. Despite applause from the crowd, Ed Sullivan was so upset that he refused to shake Morrison&amp;#039;s hand as he left the stage. Backstage, the band was told that, despite being on the verge of signing a seven-episode deal to continue appearing on the program, they would never be on the Sullivan show again. Reportedly, Morrison&amp;#039;s cavalier response was: &quot;Hey, man, so what, we just did the Sullivan show!&quot;\n\nJohn Densmore recalls that when Buick wanted to buy the piece for use in a 1968 TV commercial (&quot;Come on, Buick, light my fire&quot;) and Morrison, who had been out of town, learned that other group members agreed, Morrison called Buick and threatened to have a Buick smashed with a sledgehammer on a TV show should the (presumably ready) commercial be aired.\n\nBACK DOOR MAN\n\nIn southern culture, the phrase &quot;back-door man&quot; refers to a man having an affair with a married woman, using the back door as an exit before the husband comes home. &quot;When everybody trying to sleep, I&amp;#039;m somewhere making my midnight creep. / Every morning the rooster crow, something tell me I got to go / I am a back door man&quot;, Wolf sings. The promiscuous &quot;back-door man&quot; is a standard theme found in many blues, including those by Charley Patton, Lightnin&amp;#039; Hopkins, Blind Willie McTell and Sara Martin; &quot;every sensible woman got a back-door man,&quot; Martin wrote in &quot;Strange Loving Blues&quot; (1925). Robert Plant references the Dixon song in Led Zeppelin&amp;#039;s &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; (1969): &quot;Shake for me girl, I want to be your back-door man.&quot; The phrase &quot;back-door man&quot; dates from the 1920s, but the term became a double entendre in the 1960s, also meaning &quot;one who practices anal intercourse.&quot;\n\nThe song became an early standard cover song of The Doors, along with Dixon&amp;#039;s songs &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot; and &quot;Close to You&quot;. The &quot;door&quot; of the song, like the name of the band, suggests a Blakean symbol of perception, with an awareness of the 1960s Queer-culture double entendre giving the expression an additional layer of meaning. The Doors&amp;#039; drummer John Densmore described the song as &quot;deeply sexual and got everyone moving.&quot; The song also appears on The Doors&amp;#039; live album Absolutely Live (1970).\n\nTHE END\n\nThere are few Doors songs that can lay claim to the same level of both musical and cultural significance as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe EndÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Although the lengthy and conscious-shattering track rounds out the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s eponymous debut, itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ concert life actually pre-dates the long player. Legend has it that early performances -- particularly during the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOedipus sectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ -- were not only greeted with stunned silence, but ended up costing the band one of their first live gigs.\n\nLead vocalist and lyricist Jim MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poetic brilliance rarely, if ever, surpassed this slow, languid and scarily psychedelic tale that simultaneously draws on aspects of both love and hate. The narrative proved to be far more complex than most concurrent pop/rock at the time. As such, it requires the listener to ultimately surrender to the complexity of the multiple layers woven into the story line. In keeping with MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrical capacity for ambiguity, an analysis often begs more questions than it ultimately answers.\n\nThe tale of incestuous lust and murder comes full-circle and is framed by the ultimate finality in MorrisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s statement that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is the end.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAlthough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe EndÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was often included as part of the Doors early live sets, it became a real rarity in the wake of the litigious situations that Morrison found himself mired in during 1969. One of the last concert performances is available on the posthumously issued live Doors In Detroit (2000) CD set.\n\nArguably the most notable cover version is by Nico, as the title track from her 1974 release. Although it might seem impossible, she turns the song into an even more torrid and wrenching musical maze of madness. Her version is often dismissed by Doors fans as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unlistenableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, however her rendering on the seminal June 1, 1974 LP is perhaps more what Morrison actually intended.\n\nAnother notable use of this song was by Francis Ford Coppola during the commencing sequence of his Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). The marriage of sound and image has rarely been as cinematically memorable. To quote Marlon Brando -- ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe horror ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ the horrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nfrom wikipedia:\n\nRobby Krieger&amp;#039;s slinky, haunting guitar lines over D drone in DADGAD tuning using a harmonic minor scale recall Indian drone and raga-based music, as has often been noted, and the rolling and dramatic crescendoes of John Densmore&amp;#039;s drums recall Indian tabla rhythms. The music as a whole, though, does not sound entirely or even particularly &quot;Indian&quot;. The sharp, ringing edge of the guitar recalls the 50s rock and roll style, while the fingerpicking attack may derive equally from the flamenco guitar style Krieger had studied as a youth and from folk music. Ray Manzarek&amp;#039;s organ is used sparingly to provide an inconspicuous bass line (I-V-I-V-I-V...) and fills. One may find a strong similarity to Chopin&amp;#039;s &quot;Funeral March&quot; theme and also to Sandy Bull&amp;#039;s guitar instrumental &quot;Blend&quot; - but this may be more to do with the quality of the melodic minor scale than with any specific influence.\n\nStructurally, the song rises to three separate mini-crescendoes separated by slower sections of half-spoken, half-sung lyrics before building to an enormous psychedelic crescendo right after Jim Morrison sings the &quot;meet me at the back of the blue bus&quot; verse. Previously, the song had been weaving along on its melodies to an encounter with the ruling powers of the mind, the controlling &quot;father&quot; structure and the longed-for &quot;mother&quot;, or freedom.\n\nThe final crescendo represents either an attempt to break through to that freedom, or more likely, an Oedipal sexual climax. The sexual representation seems more likely given the similar crescendo apex very much along the lines of Ravel&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Bolero&quot;. Afterward, &quot;The End&quot; departs on a wistful note when Morrison sings, &quot;It hurts to set you free, but you&amp;#039;ll never follow me. The end of laughter and soft lies, the end of nights we tried to die.&quot; In the context of Morrison&amp;#039;s first interpretation quoted above, this lyric and the associated music that softly reiterates themes from the opening may mean that the comfort of childhood will be sacrificed for freedom.[\n\nShortly past the mid-point of the nearly 12-minute long album version, the song suddenly enters a spoken-word section with the words, &quot;The killer awoke before dawn... &quot; That section of the song reaches a dramatic climax with the lines, &quot;Father/ Yes son?/ I want to kill you/ Mother, I want to... (fuck you),&quot; (with the last two words screamed out unintelligibly). This is often considered a reference to Sophocles&amp;#039; Oedipus the King, a production of which Jim Morrison had worked on while at Florida State University.\n\nSaid Morrison in 1969, &quot;Everytime I hear that song, it means something else to me. It started out as a simple good-bye song probably just to a girl, but I see how it could be a goodbye to a kind of childhood. I really don&amp;#039;t know. I think it&amp;#039;s sufficiently complex and universal in its imagery that it could be almost anything you want it to be.&quot; Producer Paul Rothchild said in an interview that he believed the song to be an inside trip, and that &quot;kill the father&quot; means destroying everything hierarchical, controlling, and restrictive in one&amp;#039;s psyche, while &quot;fuck the mother&quot; means embracing everything that is expansive, flowing, and alive in the psyche. Ray Manzarek, the former keyboard player for the Doors spoke about it defensively saying,\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ He was giving voice in a rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll setting to the Oedipus complex, at the time a widely discussed tendency in Freudian psychology. He wasn&amp;#039;t saying he wanted to do that to his own mom and dad. He was re-enacting a bit of Greek drama. It was theatre! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Morrison may have been influenced by the Jungian concepts of individuation and archetypes, and was certainly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche&amp;#039;s concept of going beyond the limited types of human beings that hitherto existed by loving Dionysian vitality and life (&quot;the mother&quot;) while rejecting Apollonian systems and traditions (&quot;the father&quot;).\n\nThe lyrical reference to &quot;the Blue Bus&quot; has been variously conjectured to refer to either Indian mystic Meher Baba&amp;#039;s &quot;Blue Bus&quot; tours of the 1930s or to Santa Monica&amp;#039;s &quot;Big Blue Bus&quot; public bus lines. The link to Meher Baba seems unlikely given the dark and nihilistic tone of the song, with its references to insanity, patricide and incest, concepts alien to the life and outlook of Meher Baba. A reference to a bus line is a somewhat better possibility, but probably the most likely conjecture is that Morrison was referring to the drug numorphan (oxymorphone), an opioid substitute for morphine, which in the drug culture at the time was often referred to as &quot;The Blue Bus&quot; (it was available in blue 10mg instant-release tabs). Because of its highly euphoric effect Numorphan was very popular with the drug using community before it was withdrawn from the market in the 1970&amp;#039;s. Given Morrison&amp;#039;s well-known affinity for drug and alcohol use, and the overall &quot;otherworldly&quot; tenor of the song, this seems a more likely probability. The inspiring image would be that of being together with one&amp;#039;s lover in the altered, dreamy state of consciousness induced after taking the powerful opiate-like drug. Similarly, the line &quot;the blue bus is calling us&quot; likely refers to the addictive attraction of oxymorphone that develops in abusers of the drug, and &quot;driver where you takin&amp;#039; us&quot; would refer, again, to the dreamy, exploratory, unpredictable state of altered consciousness experienced while under the influence of the drug.\n\nAnother explanation for &quot;the Blue Bus&quot; phrase would be as a reference to the blue buses that, in the United States, military inductees boarded for transport to basic training during the era of the Vietnam War, when the song was written. Morrison may have intended it to be an anti-Vietnam anthem. Morrison&amp;#039;s father was an admiral in the U.S. Navy and as a &quot;navy brat&quot;, he was familiar with military life; no doubt he saw many &quot;blue buses&quot; in his youth.a[ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âº]\n\nThe following are phrases from &quot;The End&quot; that may help put the phrase &quot;the Blue Bus&quot; in context. The phrase &quot;The west is the best, The west is the best, Get here, and we&amp;#039;ll do the rest&quot; could summon images of troops preparing for transport to Vietnam to fight in the proxy &quot;West vs. Communist&quot; cold war. Other phrases that could be seen as military allusions include &quot;Lost in a Roman...wilderness of pain&quot; and &quot;The killer awoke before dawn, he put his boots on; He took a face from the ancient gallery.&quot; This may be the image of a soldier dressing to do battle in modern times, with an allusion toward a Roman infantryman. The phrase could also be an image of a Greek actor putting on a mask to perform in a play, except prior language implies a Roman allusion rather than one of an ancient Greek. Much of the brutal context of the song, implying random acts of killing, may make more sense in the context of war rather than in a drug trip gone bad, or the carefully prescribed plot of a Greek tragedy (cf. Oedipus). Further, the song begins and ends similarly: &quot;This is the end, Beautiful friend; This is the end, My only friend; The end of our elaborate plans; the end of everything that stands; The end; No safety or surprise; The end; I&amp;#039;ll never look into your eyes... again.&quot;\n\n&quot;The End&quot; was most famously used as a framing device for Francis Ford Coppola&amp;#039;s 1979 film Apocalypse Now, in which its dark, poetic passage marked the film&amp;#039;s descent into the surreal. The sound of helicopter rotors from the beginning of the film are often included in recordings of the song.\n\nHowever, this version of the song is also incomplete, and the sounds of a jungle replace most of the lyrics in the second half of the song.\n\nThis usage has led to other, often satirical usages for the song&amp;#039;s appearance:\n\n* Three sequences on The Simpsons television series in which the song plays while Homer contemplates suicide and another, &quot;Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore&quot;, in which, in an Apocalypse Now parody, he thinks he is a god, Smoke on the Daughter, When Bart raises his head out of the pile of leg warmers in the smoke outside, the song&amp;#039;s instrumental portion is heard, mirroring a sequence in the film Apocalypse Now.\n* A Saturday Night Live sketch in which John McCain is driven to madness while campaigning for George W. Bush as a parody of Apocalypse Now.\n* It was used in the final episode of The Dennis Miller Show, during another Apocalypse Now parody sequence, in which Dennis was airlifted by (we are led to believe) a helicopter out of the set.\n* The song was also referenced in a 2006 episode of The Venture Bros. entitled &quot;Assassinanny 911&quot;, in a scene which also parodied the Apocalypse Now usage, when Hank (under the influence of poison) quotes the Oedipal section of the song and tries to kill his father with a paper machete sword while a Doors-influenced score plays in the background.\n* The song was parodied in an episode of Animaniacs, the plot of which was partly a parody of Apocalypse Now. At the start of the episode, a voice actor sings in a Morrison-like voice, &quot;This is the beginning... the beginning of our story...the beginning...&quot;. At the middle of the story, the word &quot;beginning&quot; is replaced with the word &quot;middle&quot;. At the end of the episode he says &quot;This is the ending...the ending of our story...the ending...the ending...the ending...the ending.&quot; and a Jim Morrison character is seen being run over by a golf cart.\n* Director Martin Scorsese once used the song in a sex scene montage in his early student film Who&amp;#039;s That Knocking at My Door (1968).\n* The song was also used in Oliver Stone&amp;#039;s 1991 film The Doors, where it plays while the band explored drugs in the desert.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInfo taken from allmusicguide and wikipedia\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e53949715c4e9f19878e6c0075994c545ca03b","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+The+Doors+%28Perception+Box+DVD%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e53949715c4e9f19878e6c0075994c545ca03b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,229,57,73,113,92,78,159,25,135,142,108,0,117,153,76,84,92,160,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
