It has one box for everything: Type in the address bar and get suggestions for both search and web pages. Will give you thumbnails of your top sites; Access your favorite pages instantly with lightning speed from any new tab. Google Chrome is an open source web browser developed by Google. Its software architecture was engineered from scratch (using components from other open source software including WebKit and Mozilla Firefox) to cater for the changing needs of users and acknowledging that today most web sites aren't web pages but web applications. Design goals include stability, speed, security and a clean, simple and efficient user interface.\n\nSecurity\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Sandboxing\nEvery tab in Chrome is sandboxed, so that a tab can display contents of a web page and accept user input, but it will not be able to read the user's desktop or personal files. Google say they have &quot;taken the existing process boundary- and made it into a jail&quot;. There is an exception to this rule; browser plugins such as Adobe Flash Player do not run within the boundaries of the tab jail, and so users will still be vulnerable to cross-browser exploits based on plugins, until plugins have been updated to work with the new Chrome security. Google has also developed a new phishing blacklist, which will be built into Chrome, as well as made available via a separate public API.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Privacy\nGoogle announces a so-called incognito mode claiming that it &quot;lets you browse the web in complete privacy because it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t record any of your activity&quot;. No features of this, and no implications of the default mode with respect to Google's database are given.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Speed\nSpeed improvements are a primary design goal.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo know , learn and get all things come and join here\nLOTS AND LOTS OF GREAT THINGS ARE HERE\n                                                                                                           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents                                                                                                                                                                                                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor my 1550+ Torrents                                                                                                                                                                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\t\t\t\ncredit to the original creator encoder \t\t\t\n\n\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8eae5b769f728210d6ab5535cfbb629eb9a6ef2","amp;dn":"Google+Chrome+v17.0.963.83+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8eae5b769f728210d6ab5535cfbb629eb9a6ef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,234,229,183,105,247,40,33,13,106,181,83,92,251,182,41,235,154,110,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
