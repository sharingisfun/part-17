Speedwagon) is an American rock band. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Hi Infidelity (1980) contained four US Top 40 hits and is the group's best-selling album, with over ten million copies sold.\n\nOver the course of its career, the band has sold more than 40 million records and has charted thirteen Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can't Fight This Feeling&quot;. REO Speedwagon's mainstream popularity dissipated in the 1990s but the band remains a popular live act.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLife as We Know It is the twelfth studio album by REO Speedwagon, released in 1987 (see 1987 in music). It features &quot;That Ain't Love&quot; and &quot;In My Dreams&quot;, both of which were Top 20 hits; &quot;Variety Tonight&quot;, which reached #60 on the Hot 100; and &quot;One Too Many Girlfriends&quot;, which showcased the ongoing friction between band members Kevin Cronin and Gary Richrath.
