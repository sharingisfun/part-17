Their third album Miss You in the Days is the Brighton chamber pop outfitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ghost story collection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ its sleeve a gathering of amorphous spectres in snow thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll no doubt be trotted out one day as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœproof of paranormal activityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on Most Haunted; its sounds the fragile broodings of piano, viola and violin echoing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ literally Ã¢â‚¬â€œ around a haunted pub attic in the grounds of Blickling Hall where the album was recorded within earshot of the headless ghost of Anne Boleyn. Its themes: the inhuman and incorporeal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ poltergeists, possessions, apparitions and other such banes of the weak-minded and gullible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rendered in wonderfully human fashion. Like Beirut hosting a Wuthering Heights theme Halloween party, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a record that grows goose-bumps in the night.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Laid Up In Lavender  (03:20), 7.84 MB\n02.
