From this point on reality becomes distorted and he begins to have weird sensations and halucinations.\nMot noteable is the visit from a young teenage girl which later visions show was brutally raped and murdered. So now Tom finds himself with a mystery to solve for a desparate ghost who becomes more and impatient as time goes by.\nMuch like &quot;The sixth sense&quot; and every bit as creepy. Yes you will feel the prickly things on the back of your spine.\nOne advantage this film has over Sixth Sense is that it does not rely nearly so heavily on your not knowing the outcome in order to enjoy it. Which makes this film more re-watchable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2982edc9ba54e9d0cfc96af39105149de0022a1","amp;dn":"Stir+Of+Echoes+1999+Dvdrip+Xvid.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2982edc9ba54e9d0cfc96af39105149de0022a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,152,46,220,155,165,78,157,12,252,150,175,57,16,81,73,222,0,34,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
