This instrumental piece (a antonym for rose-coloured spectacles), originally was availabe only on the long play cassette release. It is the soundtrack of Carnage Visors, a short film by Ric Gallup, Simons brother. It was screened at the beginning of shows in place of a support band on the 1981 Picture Tour, and featured animation of several dolls in different positions and stances. The film has since disappeared and only Lol Tolhurst, Robert Smith, and Simon Gallup own copies of it, though during a televised interview in the mid-1980s the host of the program surprised the band by playing a clip of the film on set.\n\nNot my rip but verified .FLAC with Audiochecker V1.2.
