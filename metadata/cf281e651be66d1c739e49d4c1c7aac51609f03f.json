They later recorded their eponymous debut in 1972, soon to be followed by Darwin!, and in 1973 Io sono nato libero. Right from the start the most striking features of their sound was the complex texture provided by the piano, Hammond organ and synthesizers played by the Nocenzi brothers, plus the original vocals delivered by Francesco Di Giacomo. A careful balance of electronic and acoustic instruments, plus the use of reeds (played by some of the members of the band, in addition to their usual instrument), made the sound of Banco increasingly original and innovative, with a blend of rock, jazz and classical music which did not however forsake the Italian melodic tradition.\n\nProving popular in Italy and becoming known abroad, the band signed with Manticore Records together with the Premiata Forneria Marconi. In 1975 Banco was released, a collection of translated songs together with new material, targeting the international market. Come in un'ultima cena was also translated as As in a Last Supper.\n\nThe late 1970s saw Banco del Mutuo Soccorso going in new directions, with a film soundtrack in 1976's Garofano rosso and recordings with an orchestra in 1978's ...di terra. They changed their name to the simplified Banco.\n\nThe 1980s saw Banco's musical direction change towards lighter pop and shorter songs, producing some hits. This is due to the limited success they had abroad with their albums with English lyrics (also due to the shutdown of Manticore in 1977), which led to the decision to exploit Di Giacomo's remarkable vocal gifts with more marketable songs. Gianni Nocenzi left the band for a solo career. Other members came and went.\n\nIn the 1990s and now back to using the longer name, they started playing their 1970s material again. They performed unplugged versions of their songs live and re-recorded their first albums. New material was also produced.\n\nToday, the band continues to play live, although no new material has been recorded since 1997.\n\nOn February 21, 2014, Francesco di Giacomo died in a car accident at the age of 67.[\n\nProgarchives:\nBanco Del Mutuo Soccorso biography\n\n\nOne of the most important progressive rock bands to come from Italy, BANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO, along with LE ORME and PFM are regarded as the big three of the RPI genre. This is not only because of their longevity and the level of success they achieved in their own country, but also because each were able to make considerable inroads abroad, something which didn't happen for most of their contemporaries.\n\nDespite not releasing their first album until 1972, the band actually formed in 1969, their sound centering around the virtuoso dual keyboard work of the Nocenzi brothers, Gianni and Vittorio. The early line-up fluctuated with various members coming and going before any recorded output was released, including drummers Franco Pontecorvi and Mario Achilli, bassist Fabrizio Falco and guitarists Gianfranco Coletta (ex CHETRO &amp; CO) and Claudio Falco. This early incarnation of the band did, however, record some material but this wouldn't surface until 1989 (see the &quot;Donna Plautilla&quot; album). \n\nJoining the Nocenzi brothers for a more stable line-up in time for their first album was ex-FIORI DI CAMPO guitarist Marcello Todaro and three members of LE ESPERIENZE, vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo, drummer Pier Luigi Calderoni and bassist Renato D'Angelo. Their eponymous first album was a remarkably mature piece of inventive symphonic progressive rock with classical influences, featuring excellent musicianship and the emotionally charged vocal delivery of Di Giacomo. This was quickly followed up by the equally highly regarded &quot;Darwin&quot; and &quot;Io Sono Nato Libero,&quot; forming a trio of albums that are essential listening for anyone with even the most casual interest in the RPI genre. \n\nA change of guitarist followed shortly after the recording of &quot;Io Sono Nato Libero,&quot; when Todaro left and joined CRYSTALS and was replaced by Rodolfo Maltese, formerly of HOMO SAPIENS. Around this time the band attempted to make inroads outside their native Italy and released the English sung &quot;Banco&quot; on ELP'S Manticore label. In reality this was largely a compilation, as it consisted of re-recorded songs from their first three albums with the exception of one track. To promote this they toured the USA and UK with limited success. &quot;Banco&quot; was followed in 1976 by the film soundtrack album &quot;Garofano Rosso,&quot; and in the same year two versions of the same album, one Italian and one English, &quot;Come In Un'Ultima Cena&quot; and &quot;As In A Last Supper&quot; were released. 1978 saw the release of another all instrumental album &quot;.Di Terra&quot;, this time incorporating the use of an orchestra.\n\n&quot;Canto Di Primavera&quot; saw bassist D'Angelo being replaced by Gianni Colaiacomo, and after this the band entered a period that is probably of little interest to prog fans, moving in a more commercial pop direction. In 1983 Gianni Nocenzi was to leave the band, and the following years saw the coming and going of a number of musicians through a series of critically slated albums, at least amongst the prog community. \n\nSigns that the band may be returning to their prog roots came in 1991 when the band re-recorded their acclaimed first album and &quot;Darwin&quot;. The lightweight pop/rock of &quot;Banco 13&quot;, released in 1994 showed however that it was a little early to celebrate. No studio albums have appeared since 1996 but the band continued with sporadic live activity and released a number of live albums. Perhaps the most interesting of these is &quot;Seguendo Le Tracce&quot;, which captures a stunning concert from 1975, reminding us how great this band can be. The current line-up is now comprised of vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo, on keyboards Vittorio Nocenzi, guitarists Rodolfo Maltese and Filippo Marcheggiani, drummer Maurizio Masi, bassist Tiziano Ricci and on sax, flute and clarinet Alessandro Papotto (ex-PFM).\n\nBANCO DEL MUTUO SOCCORSO, particularly the first three albums, is an essential early port of call for anyone looking to discover the RPI genre.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf281e651be66d1c739e49d4c1c7aac51609f03f","amp;dn":"Banco+del+Mutuo+Soccorso+collectiion+incl.+24%2F96+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf281e651be66d1c739e49d4c1c7aac51609f03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,40,30,101,27,230,109,28,115,158,73,212,193,199,170,197,22,9,240,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
