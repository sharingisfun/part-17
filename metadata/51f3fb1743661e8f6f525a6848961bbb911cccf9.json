It was produced by Vancouver-based production company Mainframe Entertainment, and created by Gavin Blair, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell and John Grace, with the visuals designed by Brendan McCarthy after an initial attempt by Ian Gibson.\n\nIt is the first full-length, completely computer-animated TV series.\n\nThe setting is in the inner world of a computer system known by its inhabitants as Mainframe. It was deliberately chosen due to technological constraints at the time, as the fictional computer world allowed for blocky looking models and mechanical animation.[1] Mainframe is divided into six sectors (moving clockwise): Baudway, Kits, Floating Point Park, Beverly Hills, Wall Street, and Ghetty Prime. The names of Mainframe's sectors are homages to famous neighbourhoods, mostly in New York City or Los Angeles. However, the Kits sector is named for Kitsilano, a neighbourhood in Vancouver, Mainframe Entertainment's home city. Also, Ghetty Prime is a reference to Frank Herbert's Dune, as Giedi Prime is the home world of House Harkonnen, the villainous family in the first book of the series. Mainframe is populated almost entirely by binomes, little creatures that represent either 1s or 0s, as well as a handful of Sprites who are primarily humanoid creatures of more complex design and are the main characters of the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51f3fb1743661e8f6f525a6848961bbb911cccf9","amp;dn":"Reboot+All+4+Seasons+HQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51f3fb1743661e8f6f525a6848961bbb911cccf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,243,251,23,67,102,30,143,111,82,90,104,72,150,27,187,145,28,204,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
