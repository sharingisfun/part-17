It consists of Betrayal who is responsible for bass, programming and keyboards and Void who looks after lyrics, guitars and vocals. They are said to create goth rock music with the elements of death rock, electronics and industrial. \n\nDuring the last 6 years have created their own, intriguing mixture of sounds taking their inspiration from goth-rock\nof The Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, The Cure and Fields of the Nephilim, deathrock of Christian Death, electro sound of Clan of Xymox as well as murderous sound of a drum machine (a nod towards industrial group Laibach).The combination works well with a polished, dark image the band presents on stage.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:601c63e3bf46b25b3a47001ce20bb00d0493d689","amp;dn":"Deathcamp+Project+-+Well-Known+Pleasures+%282008%29+%5Bmp3%40VBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"601c63e3bf46b25b3a47001ce20bb00d0493d689","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,28,99,227,191,70,178,91,58,71,0,28,226,11,176,13,4,147,214,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
