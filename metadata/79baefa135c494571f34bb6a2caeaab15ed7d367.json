In six standardized levels, it describes the skills a learner has at each step along the way.\n\nLevel A1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Getting started\nLearn how to communicate the basics, like where you live and what your hobbies are.\n\nLevel A2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Communicating basic information\nYou can talk about basic topics and express your needs - like when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re shopping.\n\nLevel B1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Manage everyday situations\nWhen traveling in Germany, you can easily deal with most situations you encounter. You can talk about your experiences and clearly state your point of view.\n\nLevel B2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Be convincing\nYou can communicate spontaneously and fluently - even in longer conversations with native speakers. You can follow complicated texts and discussions and express your opinion on abstract topics.\n\nLevel C1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Communicate freely\nYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to search for words and you can speak German comfortably and flexibly in any situation.
