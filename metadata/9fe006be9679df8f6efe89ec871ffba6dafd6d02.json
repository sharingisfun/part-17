It seems to be a locked room mystery: the baby was alone, the door locked and no one was there except for a life-sized doll of Mr. Punch whose fingermarks appear on the babyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body. As Bryant &amp; May and their colleagues try to unravel this strange case, the body count rises and each murder resonates with scenes from the Punch and Judy show. No one is what they seem and everyone is hiding something.\n\nArthur Bryant is also finally writing his memoirs and mousey Anna Marquand is the lucky person who gets to transcribe BryantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memories. Except she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all that lucky because sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soon found dead from what looks like an unfortunate accident soon after she gives Bryant an edited draft of his memoirs and is mugged on her doorstep","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fe006be9679df8f6efe89ec871ffba6dafd6d02","amp;dn":"Christopher+Fowler-The+Memory+Of+Blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fe006be9679df8f6efe89ec871ffba6dafd6d02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,224,6,190,150,121,223,143,110,254,137,236,135,31,251,166,218,253,109,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
