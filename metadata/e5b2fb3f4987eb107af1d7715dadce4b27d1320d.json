Nobel winner . . . bestselling author . . . safe-cracker.\n\nIn this substantial graphic novel biography, First Second presents the larger-than-life exploits of Nobel-winning quantum physicist, adventurer, musician, world-class raconteur, and one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century: Richard Feynman. Written by nonfiction comics mainstay Jim Ottaviani and brilliantly illustrated by First Second author Leland Myrick, Feynman tells the story of the great manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life from his childhood in Long Island to his work on the Manhattan Project and the Challenger disaster. Ottaviani tackles the bad with the good, leaving the reader delighted by FeynmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exuberant life and staggered at the loss humanity suffered with his death.\n\nAnyone who ever wanted to know more about Richard P. Feynman, quantum electrodynamics, the fine art of the bongo drums, the outrageously obscure nation of Tuva, or the development and popularization of the field of physics in the United States need look no further than this rich and joyful work.\n\n\nFor anyone who cares, here's my release thread, I'll be posting all of my torrents there:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b2fb3f4987eb107af1d7715dadce4b27d1320d","amp;dn":"Feynman+%282011%29+%28Jojo%29+%5BBy+Jim+Ottaviani%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b2fb3f4987eb107af1d7715dadce4b27d1320d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,178,251,63,73,135,235,16,122,241,215,113,93,173,206,75,39,209,50,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
