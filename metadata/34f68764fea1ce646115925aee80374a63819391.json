The album was first released in 2003 under the band name Metal Shop then subsequently reissued in 2005 under the band name Metal Skool, upon which the final track was replaced. The original version closes with a self-referential eponymous 'theme' song for the band but due to the change in band name the track was replaced by a cover of Ian Hunter's 'Cleveland Rocks' thematically retitled 'Cleveland Roxx'. Three of the tracks are spoken-word comedy skits that act as song introductions. The cover of the album shows clear resemblance to the cover of Look What the Cat Dragged In by Poison.\nHell's on Fire, Fat Girl (Thar She Blows) and Stripper Girl were all Updated, and Re-recorded for their 2009 follow-up album, Feel the Steel. A music video was released for Fat Girl (Thar She Blows) and released on DVD in 2005.\n\nThe Band:\n\nMichael Starr - Vocals\nSatchel - Guitar/vocals\nLexxi Foxxx - Bass/vocals\nStix Zadinia - drums/vocals\n\nSet List:\n\n01 Satan's Intro\n02 Big Boobs\n03 Is It Hot in Here (spoken word skit)\n04 Hell's on Fire\n05 Fat Girl (Thar She Blows)\n06 Michael Falls in Love (spoken word skit)\n07 Stripper Girl\n08 Ginger Pusses Out (&quot;Lexxi Pusses Out&quot; on the reissue) (spoken word skit)\n09 Cleveland Roxx (2005 Replacement Track)\n10 Metal Shop (2003 Original Track)\n\n*** Drops right into iTunes so have fun! ***\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\t\t\n\nKeep these torrents alive!
