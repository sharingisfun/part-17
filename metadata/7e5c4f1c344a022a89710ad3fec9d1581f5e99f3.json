Which should be good \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIt would sure be nice if the bay would let me update the torrent but whateves...\n\nohhhh wait I totally had something for this .....something about stripes and Solids\n\ncheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5c4f1c344a022a89710ad3fec9d1581f5e99f3","amp;dn":"Archer+Season+2+--In+Progress+%281-13%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5c4f1c344a022a89710ad3fec9d1581f5e99f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,92,79,28,52,74,2,42,137,113,10,211,254,201,209,88,31,94,153,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
