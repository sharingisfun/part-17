It's a bird! It's a plane! It's...a copyright attorney that represents DC Comics handing out cease &amp; desist letters to the producers of Supersonic Man!\n\nSadly, Supersonic Man, though he tries his hardest, still does his best to crib from various, more well-known sources. He has the Man of Steel's strength, Dr. Manhattan's occasional be-speedoed-ness, and yes, the awkward, moron-like flying of The Pumaman. What original attributes does he bring to the table, you may ask? Well, he uses his amazing supersonic powers to shatter the speed of sound and...turn a gun into a banana.\n\nAnd he'll need every banana he can get his hands on because a nefarious bad guy played by Cameron Mitchell (Death of a Salesman, Frankenstein Island, Space Mutiny) has an evil island lair where he intends to start slow, really focus his energies, and take over one very specific three block area in the city of Richmond, VirÃ¢â‚¬â€we're just kidding of course, he intends to take over the entire world. Fortunately, he has an ace up his sleeves: possession of the world's lamest robot, which despite its slow movements and general clumsiness, can still shoot gigantic flames that appear to measure approximately a few degrees less than the core of the sun itself.\n\nCan Supersonic Man outwit this foe and save humanity? Assume a rigid, very uncomfortable looking flying stance and join Mike, Kevin, and Bill to find out!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbb38c2f7269f0fb91553580d9437dc898c51a33","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+-+Supersonic+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbb38c2f7269f0fb91553580d9437dc898c51a33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,179,140,47,114,105,240,251,145,85,53,128,217,67,125,200,152,197,26,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
