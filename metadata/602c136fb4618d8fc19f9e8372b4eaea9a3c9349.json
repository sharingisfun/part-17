Added to the original album are two alternate takes. \n\nGrant Green: Guitar\nBen Tucker: Bass\nDave Bailey: Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:602c136fb4618d8fc19f9e8372b4eaea9a3c9349","amp;dn":"GRANT+GREEN+-+1961+-+Green+Street%5Bflac%5D%5Bnadojazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"602c136fb4618d8fc19f9e8372b4eaea9a3c9349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,44,19,111,180,97,141,143,193,159,158,131,114,180,234,234,154,60,147,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
