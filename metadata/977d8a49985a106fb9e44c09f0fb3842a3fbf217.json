Dizzy's introduction is fun and the music is very well performed and recorded.  &quot;Desafinado&quot; is excellent but &quot;Long Long Summer&quot; composed by Lalo Schifrin is my favorite track on the album.  Lalo's Piano lick is so soulful that it could be ripe for a sample.  The final track &quot;Kush&quot; is a wild journey at over Nine Minutes.  It has some fantastically funky Drumming by Chuck Lampkin and as Lalo starts his brilliant Piano Solo, the Bass played by Bob Cunningham and Drums are so tight it hurts.\n\nHere are the Uncredited Rear Album Cover Notes in entirety.\nA Musical Safari most accurately describes what evolved from this afternoon concert in september, 1961 at Monterey Jazz Festival.  Dizzy's always felt close to his African roots; be it in the Afro-Cuban sound that is rightfully called the Father of or the gentle hypnotic beat of Bossa-nova.  Dizzy's music is always sanctified with a quality that appeals to all.  This recording captures a truly historic moment in modern music.\n\nPersonnel:\nAlto &amp; Flute  - Leo Wright\nDrums  - Chuck Lampkin\nBass  - Bob Cunningham\nVocal  - Joe Carroll &amp; Dizzy Gillespie\n\nDizzy Gillespie - A Musical Safari Tracks:\n00  Duke's Intro &amp; Dizzy's Rap\n01  Desafinado\n02  Lorraine\n03  Long Long Summer\n04  OO Pop A Dah\n05  Pau De Arara\n06  Kush","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:977d8a49985a106fb9e44c09f0fb3842a3fbf217","amp;dn":"Dizzy+Gillespie+-+A+Musical+Safari+%281961%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"977d8a49985a106fb9e44c09f0fb3842a3fbf217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,125,138,73,152,90,16,111,185,228,76,9,240,251,56,66,163,251,242,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
