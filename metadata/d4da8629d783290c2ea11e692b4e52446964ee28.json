Until something happened. Something that even after 80 years, can never be forgotten or forgiven . . . .Eleven-year-old twins Hannah and Anna agree about everythingÃ¢â‚¬â€especially that they don't want to move to the creepy old house on Hemlock Road. But as soon as they move into the house, the twins start disagreeing for the first time in their lives. In fact, it's almost as though something or someone is trying to drive them apart. While Anna settles in, Hannah can't ignore the strange things that keep happening on Hemlock Road. Why does she sense things that no one else in the family does? Like when the hemlock branch outside waves shush, shush. Or at night, if she listens hard enough, it's almost as though someone is trying to talk to her. Someone no one else can hear. Someone angry enough to want revenge. Hannah, are you listening? Is the house haunted? Is Hannah crazy? Or does something in the house want her as a best friendÃ¢â‚¬â€forever?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4da8629d783290c2ea11e692b4e52446964ee28","amp;dn":"The+Girl+Behind+The+Glass+-+Jane+Kelley.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4da8629d783290c2ea11e692b4e52446964ee28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,218,134,41,215,131,41,12,46,161,30,105,43,78,82,68,105,100,238,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
