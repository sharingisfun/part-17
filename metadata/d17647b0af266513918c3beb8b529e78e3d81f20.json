Several years later, she has finally managed to blend in, but her hard-won peace is threatened by the arrival of a bumbling team of paranormal investigators. Mia is drawn in reluctantly as an advisor on what, at first, seems to be a fairly straightforward case, only to discover that the Hollow has much more in store for her. An ancient evil is rising in Cold Creek Hollow. What begins as a ghost hunt will become a fight for survival.\n\n2)Ghostly Attachments \nIt isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the chair rocking by itself that sends the young family fleeing in the middle of the night. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when it stops rocking and all hell breaks loose. This family needs help. Enter PEEPs (Paranormal Entity Exposure Partners) armed with the latest hi-tech gear and the ghost communication abilities of Mia Cooper. But this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a normal case. Some of the ghosts arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t playing fair. Some of them are armed. MiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention is divided between this case and her friend Sabine, who has gone missing during an out of body walkabout. Can she pull it all together in time to save Sabine from a narcissistic collector and help PEEPs to survive the destructive forces that have come to play via their ghostly attachments? \n\n3)Sand Trap\nNot all sand traps occur on the links. Some may be found on a popular beach or lonely stretch of highway. A sensitive and two ghost hunters walk into a bar. The barman is silent and the barflies long dead. Sounds like the start of a joke, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not. An active haunt in a derelict biker bar on Route 66 is a dream come true for the PEEPs team until it turns violent. An SOS is sent to Mia Cooper who hits the open road with her ghostly pal Murphy riding shotgun. Together they try to enter the haunted building only to be repelled by the building itself. They canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get in, and the ghosts can get out. Courtney Fairchild wanted a rich husband and wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to let a little thing like death stand in her way. Hit by lightning as she walked along an exclusive Floridian beach, her soul was fused together with the sand, creating a beautiful specimen of fulgurite, which finds a home at the Chicago Field Museum. Released into the museum, Courtney roams from display to display looking for a way out of her glass prison. Join Mia and the PEEPs team on an adventure from the cultural confines of ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Field Museum down Route 66 to LuckyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bar where evil is always on tap.                        \n\n4)Darker than Dark \n5)The Garden \n6)Puzzle \n7)Old Bones\n8) Things that Go Bump in the Night \n9) Something Old\n10) The Middle House: Return to Cold Creek Hollow \n11) Renovation \n12) Mind Fray\n\nNovellas: \n3.1) Eternal Maze  \n3.2) Homecoming \n9.1) Checking Out \n9.2) Ice and Steel \n\n\nNote:   I bought these..\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
