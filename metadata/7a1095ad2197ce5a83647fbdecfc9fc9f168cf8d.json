The 2 pilots on this program which runs more than 4 hours long! give you all the information you want about the aircraft, the route, oceanic crossings and much much more!\n\nThis is a wonderful occasion to follow a flight to the US as we fly into busy Newark International Airport. You will see some of the traffic as we taxi for takeoff including a go-around and more presentations by the pilots on the overnight return crossing to Stockholm.\n\nAlso included is a detailed cabin presentation by the flight attendants and a look at the superb inflight service of SAS!\n\n=============================\nEnjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a1095ad2197ce5a83647fbdecfc9fc9f168cf8d","amp;dn":"Just+Planes+%28World+Air+Routes%29+-+Scandinavian+Airlines+%28SAS%29+A33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a1095ad2197ce5a83647fbdecfc9fc9f168cf8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,16,149,173,33,151,206,90,131,100,127,189,236,252,159,201,241,104,207,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
