IF people really want to singalong ...\n\n\n\nAnd we also know statisticly that torrent-downloaders have great voices...,\n\nlove to reboot their computers just because they want to create temp-files..., \n\nare collectors of Kevin Federline CDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s ..., often live in buildings with thin \n\nwalls...,  and are in a constant lack of money... !\n\n\n\nHaving all these subtitles on KylieÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s musicvideos gives you now a great \n\nopportunity to raise your voice  ( with a little help from &quot;thin walls&quot; ),  \n\nand then start collecting a weekly paycheck from thankful neighbors, who \n\nreally gonna appreciate what they hear...    Who wouldnÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t...?\n\n\n\nIn VLC you can find the subtitles if you rightclick on the VLC-screen, \nand from the context-menu choose :  &quot;Video&quot; / etc ...\n\n\n\n/  Dutch95\n\n\n______________________________________\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b422203988d223bc027b00603301673f03f1f4af","amp;dn":"Kylie+Minogue++-++14+Music+Videos++-++Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b422203988d223bc027b00603301673f03f1f4af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,34,32,57,136,210,35,188,2,123,0,96,51,1,103,63,3,241,244,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
