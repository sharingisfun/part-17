It is also used in hospitals throughout Brazil.\n\nEmergency Triage is the core text for the MTS, which utilises a risk averse system of prioritisation for patients in all unscheduled care settings.  As such, it is an essential text for all emergency department staff using the MTS, in particular triage nurses. The book is both a training tool and a reference for daily use in the Emergency Department and prehospital settings. \n\nThis edition features revised protocols that reflect new approaches to prioritisation, with accompanying revised flowcharts -  the core part of the book.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nPresentation flow charts index\n\n1: Introduction\n\n2: The decision-making process and triage\n\n3: The triage method\n\n4: Pain assessment as part of the triage process\n\n5: Patient management, triage and the triage nurse\n\n6: Auditing the triage process\n\n7: Telephone triage\n\n8: Beyond prioritisation to other applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65d3791c2732e5c9af7875443984f1a09825acb","amp;dn":"Emergency+Triage%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65d3791c2732e5c9af7875443984f1a09825acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,93,55,145,194,115,46,92,154,247,135,84,67,152,79,26,9,130,90,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
