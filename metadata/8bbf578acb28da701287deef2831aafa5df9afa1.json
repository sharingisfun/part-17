Even more than happiness and optimism, love holds the key to improving our mental and physical health as well as lengthening our lives.\n\nUsing research from her own lab, Fredrickson redefines love not as a stable behemoth, but as micro-moments of connection between people - even strangers. She demonstrates that our capacity for experiencing love can be measured and strengthened in ways that improve our health and longevity. Finally, she introduces us to informal and formal practices to unlock love in our lives, generate compassion, and even self-soothe.\n\nRare in its scope and ambitious in its message, Love 2.0 will reinvent how you look at and experience our most powerful emotion.\n\nÃ‚Â©2013 Barbara Fredrickson Ph.D.; (P)2013 Gildan Media LLC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bbf578acb28da701287deef2831aafa5df9afa1","amp;dn":"Love+2.0%3A+How+Our+Supreme+Emotion+Affects+Everything+We+Feel%2C+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bbf578acb28da701287deef2831aafa5df9afa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,191,87,138,203,40,218,112,18,135,222,239,40,49,170,250,93,249,175,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
