Von Bruno secretly seeks revenge against the leaders of a British force that set the natives against him in colonial Africa: Burton's missing friends are among his victims, and Burton is now also in the trap. Burton plans to escape with von Bruno's abused Countess, but the Count's henchmen bar the way.\n\nBoris Karloff returns to his old Universal stamping grounds in the mild horror item Black Castle. The plot is motivated by a brace of 18th-century aristocrats, Beckett (Richard Greene) and Count Von Bruno (Stephen McNally). Invited to visit Von Bruno's castle in Austria, Beckett accepts, hoping in this way to prove that the count is responsible for the deaths of two of his friends. The sadistic Von Bruno toys with his guest, intending to subject Beckett to a horrible demise at the first opportunity. When Beckett meets the Count's reluctant bride Elga (Paula Corday), he vows to free her from the accursed castle. Karloff has a smallish role as the Count's humanitarian physician, while his fellow horror-star Lon Chaney Jr. does his usual as a mute but deadly manservant. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime  82 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 82 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8553724e4cf31af6101f56144d5083a14c0a1e","amp;dn":"The+Boris+Karloff+Collection+-+The+Black+Castle+%281952%29+Xvid+1cd+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8553724e4cf31af6101f56144d5083a14c0a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,133,83,114,78,76,243,26,246,16,31,86,20,77,80,131,161,76,10,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
