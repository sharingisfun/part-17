Having evolved from RundeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notes for an introductory topology course at the University of Alberta, this essential text provides a concise introduction to set-theoretic topology, as well as some algebraic topology. It is accessible to undergraduates from the second year on, and even beginning graduate students can benefit from some sections. The well-chosen selection of examples is accessible to students who have a background in calculus and elementary algebra, but not necessarily in real or complex analysis. In places, RundeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s text treats its material differently to other books on the subject, providing a fresh perspective.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25cb800898a0ba4a2d4d8cf2eb4c98c28af6ea1b","amp;dn":"A+Taste+of+Topology+-+Volker+Runde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25cb800898a0ba4a2d4d8cf2eb4c98c28af6ea1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,203,128,8,152,160,186,74,45,77,140,242,235,76,152,194,138,246,234,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
