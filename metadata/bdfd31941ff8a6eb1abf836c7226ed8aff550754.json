Crisp but grimey, the authority with which these pickers ply their craft is remarkable. The authentic, boozy and brawling vocals of Derrick Dunn are often augmented by the hillbilly harmonies that are yelped in a backwoods style call and response with the rest of the band. These 14 songs simply tear it up. Take notes, wannabees.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdfd31941ff8a6eb1abf836c7226ed8aff550754","amp;dn":".357+String+Band+-+Lighting+From+The+North+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdfd31941ff8a6eb1abf836c7226ed8aff550754","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,253,49,148,31,248,166,235,26,191,131,108,114,38,237,138,255,85,7,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
