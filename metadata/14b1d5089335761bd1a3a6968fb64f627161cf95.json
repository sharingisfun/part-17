The analysis is done in product-specific fashion, covering, among other subjects, risk characterization, calibration strategies, and valuation methods. In its second half, Volume III studies the general topic of derivative portfolio risk management, with a particular emphasis on the challenging problem of computing smooth price sensitivities to market input perturbations. \n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nVolume III.
