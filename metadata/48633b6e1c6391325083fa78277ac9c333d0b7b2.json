London, Washington, DC, New York, and Frankfurt will be destroyed, unless their demands are met--and their demands are impossible. After a city in the western United States is fire bombed--a practice run--Alex Cross knows that it is only a matter of time before the bombers threats to the other cities are brutally executed.\n\nHeading up the investigation by the FBI, CIA, and Interpol, Alex Cross is stunned when surveillance photos show Geoffrey Shafer, the Weasel, near one of the bombing sites. He senses the presence of the Wolf as well, the most vicious predator he has ever battled. With millions of lives in the balance, Cross has to see if the most powerful law enforcement agencies in the world can stay ahead of these two men's cunning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48633b6e1c6391325083fa78277ac9c333d0b7b2","amp;dn":"London+Bridges+-+James+Patterson-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48633b6e1c6391325083fa78277ac9c333d0b7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,99,59,110,28,99,145,50,80,131,250,120,39,122,201,195,51,208,183,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
