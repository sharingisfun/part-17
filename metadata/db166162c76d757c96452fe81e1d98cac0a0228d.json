Unfortunately, that server has been shut down due to the lack of money to keep paying the bills, and all the maps went to the digital heaven as their bits were recycled.\n\nToday I found one of my old backups where 3 collections of maps have survived over 7 years, hiding until times would become better. These 3 collections contain over 1000 (yes, that is one thousand) single player maps for settlers IV. Now I have the honor to set them free.\n\nThese maps were made publicly available for free by the authors; therefore it is legal to share them. Please do share them until your ratio is at least one, I have a slow connection, so uploading will take a while even when superseeding.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db166162c76d757c96452fe81e1d98cac0a0228d","amp;dn":"Settlers+4+maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db166162c76d757c96452fe81e1d98cac0a0228d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,22,97,98,199,109,117,124,150,69,47,232,30,29,152,202,192,160,34,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
