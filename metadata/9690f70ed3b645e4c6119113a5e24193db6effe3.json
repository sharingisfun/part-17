Promotional info for the first volume TPB - &quot;Ultimate victory has never been closer for the Voltron Force. King Zarkon's brutal regime has been pushed to the edges of the galaxy, left to wage a series of desperate and losing battles to claim innocent victims while they still can. But Zarkon knows something - a secret about Voltron over a hundred years old that could change everything for the Galaxy Alliance. This isn't the Voltron we all know, but one redefined and re-imagined by those he and his adventures have inspired over the years. This is Generation Voltron!&quot;\n\nThe majority of the scans are by theGroup, with one each by ZOOM!-Empire and Empire proper. All are digital editions.
