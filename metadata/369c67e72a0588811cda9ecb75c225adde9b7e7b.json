Staunchly anti-socialist, anti-union, and anti-Europe, she spoke long and often of returning Britain to strength and greatness. A divisive figure, often closely identified with Ronald Reagan, she broke the power of the unions and led the UK to victory in the Falklands War. Today, she is remembered with great nostalgia by the right, and is deeply scorned by the left. What is unquestioned, however, is the metamorphic effect she had on British politics; leading to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“New LeftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of Tony Blair, and ultimately to the recent election of David Cameron.\n\nContained herein are:\n\n1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Long Walk to FinchleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: A dramatization of her entry into politics leading up to her accession as Prime Minister.\n\n2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Making of the Iron LadyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A BBC documentary describing the same period.\n\n3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThatcher: The Downing Street YearsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A four-part BBC documentary on her period in office.\n\n3A ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Falklands PlayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A BBC radio drama enacting the interplay at #10 Downing Street during the Falklands War.
