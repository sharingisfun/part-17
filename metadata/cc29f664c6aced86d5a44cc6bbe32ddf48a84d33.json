The television series is a spin-off of a series of animated shorts originally aired on The Tracey Ullman Show. The series is a satirical parody of the Middle American lifestyle epitomized by its title family. It lampoons many aspects of the human condition, as well as American culture, society as a whole and even television itself. The Simpsons has also had a significant influence on post-Cold War popular culture. The show has also been cited as an influence on many adult-oriented animated series in the late 1990s, such as South Park, Futurama, and Family Guy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc29f664c6aced86d5a44cc6bbe32ddf48a84d33","amp;dn":"The.Simpsons.15x18.CZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc29f664c6aced86d5a44cc6bbe32ddf48a84d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,41,246,100,198,172,237,134,213,164,76,198,187,227,45,223,72,168,77,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
