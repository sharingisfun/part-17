His seduction (or redemption) by the world moves dramatically to confirm that phrase. Into the grays, browns and greens of Bergman&amp;#039;s newly mastered color palette, burst the reds that threatens to become the sign of any human relationship--the deeper, the more violence necessary to break through to the other person. With Persona, The Passion of Anna marks the high-point of Bergman&amp;#039;s achievement in the sixties. Liberated from any direct confrontation with theology, Bergman here translates his concerns into new terms. &amp;#039;Why don&amp;#039;t you do something you believe in?&amp;#039; Anna asks the architect, and Bergman&amp;#039;s Brechtian cinematic practices are this film&amp;#039;s answer.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7020a9491885cff58c08aef569b6362e0144cd5","amp;dn":"Ingmar.Bergman.A.Passion.1969.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7020a9491885cff58c08aef569b6362e0144cd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,2,10,148,145,136,92,255,88,192,138,239,86,155,99,98,224,20,76,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
