Claridge (Pergamon, 1999).djvu\r\n\r\nFrom the initial observation of proton magnetic resonance in water and in paraffin, the discipline of nuclear magnetic resonance has seen unparalleled growth as an analytical method. Modern NMR spectroscopy is a highly developed, yet still evolving, subject which finds application in chemistry, biology, medicine, materials science and geology.\r\nIn this book, emphasis is on the more recently developed methods of solution-state NMR applicable to chemical research, which are chosen for their wide applicability and robustness. These have, in many cases, already become established techniques in NMR laboratories, in both academic and industrial establishments. A considerable amount of information and guidance is given on the implementation and execution of the techniques described in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acaf109e49edbb3ae00c304751cc27fd5825d4be","amp;dn":"High-resolutions+NMniques+in+Organic+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acaf109e49edbb3ae00c304751cc27fd5825d4be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,175,16,158,73,237,187,58,224,12,48,71,81,204,39,253,88,37,212,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
