After 34 days and more than 5,000 casualties - including those injured - a ceasefire was signed, and the geopolitics of the region were changed immeasurably. A #1 bestseller in Israel for months, 34 Days brilliantly reconstructs the progression of the war, from the soldiers' abduction through the hasty Israeli decision for an agressive response; the fateful discussions within the Cabinet and among senior Israeli command; and the heavy fighting in south Lebanon. It also delves into the raging diplomatic battles that took place in Paris, Washington, and New York, which would eventually end the war.\n\n\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A gripping account of the Israel-Lebanon conflict.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--Newsweek\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Based on hundreds of interviews with players on both sides, the book is a thorough, clear-eyed (neither side escapes hard censure) view a of short-lived war, the influence of which is, and will continue to be, widely felt.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ --Globe and Mail, Canada\n\nPraise for Harel and IssachorffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Seventh War:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In this book, journalists Harel and Isacharoff trace the trajectory of the conflict. Though the authors are Israeli they take both sides to task.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ --Newsweek\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Perhaps the most valuable aspect of Amos HarelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Avi IsacharoffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excellent book, The Seventh War is that for the first time in more than four years of warfare, one can take a break and read a comprehensive work of journalism which allows a degree of perspective.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ --Jerusalem Post\nAbout the Author\nAMOS HAREL is the Ha'aretz newspaper's military correspondent.
