Ant then gets into past girlfriends and what future ones can expect, going through peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s phones, and engages in some caller Russian roulette. We get a recap of Al SharptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 60th birthday bash, talk about Montel Williams, and are treated to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Throwback Thursday.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He goes through un-PC commercials from the past, we watch a PSA from Canada, and Ticket University helps another lucky soul to be unblocked. We see a terrible viral video, learn about Oculus Rift, get an update on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sperm woman,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ watch some roller coaster videos, and yay, we hear from more callers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8f20ea2d3f4963118d0f877e45a6082040684b","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-10-02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8f20ea2d3f4963118d0f877e45a6082040684b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,143,32,234,45,63,73,99,17,141,15,135,126,69,166,8,32,64,104,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
