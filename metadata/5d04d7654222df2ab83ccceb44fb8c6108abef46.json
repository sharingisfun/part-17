Credited solely to the band's bassist, Steve Harris, although significant contributions were made by lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, it remains one of their most popular songs, with VH1 ranking it No. 27 on their list of the 40 Greatest Metal Songs and No. 14 on their list of the Greatest Hard Rock Songs. \n\nA live version of the song, from Live After Death, was released in 1985 and the original single was reissued in 2005, with all income donated to former drummer Clive Burr's MS Trust Fund.\n\nFollowing former drummer Clive Burr's announcement that he was suffering from multiple sclerosis, &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; was released again in 2002 to raise money for the newly established Clive Burr MS Trust Fund.[14] Two variations were issued, the original studio version and a live version taken from the Rock in Rio concert, with different B-sides. \n\nTrack Listing [2002 Single] [320k MP3]\n\n&quot;Run to the Hills&quot; (studio) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n&quot;Run to the Hills&quot; (live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rio Brazil 19 January 2001) (Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:00\n&quot;Children of the Damned&quot; (live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ London 20 March 1982) (Smith, Harris) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:34\n&quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot; (live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reading Festival, 1982) (Harris,Smith) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:34\n&quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ London 20 March 1982) (Murray, Harris, Burr) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59\n&quot;The Prisoner&quot; (live Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reading Festival, (Harris, Smith) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d04d7654222df2ab83ccceb44fb8c6108abef46","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Run+To+The+Hills+%5BSingle%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d04d7654222df2ab83ccceb44fb8c6108abef46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,4,215,101,66,34,223,42,184,60,204,235,68,251,140,97,8,171,239,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
