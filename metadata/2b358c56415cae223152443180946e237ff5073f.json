Her best-selling album to date is Surfacing, for which she won two Grammy Awards (out of three nominations) and eight Juno Awards. In addition to her personal artistic efforts, she founded the Lilith Fair tour, which showcased female musicians in the late 1990s.\n\nSarah McLachlan was born on January 28, 1968, and adopted in Halifax, Nova Scotia. As a child, she took voice lessons, along with studies in classical piano and guitar. When she was 17 years old, and still a student at Queen Elizabeth High School, she fronted a short-lived rock band called The October Game. One of the band's songs, &quot;Grind&quot;, credited as a group composition, can be found on the independent Flamingo Records release 'Out of the Fog' and the CD 'Out of the Fog Too'. It has yet to be released elsewhere. Her high school yearbook predicted that she was &quot;destined to become a famous rock star.&quot;\n\nFollowing The October Game's first concert at Dalhousie University opening for Moev, McLachlan was offered a recording contract with Vancouver-based independent record label Nettwerk by Moev's Mark Jowett. McLachlan's parents persuaded her to finish her studies at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design before embarking on a new life as a recording artist, and McLachlan finally signed to Nettwerk two years later before having written a single song.\n\nIn 1997, Sarah McLachlan married her drummer, Ashwin Sood, in Jamaica. McLachlan lost her mother to cancer in December 2001, while McLachlan herself was pregnant. McLachlan gave birth to a daughter, whom she named India Ann Sushil Sood, on April 6, 2002, in Vancouver. By this time, McLachlan had already completed three-quarters of the production on her next record, Afterglow. On June 24, 2007, she gave birth to her second daughter, Taja Summer Sood, in Vancouver. McLachlan announced her separation from Ashwin Sood in September 2008.[5[/quote]\n\n\n\nSTUDIO ALBUMS \n\n\n\n\n\nTouch \n\n\n\nTouch is the debut album by Sarah McLachlan which was released in 1988 and then re-released in 1989.\n\nThe album was originally released in 1988 by Nettwerk. McLachlan later signed to Arista Records internationally (although remaining on Nettwerk in Canada), and a revamped version of Touch, with several remixed songs and a new track, was released in 1989 on both labels. The original 1988 release was discontinued by Nettwerk, and is now considered a collector's item. It is distinguished by its black and sepia cover. The first released single from the album was &quot;Vox&quot; in 1988, followed by &quot;Steaming&quot; in 1989.\n\nThe album was popular in alternative rock circles, but McLachlan would not achieve commercial stardom until 1991 in Canada, with Solace, and 1994 (1995 in some countries) internationally, with her 1993 album Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\n\nIn 1993, McLachlan and Nettwerk were sued by Darryl Neudorf, a Vancouver musician and former member of 54-40, who alleged that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on Touch. Although both McLachlan and Nettwerk acknowledged that Neudorf was involved in the album's production, both took the position that his contribution had not been primarily in songwriting. The judge in that suit ultimately ruled in McLachlan's favour.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Out of the Shadows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57 (McLachlan) \n2.\t&quot;Vox&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48 (McLachlan) \n3.\t&quot;Strange World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 (McLachlan) \n4.\t&quot;Trust&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45 (McLachlan/Phillips/Nikleva/Sawatzky/Iwaschuk) \n5.\t&quot;Touch&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11 (McLachlan) \n6.\t&quot;Steaming&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46 (McLachlan/Phillips) \n7.\t&quot;Sad Clown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 (McLachlan) \n8.\t&quot;Uphill Battle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37 (McLachlan/Phillips) \n9.\t&quot;Ben's Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55 (McLachlan) \n10.\t&quot;Vox (Extended Version)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:49 (McLachlan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolace \n\n\n\nSolace is a 1991 album by Sarah McLachlan. It was the album that first made her a star in Canada, spawning the hit singles &quot;The Path of Thorns (Terms)&quot; and &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and being certified double platinum for sales of 200,000 copies in Canada.\n\nAlthough the album received favourable reviews internationally, her commercial breakthrough outside of Canada would not come until her next full album, Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Drawn to the Rhythm&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \n2.\t&quot;Into the Fire&quot; (Sarah McLachlan and Pierre Marchand) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34 \n3.\t&quot;The Path of Thorns (Terms)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:51 \n4.\t&quot;I Will Not Forget You&quot; (McLachlan, Darren Phillips) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:20 \n5.\t&quot;Lost&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:03 \n6.\t&quot;Back Door Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00 \n7.\t&quot;Shelter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 \n8.\t&quot;Black&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04 \n9.\t&quot;Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45 \n10.\t&quot;Mercy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFumbling Towards Ecstasy \n\n\n\nFumbling Towards Ecstasy is an album by Sarah McLachlan. It was produced by Pierre Marchand in Montreal, and released in 1993.\n\nThe album was an immediate hit in Canada, where McLachlan was already an established star. Over the next two years, it became her breakthrough album internationally as well. However, in some countries, most notably the United States, the album was a steady seller that stayed in the middle ranges of the pop charts for almost two years, rather than the #1 smash that McLachlan would achieve with 1997's Surfacing.\n\n&quot;Possession&quot;, the album's first single, is written from the point of view of an obsessed fan. Following the album's release, a fan named Uwe Vandrei sued McLachlan for songwriting credit, claiming that his letters were used as the basis of the song. The case never made it to trial as Vandrei was found dead of apparent suicide in November 1994.\n\nSome editions contain an album version of McLachlan's 1995 single used for The Brothers McMullen soundtrack, &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;. The track's lyrics do not appear in the booklet, nor strangely does the track's crediting information.\n\nAugust 5, 2008 saw the release of the 15th anniversary 3-disc edition the album. The set includes the original remastered album, The Freedom Sessions and a DVD that includes live performances, music videos and more. The album was released by Legacy Recordings.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Possession&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39 \n2.\t&quot;Wait&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09 \n3.\t&quot;Plenty&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n4.\t&quot;Good Enough&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03 \n5.\t&quot;Mary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n6.\t&quot;Elsewhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44 \n7.\t&quot;Circle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43 \n8.\t&quot;Ice&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 \n9.\t&quot;Hold On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09 \n10.\t&quot;Ice Cream&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44 \n11.\t&quot;Fear&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 \n12.\t&quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:49 ( including several minutes of silence followed by a hidden track, a solo piano version of &quot;Possession&quot; )\n\n\n\n\n\nSurfacing \n\n\nSurfacing is a 1997 album by Canadian musician Sarah McLachlan. It was produced by Pierre Marchand.\n\nIt was McLachlan's bestselling album, debuting at number one or number two on the Top 40 charts in many countries, and officially confirming her star status in many countries (most notably the United States) where her 1993 album Fumbling Towards Ecstasy had been a steady seller but didn't fully establish McLachlan as a mainstream pop star.\n\nIt was released as McLachlan embarked on the Lilith Fair concert tour.\n\n&quot;Full of Grace&quot; was not a new song, having previously appeared on the collection Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff. The track &quot;Do What You Have to Do&quot; entered the news in 1998, when it was cited in Kenneth Starr's report as the subject of a letter from Monica Lewinsky to Bill Clinton. The song &quot;Angel&quot;, a single in 1999, enjoyed renewed visibility in 2001, when it became popular as a song of comfort and healing following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center.\n\nThis album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, which was awarded to James Taylor's Hourglass, however the singer won the Best Pop Instrumental Performance award for the track &quot;Last Dance&quot; at the Grammy Awards of 1998 [1].\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Building a Mystery&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07 (McLachlan/Marchand) \n2.\t&quot;I Love You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44 (McLachlan) \n3.\t&quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00 (McLachlan) \n4.\t&quot;Adia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 (McLachlan/Marchand) \n5.\t&quot;Do What You Have to Do&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 (McLachlan/Wolstenholme) \n6.\t&quot;Witness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45 (McLachlan/Marchand) \n7.\t&quot;Angel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30 (McLachlan) \n8.\t&quot;Black &amp; White&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 (McLachlan) \n9.\t&quot;Full of Grace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41 (McLachlan) \n10.\t&quot;Last Dance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:33 (McLachlan)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterglow \n\n\nAfterglow is a 2003 album by Sarah McLachlan.\n\nIt was her first album of new material in six years, after the success of Surfacing and the Lilith Fair festival. Following those successes, McLachlan took a few years furlough to start a family with her husband and drummer, Ashwin Sood. Their daughter, India Ann Sushill Sood, was born in 2002.\n\nShe also did a lot of work with the Sarah McLachlan Music Outreach program, funding music lessons for disadvantaged children.\n\nUnlike past albums where she went to an isolated cottage to write the songs, she wrote the songs for Afterglow in her family home mainly before the birth of her child. She wrote the songs entirely on piano, which is also a departure from her previous albums which she wrote on guitar. Longtime collaborator Pierre Marchand produced the album. McLachlan wrote all of the songs on the album, including two she wrote with Marchand.\n\nThe song &quot;Answer&quot; was featured in the 2008 movie The Brave One, starring Jodie Foster\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Fallen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47 (McLachlan) \n2.\t&quot;World on Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22 (McLachlan, Marchand) \n3.\t&quot;Stupid&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:24 (McLachlan) \n4.\t&quot;Drifting&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:23 (McLachlan) \n5.\t&quot;Train Wreck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36 (McLachlan) \n6.\t&quot;Push&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 (McLachlan) \n7.\t&quot;Answer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58 (McLachlan) \n8.\t&quot;Time&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07 (McLachlan) \n9.\t&quot;Perfect Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43 (McLachlan, Marchand) \n10.\t&quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56 (McLachlan) \n\n\n\n\n\nWintersong \n\n\nWintersong is a Grammy-nominated, holiday album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, released in October 2006.
