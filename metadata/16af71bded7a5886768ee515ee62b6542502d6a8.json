Not the sort of place you'd expect to find witchcraft? (Well, it can be a bit behind the times up there, so maybe......)\n\nJournalist Ellie Rogers is sent to Norfolk to investigate rumours of witchcraft, her colleague having had an accident earlier in he investigation. Her boss thinks it is all nonsense and just wants to get Ellie out of the way, but when Ellie gets there, she witnesses some terrifying events.\n\nA bit silly at times, but I'm not a horror fan, though good fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16af71bded7a5886768ee515ee62b6542502d6a8","amp;dn":"Book+of+Shadows+-+BBC+Radio+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16af71bded7a5886768ee515ee62b6542502d6a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,175,113,189,237,122,88,134,118,142,229,21,238,98,182,84,37,2,214,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
