Although he is primarily associated with Pub rock and New Wave, and had numerous hits in the 1970s and early 1980s, his natural leaning has always been towards 1950s style rock and roll.\n\n\nEdmunds recorded less frequently after the mid 1980s, living in Wales in semi-retirement, but occasionally touring. He joined up with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band for tours in 1992 and 2000. However, 2007 marked a return to touring for Edmunds, alongside Joe Brown, on a lengthy tour around the UK. He made an appearance on stage alongside Stray Cats, at the Brixton Academy in London, on 10 September 2008, playing &quot;The Race Is On&quot; and &quot;Tear It Up&quot; with the band.\n\nIn 1993 Edmunds unexpectedly found himself in Cardiff Crown Court as a co-defendant along with Shakin' Stevens facing charges of non-payment of playing royalties from former Sunsets' band members Robert Llewellyn, Carl Petersen, Steve Percy and Paul Dolan. The prosecution asserted that the former band members were due a share of those additional royalties that Stevens and Edmunds had received from the successful reissue of the album A Legend during the early eighties. The judge agreed and, while the unpaid royalties only amounted to around Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£70,000 to be divided between the four musicians, the associated court costs to be paid by Stevens and Edmunds amounted to Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£500,000.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2008 he appeared on Jools Holland's annual Hootenanny, performing &quot;Girls Talk&quot; and &quot;I Hear You Knocking&quot;. He was Holland's guest again at Borde Hill Garden on 20 June 2009, on 28 August at open air concert at Carrickfergus Castle., 31 October at Ipswich Regent, 7 November at Stoke Victoria Hall and 14 November at Nottingham Concert Hall. Edmunds also played a five song set, including &quot;I Hear You Knocking,&quot; &quot;I Knew the Bride&quot; and &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; with the Holland Big Band at the Royal Albert Hall on 27 November 2009.\n\nHe returned and performed Sabre Dance on Hootenanny on the 2009/10 edition.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Edmunds&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Edmunds&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
