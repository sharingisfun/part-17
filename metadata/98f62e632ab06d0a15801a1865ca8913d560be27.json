What's more, they worked.\n\nNow, incredibly, Russian engines are being used to launch American rockets.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5787437371570928#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5787437371570928#&lt;/a&gt;\n\nChannel 4 - Equinox: The Engines That Came In From The Cold\nEnglish | 50Min | 640x416 | XviD - 1267Kbps | 25.000fps | MP3 - 128Kbps | 490MB\nGenre: Documentary","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f62e632ab06d0a15801a1865ca8913d560be27","amp;dn":"Channel+4+-+Equinox%3A+The+Engines+That+Came+In+From+The+Cold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f62e632ab06d0a15801a1865ca8913d560be27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,246,46,99,42,176,109,10,21,128,26,24,101,202,137,19,213,96,190,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
