Verso Books, 2013.\n\nISBN 9781844679904 | 160 pages | PDF\n\nIrascible and forthright, Christopher Hitchens stood out as a man determined to do just that. In his younger years, a career-minded socialist, he emerged from the smoke of 9/11 a neoconservative &quot;Marxist,&quot; an advocate of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s invasion of Iraq filled with passionate intensity. Throughout his life, he played the role of universal gadfly, whose commitment to the truth transcended the party line as well as received wisdom. But how much of this was imposture? In this highly critical study, Richard Seymour casts a cold eye over the career of the &quot;Hitch&quot; to uncover an intellectual trajectory determined by expediency and a fetish for power.\n\nAs an orator and writer, Hitchens offered something unique and highly marketable. But for all his professed individualism, he remains a recognizable historical type -- the apostate leftist. &quot;Unhitched&quot; presents a rewarding and entertaining case study, one that is also a cautionary tale for our times.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead8b1fcf5670077b93c71d55ab0ba9ffa681d55","amp;dn":"Unhitched+-+The+Trial+of+Christopher+Hitchens+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead8b1fcf5670077b93c71d55ab0ba9ffa681d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,216,177,252,245,103,0,119,185,60,113,213,90,176,186,159,250,104,29,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
