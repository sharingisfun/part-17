Many church ministers think that non-profit organizations are charitable corporations that are not for profit and the donations we make to them can be deducted off their income tax. What they aren't aware of that by declaring their ministry as a 501(C)(3) non-profit organization they are by law united with the government and therefore become a government church which is also an incorporated business entity. This fascinating legal treatise goes way back in history to trace the origins of corporations and concludes that they cannot be the ground that the Christian church is based upon. Yet another Mystery Babylon deception? It sure seems so. 22 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c4196d8978839f15200b39eb48b6776910526b","amp;dn":"Church+Inc-Corruption+of+American+Christianity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8c4196d8978839f15200b39eb48b6776910526b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,196,25,109,137,120,131,159,21,32,11,57,235,72,182,119,105,16,82,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
