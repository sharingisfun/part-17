The Volume 1 CD2 is actually part of the &quot;Extra features&quot; but it leadson so hence I named it CD2. I know the sound is very slightly out of sync on that rip, but it&amp;#039;s also out of sync on the dvd (Tried in several drives.) All rips are 4:3 as the dvds. \n\nFTW?\nChiggyman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0141717e5a6c77286452cd654ca6c8a60381f560","amp;dn":"Jackass+Volumes+1%2C2+%26+3.+%28DVD+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0141717e5a6c77286452cd654ca6c8a60381f560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,65,113,126,90,108,119,40,100,82,205,101,76,166,200,166,3,129,245,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
