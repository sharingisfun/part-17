He's as good in comedies also! No one else comes to mind for playing Dr Ben Carson with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Torn between his loyalty to his skills as a surgeon and a lack of faith in himself made this film all the more realistic! Cuba and Elise give performances that are amazing to watch! Comments to another forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie while at the school...&quot;but&quot; it can't get any realer than that. I've seen it with my own eyes while attending colleges &amp; this film really puts it down. Very emotional &amp; inspiring film. Thanks to everyone involved for bringing us this fantastic true story!\n\nPortuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af8b07f63d195d4b552d00c59301bddf85a33b9b","amp;dn":"Gifted+Hands+The+Ben+Carson+Story+-+%28Legendas+Ok%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af8b07f63d195d4b552d00c59301bddf85a33b9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,139,7,246,61,25,93,75,85,45,0,197,147,1,189,223,133,163,59,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
