But the vast secret agency has also seen its share of problems, and recent cases like the Aldrich Ames scandal have exposed them. THE 20th CENTURY traces the history of the CIA from its origins in 1947 through the disturbing revelations that have made many question its role toady. Dramatic footage and interviews with former agents, government officials and reporters trace its defining moments from the Cuban missile crisis to the U-2 spy plane, the Iran-Contra scandal to the agency's role in Vietnam. Experts explain why the CIA remains vital in the post-Cold War world, while others point to cases like the Ames' scandal as evidence of its inability to adapt to the new global reality, or even monitor its own operations. It's a fascinating examination of the massive agency that is celebrating &quot;&quot;50 Years of Silent Service.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea846863cf7259afabf4960261f2d7c519597665","amp;dn":"The+CIA%3A+50+Years+of+Spying","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea846863cf7259afabf4960261f2d7c519597665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,132,104,99,207,114,89,175,171,244,150,2,97,242,215,197,25,89,118,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
