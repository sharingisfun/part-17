Author of more than 20 works of fiction, he has been nominated three times for the Nobel Prize in Literature and twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize.  He writes simultaneously in both Afrikaans and English and is a Professor of English at the University of Cape Town.\n\nIn the 1960s he, Ingrid Jonker and Breyten Breytenbach were key figures in the Afrikaans literary movement known as Die Sestigers (&quot;The Sixty-ers&quot;).  They sought to use Afrikaans as a language to speak against the apartheid government, and also to bring into Afrikaans literature the influence of contemporary English and French trends.\n\nWhile Brink's early novels were especially concerned with apartheid, his more recent work engages the new range issues posed by life in a democratic South Africa.\n\n\nThe following novels are in either PDF or EPUB format:\n\n* A CHAIN OF VOICES (Faber &amp; Faber, 1982; rep. 2007) -- PDF\n\n* AN INSTANT IN THE WIND (W.
