Author Gini Courter walks you through two toolsets: the self-service BI tools that only require Excel, and Power BI, which relies on Office 365. Using the Power Query, Power Pivot, Power Map, and Power View tools in Excel 2013, you'll learn to connect to local and remote data sources, model that data, and present your findings in the form of tables, charts, maps, and reports. Then Gini switches to Power BI to enhance and share the queries and reports you just created. As you'll soon find in the course of these tutorials, Microsoft's BI tools allow you to use the software you already know and love to analyze and share complex business data.\nTopics include:\nUnderstanding data analysis and business intelligence\nInstalling Office BI add-ins\nSearching for online data with Power Query\nShaping data in the Query Editor\nConnecting to data sources\nModeling data with Power Pivot\nEnhancing PivotTables and PivotCharts with PowerPoint\nVisualizing geospatial data with Power Map\nCreating and formatting Power View reports\nSharing your data using Power BI for Office 365\n\nfrom Lynda.com\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Power-BI-Office-365-tutorials/Power-BI-Features-Depth/156763-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lynda.com/Power-BI-Office-365-tutorials/Power-BI-Features-Depth/156763-2.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile .rar\nVideo files mp4\nTotal Duration 5h 49m\nIncluding Exersice files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a1aa320b97fb7ccf10da53118f541ec1ab495d6","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+-+Power+BI+%5BBusiness-Intellegence%5D+Features+in+Depth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a1aa320b97fb7ccf10da53118f541ec1ab495d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,26,163,32,185,127,183,204,241,13,165,49,24,245,65,236,26,180,149,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
