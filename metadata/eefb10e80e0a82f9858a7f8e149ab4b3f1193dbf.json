Paul Wilson, hailed by the Rocky Mountain News as Ã¢â‚¬Å“among the finest storytellers of our times.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe title novelette won the Bram Stoker Award and its companions touch on the past, present, and futureÃ¢â‚¬â€from the inflationary insanity of Weimar Germany (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Aryans and AbsintheÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to disco clubÃ¢â‚¬â€œera Manhattan (Ã¢â‚¬Å“When He Was FabÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), to the rationing of medical services in a grim near future (Ã¢â‚¬Å“OffshoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). \n\nWilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stylistic diversity and versatility are on display in stories that pay tribute to Ray Bradbury (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The November GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), use a sentient killer virus as a point-of-view character (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lysing toward BethlehemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and pay unabashed homage to pure pulp fiction in two yellow peril stories (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sex Slaves of the Dragon TongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Part of the GameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). And finally, Wilson treats us to his popular antihero Repairman Jack at his most inventive: trapped in a drugstore with four killers (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Interlude at DuaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).\n\nGenre: Science Fiction, Horror, Anthology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eefb10e80e0a82f9858a7f8e149ab4b3f1193dbf","amp;dn":"Aftershock+%26amp%3B+Others%3A+16+Oddities+by+F+Paul+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eefb10e80e0a82f9858a7f8e149ab4b3f1193dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,251,16,232,14,10,130,249,133,138,127,142,20,154,180,179,241,25,61,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
