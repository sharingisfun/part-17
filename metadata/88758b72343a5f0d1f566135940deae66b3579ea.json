Ambrose &quot;How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching&quot;\nISBN: 0470484101 | 2010 | PDF | 336 pages | 1,6 MB\n\nDistilling the research literature and translating the scientific approach into language relevant to a college or university teacher, this book introduces seven general principles of how students learn. The authors have drawn on research from a breadth of perspectives (cognitive, developmental, and social psychology; educational research; anthropology; demographics; organizational behavior) to identify a set of key principles underlying learning, from how effective organization enhances retrieval and use of information to what impacts motivation. Integrating theory with real-classroom examples in practice, this book helps faculty to apply cognitive science advances to improve their own teaching.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88758b72343a5f0d1f566135940deae66b3579ea","amp;dn":"How+Learning+Works%3A+Seven+Research-Based+Principles+for+Smart+Te","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88758b72343a5f0d1f566135940deae66b3579ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,117,139,114,52,58,95,13,31,86,97,53,148,13,234,230,107,53,121,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
