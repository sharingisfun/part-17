Enlisting the talents of former Serpentcult singer Michelle Nocon, current Serpentcult drummer Frederik Cosemans, and TortureramaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bassist Raf Meukens, the Anglo-Belgian assembly is ready to conquer Europe. Hot on the heels of the ridiculously catchy 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Sign Of Times, their self-titled debut promises a fiery explosion of doom &amp; roll.\n\nAfter the short instrumental Ã¢â‚¬Å“Grotesque HorizonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the stage is set for the witchesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Sabbath. NoconÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pipes are intense and carry a punk rock attitude, with JenningsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heavy metal riffs ramping up the aggression from the comparably safe-sounding 7Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½. Despite the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moniker, the opening tracks of Death Penalty sound closer to an Iron Maiden, or even a Manilla Road, than the gloom of Witchfinder General. The galloping Ã¢â‚¬Å“Eyes Of The HereticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an early highlight, featuring an achingly addictive chorus, thundering riffs and a brilliant vocal performance. In my review of Sign Of Times I lamented the rather anonymous rhythm-section. Here it all comes together excellently, letting both Coseman and Meukens step out of JenningsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ long shadow. As a result, the group feels less like a solo-project and more like a proper band.\n\nWith such a riff-machine at their helm itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unsurprising that Death Penalty is bursting with excellent hooks. Besides instant earworms such as the MotÃƒÂ¶rhead-esque Ã¢â‚¬Å“Immortal By Your HandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the band occasionally slows down to a menacing doom metal crawl. Rather than coming off as simply Cathedral with a female singer, Death Penalty are actively pursuing a sound of their own, with songs that feel tailored for NoconÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunting voice. Changing up the formula proves a winning strategy; crushing moments like Ã¢â‚¬Å“The One That DwellsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ring out eerily when paired with the remarkably infectious melodies of the fantastic closing number Ã¢â‚¬Å“Written By The InsaneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. This constant interplay between the energetic and the hefty pays off; an hour feels like minutes when under the spell of Death Penalty.\n\nExpanding on the promising Sign Of Times, Death Penalty have proven their worth with a towering collection of hard-rocking tunes and deafening doom metal. An utter joy of an album, Death Penalty will leave you humming for days. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another solid addition to the already breathtaking roster of Rise Above Records, and a damn fine slice of doom.\n\n2014 Death Penalty\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Grotesque Horizon\n2.
