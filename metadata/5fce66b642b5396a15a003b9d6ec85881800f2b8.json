With particular emphasis on the last 200 years, this balanced analysis stresses the historical importance of warfare and military structures in the shaping of modern South African society. Important themes include military adaptation during the process of colonial conquest and African resistance, the growth of South Africa as a regional military power from the early 20th century, and South African involvement in conflicts of the decolonization era.\n\nOrganized chronologically, each chapter reviews the major conflicts, policies, and military issues of a specific period in South African history. Coverage includes the wars of colonial conquest (1830-69), the diamond wars (1869-81), the gold wars (1886-1910), World Wars I and II (1910-45), and the apartheid wars (1948-94).\n\n\n\nPrint Length: 229 pages\nPublisher: Praeger; 1 edition (April 9, 2010)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B005UVQWQA\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Military-History-South-Africa-ebook/dp/B005UVQWQA/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Military-History-South-Africa-ebook/dp/B005UVQWQA/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTags: military, history, south africa, rhodesia, zimbabwe, army, boer, apartheid, anc, duth, afrikaans, dutch, india, britain, uk, Joburg, boer war, bantu, xhosa, zulu, praetoria, praetorian, executive outcomes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fce66b642b5396a15a003b9d6ec85881800f2b8","amp;dn":"A+Military+History+of+South+Africa%3A+From+the+Dutch-Khoi+Wars+to+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fce66b642b5396a15a003b9d6ec85881800f2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,206,102,182,66,181,57,106,21,160,3,185,214,236,133,136,24,0,242,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
