Keith Brindley introduces readers to the functions of the main component types, their uses, and the basic principles of building and designing electronic circuits. Breadboard layouts make this very much a ready-to-run book for the experimenter, and the use of multimeter, but not oscilloscopes, and readily available, inexpensive components makes the practical work achievable in a home or school setting as well as a fully equipped lab. This third edition has kept the simplicity and clarity of the original, with new material including sections on transducers and more practical examples of digital ICs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:312fbd7a8deff096c56d61a11f502e505e9a7d2e","amp;dn":"Starting+Electronics%2C+3rd+Ed++-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"312fbd7a8deff096c56d61a11f502e505e9a7d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,47,189,122,141,239,240,150,197,109,97,161,31,80,46,80,94,154,125,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
