Iraq war veteran Walter Sherman (Geoff Stults) gained a reputation in his army days as being the go-to guy for tracking down insurgents and deserters and finding improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Unfortunately one IED found Walter before he could find it, resulting in severe brain damage with a lasting and unexpected effect. Walter transformed from someone skilled at the standard recovery of people and things in wartime scenarios to someone - something - much more extraordinary: a Finder. Walter left the military, but his reputation as a discreet professional able to unearth anything and anyone passed on to generals, politicians and other powerful figures. \n\n\nVertaling: Jesse, Quetsbeek en DÃƒÂ©sirÃƒÂ©e\n\n\nSeizoen 1 Aflevering 6: Little Green Men\n\nDr. Jack Hodgins from the Jeffersonian team seeks Walter's help to find evidence that could expose extraterrestrial activity.
