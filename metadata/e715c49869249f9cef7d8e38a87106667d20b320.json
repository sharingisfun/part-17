The original audio was seperated into tracks of about 3 minutes each, and I found their number to be just too large so I combined the tracks into chapters)\n\nHave fun,\nHironimo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e715c49869249f9cef7d8e38a87106667d20b320","amp;dn":"The+Guardians+of+Ga%5C%27Hoole+Audio-Books+1-8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e715c49869249f9cef7d8e38a87106667d20b320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,21,196,152,105,36,159,156,239,125,142,56,168,113,6,102,125,32,179,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
