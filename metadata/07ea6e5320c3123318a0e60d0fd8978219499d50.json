Cengel\nISBN-13: 978-0072458930\nISBN-10: 0072458933\nEdition: 2nd\n\nWith complete coverage of the basic principles of heat transfer and a broad range of applications in a flexible format, Heat and Mass Transfer: Fundamentals and Applications by Yunus Cengel and Afshin Ghajar provides the perfect blend of fundamentals and applications. The text provides a highly intuitive and practical understanding of the material by emphasizing the physics and the underlying physical phenomena involved.\n\nThis text covers the standard topics of heat transfer with an emphasis on physics and real-world every day applications, while de-emphasizing the intimidating heavy mathematical aspects. This approach is designed to take advantage of students' intuition, making the learning process easier and more engaging. Key: 50% of the Homework Problems including design, computer, essay, lab-type, and FE problems are new or revised to this edition. Using a reader-friendly approach and a conversational writing style, the book is self-instructive and entertains while it teaches. It shows that highly technical matter can be communicated effectively in a simple yet precise language.
