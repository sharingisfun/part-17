The recording \r\nis a very good balanced professional board tape\r\n\r\nAudience Source: \r\nIncomplete very good audience recording. The tape \r\nis somewhat distant but clear. \r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Intro (1:35)\r\n02. Train Kept a Rollin' (2:55)\r\n03. Nobody's Fault but Mine (6:12)\r\n04. Black Dog (6:40)\r\n05. In the Evening (10:20)\r\n06. The Rain Song (8:06)\r\n07. Hot Dog (3:48)\r\n08. All my Love (6:30)\r\n09. Trampled Under Foot (9:03)\r\n10. Since I've been Loving You (9:30)\r\n11. Achilles Last Stand (10:47)\r\n12. White Summer/Black Mountain Side (8:16)\r\n13. Kashmir (10:55)\r\n14. Stairway to Heaven (17:13)\r\n15. Communication Breakdown (3:02)\r\n16. Rock and Roll (3:49)\r\n\r\nComments: A better show than the night before, although \r\nstill sluggish in some places. The opening numbers are \r\ngood, including an extended The Train Kept A Rollin'. \r\nOverall, the show is very good although as a whole not \r\nquite as good as previous ones on the tour. Still, they \r\nare in high sprits and play very well, including a great \r\nmiddle string of numbers. The only weak link is Stairway \r\nTo Heaven, with Robert giving it a deliberate lounge act \r\nreading, showing the band's apathy for it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9133825336eb7f5ebcd340decaf5a520bb5c4f19","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1980.07.03+Mannheim%2C+Germany+%28Matrix%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9133825336eb7f5ebcd340decaf5a520bb5c4f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,51,130,83,54,235,127,94,188,211,64,222,202,245,165,32,187,92,79,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
