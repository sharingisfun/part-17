He worked with bebop legends Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. In the mid 1950's he formed a group with Horace Silver with which he would be associated for the next 35 years: the Jazz Messengers. The Messengers were formed as a collective of contemporaries, but over the years the band became known as an incubator for young talent, including such luminaries as Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter and Wynton Marsalis. The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz calls the Jazz Messengers &quot;the archetypal hard-bop group of the late '50s...&quot;\n\nArt Blakey &amp; the Jazz Messengers hit their artistic peak with the powerful A Night in Tunisia. This incarnation of the group included Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Timmons, and Jymie Merritt along with their leader, Blakey. As the Messengers entered their most fruitful period for Blue Note, Blakey drove his men relentlessly with powerful grooves, heavy swinging, and shouts of encouragement. This session documents the full power of his assertive leadership and the masterful playing of his sidemen, each rising to legendary status under his tutelage. Long known for their creative arrangements within the context of small-group jazz, the Messengers push the definition of hard bop and blues to the limit here. Dizzy Gillespie's title track is evidence enough of the creative power of this group: Blakey's steam shovel-like mambo, Morgan and Shorter's wailing solos, and a dramatic ending make for a stunning piece. Shorter's contribution includes the swinging &quot;Sincerely Diana.&quot; The soulful Bobby Timmons presents his delightful &quot;So Tired,&quot; a bluesy number in the spirit of his classic &quot;Dat Dere.&quot; Also included are Lee Morgan's smoky &quot;Yama,&quot; the bouncing &quot;Kozo's Waltz,&quot; and the classic &quot;When Your Lover Has Gone.&quot;\n\nHDTracks-PCM-42Bit-192Khz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24ca3b4f16b7c0f4782a47d858265500d84fc59","amp;dn":"Art+Blakey+-+A+Night+In+Tunisia+%281960%29+2013+HDTracks+24-192-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24ca3b4f16b7c0f4782a47d858265500d84fc59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,76,163,180,241,107,124,15,71,130,164,125,133,130,101,80,13,132,252,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
