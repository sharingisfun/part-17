Thanks also to a more consistent set of songs, the results are magnificent -- given room to breathe, Joplin's trademark rasp conveys an aching, desperate passion on funked-up, bluesy rockers, ballads both dramatic and tender, and her signature song, the posthumous number one hit &quot;Me and Bobby McGee.&quot; The unfinished &quot;Buried Alive in the Blues&quot; features no Joplin vocals -- she was scheduled to record them on the day after she was found dead. Its incompleteness mirrors Joplin's career; Pearl's power leaves the listener to wonder what else Joplin could have accomplished, but few artists could ask for a better final statement\n\n\nDate\n February, 1971 \n\nGenre\nPop/Rock\n\n\nStyles\nAlbum Rock\nBlues-Rock\nHard Rock\nRock &amp; Roll\n\n\nRecording Date\n\nJuly 4, 1970 - October 2, 1970\nSubmit Corrections \n\nAlbum Moods\n\nGritty  Sexual  Street-Smart  Bravado  Greasy  Warm  Confident  Confrontational  Dramatic  Fiery  Intimate  Reflective  Rousing  Urgent  Bittersweet  Cathartic  Passionate  Rambunctious  Aggressive  Brash  Earnest  Earthy  Freewheeling  Intense  Raucous  Rollicking  Rowdy  Visceral  Exuberant  Melancholy  \n\n\nThemes\n\nRegret  Breakup  Girls Night Out  Heartache  Scary Music  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e4e96ae3dfcb73bf40d68c12f0ce8820fe3932","amp;dn":"1971+Janis+Joplin%2BFTF-+Pearl+%5BVinyl+24bit-192khz%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e4e96ae3dfcb73bf40d68c12f0ce8820fe3932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,228,233,106,227,223,203,115,191,64,214,140,18,240,206,136,32,254,57,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
