As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward - wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders - his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.\n\nEgwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower - and possibly the world itself.\n\nThe Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c54c8cd3ae271388d5470157a1f65eabc9f1a3","amp;dn":"The+Gathering+Storm+Brandon+Sanderson%2C+Robert+Jordan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7c54c8cd3ae271388d5470157a1f65eabc9f1a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,197,76,140,211,174,39,19,136,213,71,1,87,161,246,94,171,201,241,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
