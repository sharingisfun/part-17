It saw the use of military equipment on a scale never experienced before. One of the most popular and most often employed vehicles of that time was the tank. Each side of the conflict had at its disposal at least one tank type which made it into history books. In Tank Combat, you can become the commander of each of them! \n\nTake the helm of the most famous tanks of the Second World War; the American &quot;General Stuart&quot;, the German &quot;Tiger&quot; and the infamous Soviet T34. Each vehicle was recreated with an incredible attention to detail and great faithfulness to the original. \n\nParticipate in three dramatic campaigns: skirmishes in Northern Africa, the siege of Leningrad and the defence of the German Vaterland. Fight on realistic battlefields, in changing weather conditions, and destroy nearly every element of the surroundings, including vehicles, trees and buildings. \n\n\nThis is my first &quot;Game&quot; Torrent.
