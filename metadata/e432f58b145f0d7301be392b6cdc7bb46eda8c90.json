Recorded in Portland, Oregon, with producer Tucker Martine (My Morning Jacket, The Decemberists), the album bears the fruits of a period of introspection &amp; renewal: deeply lyrical songwriting, a newfound expressivity of voice, and, more than ever before, a daring synthesis of her broad musical influences into a powerfully individual artistic vision. \n\nI stretched myself as a singer on this record and used voices I never have before as a writer, she explains. A lot of the writing on this record happened in the dead of night, when spiders mend their webs, with an infant asleep in the next roomÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ as a result, my writing became a secret again: illicit and my own.
