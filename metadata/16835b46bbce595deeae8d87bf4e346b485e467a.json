The compilation 18 Essential Songs offers a wider selection, but does not include the original version of &quot;Me and Bobby McGee,&quot; which makes Greatest Hits the better purchase for those who only want one Janis Joplin disc, even if it isn't definitive. The 1999 CD reissue adds two bonus tracks, &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;Mercedes Benz.&quot; \n\nAmazon.com Review By Rickey Wright - More than Cheap Thrills or even Pearl, Greatest Hits has helped keep Janis Joplin's short-lived recording career alive for listeners who came along after her 1970 death. &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot; is the biggest draw, of course--it was a posthumous No. 1 single--but the rest is equally exciting. Despite the familiarity of the titles here, this goes far beyond the merely serviceable. Finally, the cover photo of Janis smiling in a sunny park is as poignant a shot of her as exists.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Piece Of My Heart\n[02] Summertime\n[03] Try (Just A Little Bit Harder)\n[04] Cry Baby\n[05] Me And Bobby McGee\n[06] Down On Me\n[07] Get It While You Can\n[08] Bye, Bye Baby\n[09] Move Over\n[10] Ball And Chain\n[11] Maybe\n[12] Mercedes Benz\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:47m:00s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 116mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Blues Rock\nRelease Date\t&gt; 31 August 1999\nRecord Company\t&gt; Sony Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.janisjoplin.com [Not Connecting]\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janis_Joplin \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/j/joplin.html \n\t&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Janis+Joplin \n\t&gt;[Cry Baby]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16835b46bbce595deeae8d87bf4e346b485e467a","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Janis+Joplin+116mb+%40320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16835b46bbce595deeae8d87bf4e346b485e467a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,131,91,70,187,206,89,93,238,174,141,135,191,78,52,107,72,94,70,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
