This was the missing piece of the puzzle for me, and may be for you too.\n\nSHIFT is more about how to actually learn pickup. Everything else focuses on what to do, but this is mainly focused on how you can get yourself into doing it. You may have spent years learning about pickup, but never taking any real action due to limiting beliefs about yourself and a lack of compelling motivation. This will change that and put you on an epic journey that that you'll be incredibly motivated to keep yourself motivated to stay on.\n\nSales page: http://makingashift.com/\n\n\nThis upload includes everything inside the top &quot;UNNATURAL&quot; package, neatly organized into the correct folders with proper file names. I've also included some great home made notes, found on reddit.\n\n---\nFeel free to donate to me if you want other uploads like this:\nBTC: 19WZf4bGMgKj2K5E6N5NaP1vpNgXJeuGpT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec0e7230468d162660221afe52c716157eb125b9","amp;dn":"RSD+Julien+-+SHIFT+%28%2B+all+infields+and+bonuses%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec0e7230468d162660221afe52c716157eb125b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,14,114,48,70,141,22,38,96,34,26,254,82,199,22,21,126,177,37,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
