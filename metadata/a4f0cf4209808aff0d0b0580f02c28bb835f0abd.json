Byrne and Eno worked on creating the album - a mix of electronic and Gospel music - throughout 2007 and early 2008 over e-mail and have used word-of-mouth and Internet sales to market the music. Byrne will tour for this album, performing songs from both this release and from the duo's previous collaborations, through late 2008 and early 2009.\n\nThe complete album, in pristine FLAC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f0cf4209808aff0d0b0580f02c28bb835f0abd","amp;dn":"David+Byrne%2C+Brian+Eno+Everything+That+Happens+Will+Happen+Today","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f0cf4209808aff0d0b0580f02c28bb835f0abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,240,207,66,9,128,138,255,13,11,5,128,240,44,40,187,131,95,10,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
