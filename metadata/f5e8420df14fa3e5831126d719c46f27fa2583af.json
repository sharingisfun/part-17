They weren't accomplished musicians -- Black Francis wailed and bashed out chords while Joey Santiago's lead guitar squealed out spirals of noise. But the bandmembers were inventive, rabid rock fans who turned conventions inside out, melding punk and indie guitar rock, classic pop, surf rock, and stadium-sized riffs with singer/guitarist Black Francis' bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture; while the meaning of his lyrics may have been impenetrable, the music was direct and forceful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e8420df14fa3e5831126d719c46f27fa2583af","amp;dn":"Pixies+-+Live+EP+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e8420df14fa3e5831126d719c46f27fa2583af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,232,66,13,241,79,163,229,131,17,38,215,25,196,111,39,250,37,131,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
