And everybody knows it, even if we can't all agree on what, specifically, \nthe problem is. Rising costs, changing climate, peaking oil, foreign oil, public safetyÃ¢â‚¬â€if the fears are this complicated, then the solutions are bound to be \neven more confusing. Maggie Koerth-BakerÃ¢â‚¬â€science editor at the award-winning blog BoingBoing.netÃ¢â‚¬â€finally makes some sense out of the madness. \nOver the next 20 years, we'll be forced to cut 20 quadrillion BTU worth of fossil fuels from our energy budget, by wasting less and investing in alternatives. \nTo make it work, we'll need to radically change the energy systems that have shaped our lives for 100 years. And the result will be neither business-as-usual,\n nor a hippie utopia. Koerth-Baker explains what we can do, what we can't do, and why &quot;The Solution&quot; is really a lot of solutions working together. \nThis isn't about planting a tree, buying a Prius, and proving that you're a good person. \nEconomics and social incentives got us a country full of gas-guzzling cars, long commutes, inefficient houses, and coal-fired power plants out in the \nmiddle of nowhere, and economics and incentives will be the things that build our new world. Ultimately, change is inevitable.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:400c2198a3c5ebcc111b6ce5c2cfb0f46e5e6ec7","amp;dn":"Before+the+Lights+Go+Out-+Conquering+the+Energy+Crisis+Before+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"400c2198a3c5ebcc111b6ce5c2cfb0f46e5e6ec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,12,33,152,163,197,235,204,17,27,108,229,194,207,176,244,110,94,110,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
