Billed as a musical autobiography, this double-CD companion to Clooney's written autobiography illustrates the stylized but varied and spunky career of the singer, from her earliest works to her most recent. Some of the highlights include &quot;Sooner or Later,&quot; Clooney's first solo performance from 1946, which features the sultry 17-year-old singer dueting with bandleader Tony Pastor; 1950's &quot;Peach Tree Street,&quot; with Clooney and Frank Sinatra collaborating for the first time; and on 1951's &quot;Come On-a My House&quot; we can hear the ultra-catchy, folksy tune that first brought Clooney acclaim (and the cover of Time), an astonishing triumph for a number she initially refused to sing. Fast-forward and we get even more gems (&quot;Hey There,&quot; &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover,&quot; to name just a few). Whether singing solo or with Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, or Duke Ellington, Clooney shines here--there aren't any duds in this collection. All in all, this is a great retrospective, with some numbers that even Clooney's longtime fans might not own. \n\n\n1. Sooner Or Later\n2. Bargain Day\n3. Peach Tree Street\n4.
