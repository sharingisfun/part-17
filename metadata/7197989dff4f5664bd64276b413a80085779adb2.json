Oh, he may win again but he wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get a majority. Oh, his trick bag is emptying fast, the ads are backfiring, the people are onto him, and soon his own party will turn on him. And let me tell you, it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t happen to a nicer guy. . . .\n\nDespite a constant barrage of outrage and disbelief from his detractors, Stephen Harper is on his way to becoming one of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most significant prime ministers. He has already been in power longer than Lester B. Pearson and John Diefenbaker. By 2015, and the end of this majority term, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have caught up to Brian Mulroney. \n\nNo matter the ups and downs, the triumphs and the self-inflicted wounds, Harper has been moving to build the Canada he wantsÃ¢â‚¬â€the Canada a significant proportion of Canadian voters want or they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have elected him three times. As Wells writes, &quot;He could not win elections without widespread support in the land. . . . Which suggests that Harper has what every successful federal leader has needed to survive over a long stretch of time: a superior understanding of Canada.&quot;\n\nIn The Longer IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Prime Minister, Paul Wells explores just what HarperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding of Canada is, and who he speaks for in the national conversation. He explains Harper not only to Harper supporters but also to readers who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe he is still CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prime minister. In this authoritative, engaging and sometimes deeply critical account of the man, Paul Wells also brings us an illuminating portrait of Canadian democracy: &quot;glorious, a little dented, and free.&quot;\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Politics | Cultural / Canada","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7197989dff4f5664bd64276b413a80085779adb2","amp;dn":"The+Longer+I%27m+Prime+Minister+by+Paul+Wells","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7197989dff4f5664bd64276b413a80085779adb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,151,152,157,255,79,86,100,189,100,39,107,65,58,128,8,87,121,173,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
