The static realization includes the cockpit ladder engine covers and pitot tags. The speedbrake is restricted to operate only with wheels up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just as in the real Hunter.\nThe simulation covers 7 unique variants and 8 texture sets including the Black Arrows, and the famous Swiss air force examples where the pilots were often part-time and the runways empty motorways!\nLooking into the cockpit the auto-animated avatar even has correct insignia on his arm patches.\nOnce started the high quality sound rendition of the Rolls Royce Avon is unmistakable. Starting produces exhaust smoke which settles to the turbine glow.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Going HuntingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\nInside the hunter, is a special place. No glass cockpit here, no fly-by-wire avionics or 'plastic' aeroplane. This is the real thing.\nBe it the 2D panels or the virtual cockpit the realistic dark military finish looks particularly purposeful but not intimidating. Perfectly simulated by AlphaSim, the Hawker's designers clearly thought about this panel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unlike perhaps those of Jaguar's E-type! Most of the systems will be very familiar to the general aviation pilot and in fact the Hunter is legal on a PPL.\nThe realistic all-xml 2D panel, custom pop-ups for autopilot, electrics and radios and in addition to the printed manual a PDF guide to all the features. Within the FS2004 variant the VC includes rain effects, in FSX night illumination of the gauges and with SP2, self shadowing.\nThe VC is fully authentic and includes many animations and 'mouseable' controls.\nSweep into the sky and the simulation matches the superb responsiveness of the real jet. The real Hunter just felt 'right' and the simulation feels authentically just so. This highly authentic replication, and comes complete with checklists to follow operational procedure.\nUsing the aircraft to high speed aerobatic advantage, the wing-tip vortices flicker with vapourÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nesigned for Flight Simulator, this multi-model package features the following;\n\n\nLionheart Creations - Junkers W Series build 1.04\n\nAircraft 'Models' in this package;\n*  Junkers W33L inline J5 powered Cargo Plane\n*  Famous 'Bremen' model that made the European Atlantic crossing\n*  Famous 'Bremen' model with Ski's attached\n*  Famous 'Bremen' model with pontoons for water landings\n*  Junkers W33L Passenger Model with high detail interior and passengers\n*  Junkers W33L Cargo Plane\n*  Junkers W33L Float Plane with Passenger Interior\n*  Junkers W33L Float Plane with Cargo Interior\n*  Junkers W33L Passenger model ski plane\n*  Junkers W33L Cargo ski plane\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant cargo plane\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant passenger plane\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant cargo floatplane\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant passenger floatplane\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant cargo with ski's\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant passenger with ski's.\n*  Junkers W34 Radial powered BMW Wasp variant with wheel skirts\n\nFeatures;\n*  Two high detail virtual cockpits (2 variants)\n*  High detail passenger liner with detailed, animated passengers\n*  All vent windows, door, inner hatch, and overhead slider panels in VC are animated\n*  High detail exterior paint schemes in several vintage liveries\n*  Fully animated controls, levers, and buttons in the Virtual Cockpit\n*  High realism airfile that features the unique feel of the wide wingspan all metal classic\nairliner.\n*  Appearing wheel chauks and vintage European cargo baggage carriage\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fba887271fb3ee4b25dbf3a7c658ed5b0d6c332","amp;dn":"fsx+Hawker+Hunter+and+Junkers+W+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fba887271fb3ee4b25dbf3a7c658ed5b0d6c332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,186,136,114,113,251,62,228,178,93,191,58,124,101,142,213,176,214,195,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
