River-by-river, we explore six of the world's most iconic watercourses, tracing their routes, their histories and their changing lives, telling the compelling stories of the life that's lived along their banks. We encounter indigenous communities who dwell in harmony with rivers; modern traders, artists and artisans who make their living there; and vast metropolises which - now more than ever - depend on 21st century technologies to keep the ancient waters at bay.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Ganges \nThe Ganges is the most spiritually revered river on Earth. For Hindus, Mother Ganga is a sacred spirit to be worshipped. It rises in an ice-cave in the Himalayas and empties into the Bay of Bengal. The holy river is a source of cleansing for sins, a place of purification. But the Ganges has become so badly polluted that it is dangerous to bathe in it let alone to drink from it.\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2100 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 48.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges_River&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges_River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangtze_River&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17acac00527b692c14510feec7b4fadc52d1ef5f","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Rivers+And+Life+3of6+The+Ganges+PDTV+XviD+AC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17acac00527b692c14510feec7b4fadc52d1ef5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,172,172,0,82,123,105,44,20,81,15,238,199,180,250,220,82,209,239,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
