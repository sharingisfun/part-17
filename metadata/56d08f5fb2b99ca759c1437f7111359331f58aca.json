Extensively used in World War I, the M1903 Springfield saw widespread combat in World War II and Korea. During World War I, US troops developed a formidable reputation for marksmanship aided by the accuracy of the M1903 Springfield. World War II saw the introduction of the M1903A3, which changed the rear sight so that it was closer to that of the M1 Garand, to allow easier training of troops who might be issued either rifle. Illustrated with specially commissioned color artwork and drawing upon veteransÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ recollections, this is the engaging story of the M1903 Springfield, an iconic rifle prized for its lethal accuracy that equipped US and other troops for much of the 20th century.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-M1903-Springfield-Rifle-Weapon/dp/1780960115&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-M1903-Springfield-Rifle-Weapon/dp/1780960115&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56d08f5fb2b99ca759c1437f7111359331f58aca","amp;dn":"The+M1903+Springfield+Rifle+%28Osprey+Weapon+23%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56d08f5fb2b99ca759c1437f7111359331f58aca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,208,143,95,178,185,156,167,89,193,67,127,113,17,53,147,49,245,138,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
