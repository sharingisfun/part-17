The science of information is explained in detail, with many striking examples to clarify fundamental questions, such as: What are the laws of information? How did language develop? Is artificial intelligence possible?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uses logic and scientific evidence to effectively demonstrate the necessity of a Creator.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wonderful illustrations define the material effectively.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Focuses on Dr. GittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s specialty Ã¢â‚¬â€ information. Information Ã¢â‚¬â€ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one of the most fundamental parts of our world, yet we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t often think about it.\n\nThis classic book, now being published by Master Books, demonstrates the importance of information to life of any kind. More to the point, it demonstrates the necessity of an Organizer and Originator of the information necessary for life. Dr. Gitt argues that God is not bound by the laws of nature, but instead uses them for His own purposes. He also shows that the highly complex information present in DNA mitigates a non-intelligent beginning for life. He advocates for assurance when dealing with the BibleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s information, that this collection of books is not only free of error, but that no useless information is present, as well.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nWerner Gitt, with a doctorate in engineering, has been a professor at the Federal Physics-Technology Institute in Braunschweig, Germany, since 1971. He has written numerous scientific papers as well as several popular books for the lay reader, and is a guest lecturer on the subject of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bible and ScienceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Basel, Switzerland.
