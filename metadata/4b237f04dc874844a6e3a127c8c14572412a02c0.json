In the Mississippi countryside, a friendship between a middle-aged, alcoholic contractor and an abused teen-aged boy becomes a bizarre rite of passage for both of them. The characters are riveting, and the conclusion is shocking in this latest work by a major talent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b237f04dc874844a6e3a127c8c14572412a02c0","amp;dn":"Larry+Brown-Joe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b237f04dc874844a6e3a127c8c14572412a02c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,35,127,4,220,135,72,68,166,227,161,39,200,193,69,114,65,42,2,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
