It includes chapters on cameras, lenses, studio set-ups and an in-depth explanation of the latest digital technologies and an ordered, sensible approach to digital workflow. I found the book to be complete, very informative and concise and I appreciated the fact that the author looked at close-up and macro photography as both an art and a science. Highly recommended.&quot; - Harold Naideau, professional photographer, educator and president of the Long Island chapter of the American Society of Media Photographers\n\n &quot;Close-up and Macro Photography is one of the most comprehensible books on macro photography I have ever read. An un-missable resource for the experienced or amateur macro photographer.&quot; - Hugh Leslie, Macrophotography.org\nProduct Description\n In this exhaustive guide to macro photography, respected author and photographer Adrian Davies takes a comprehensive approach to the subject, covering every aspect of the multi-faceted and often complicated world of close-up photography. \n\nEverything about Adrian's approach is both practical and diverse, with optimal output always in mind. His coverage of equipment, for example, goes beyond cameras to cover the application of flatbed and film scanners for close-up shots (2D, 3D, reflective and translucent subjects). \n\nSeperate sections cover cameras and equipment, lenses, lighting, workflow and image processing. Additionally, a seperate section on 'special subjects' covers techniques for shooting both common macro subjects (including insects, fossils and coins), as well as a range of technical elements such as shiny surfaces, texture, and polarised light. The appendix includes a technical discussion on depth of field, including detailed tables, and a range of optical formulae. \n\nClear, concise and comprehensive, and packed with stunning images, this is a must-have purchase for all photographers looking for professional quality macro results. \n\n* One-stop guide to all things macro by respected author/photographer Adrian Davies\n* Takes a comprehensive approach to a macro workflow, covering every aspect from pre-capture (including selecting equipment from compacts to film scaners) through to post-capture and image processing\n* Packed with stunning macro photographs to inspire the reader and put the information in a practical context\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7524265b4902517888a46b2da4d9942221b9e6f0","amp;dn":"Getting+Started+with+Digital+Imaging+%2B101+Quick+and+Easy+Secrets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7524265b4902517888a46b2da4d9942221b9e6f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,36,38,91,73,2,81,120,136,164,107,45,164,217,148,34,33,185,230,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
