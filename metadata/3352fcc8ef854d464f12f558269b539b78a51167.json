BEST EVAR]\n========================================================\n\n\nWhat does Nose Hair Edition Mean?......................:\n\nGet out your epic sax gentleman!  In this version you can see Howard's nose hairs clearly.  It's also called Nose Hair edition because if you pause the video and put your nose up to your TV, you can spot a few extra creases in the blue curtains.\n\nIt might only be discernible to an expert videophile's trained eye!  But don't worry!  If you schedule an appointment with your eye doctor and obtain 20/20 vision, you too can unlock the virtues of obsessive compulsive disorder!\n\nDon't disappoint those imaginary friends you invite over your house with a Birthday Bash that doesn't display crystal clear nose hairs.  They will immediately abandon you as a friend and call you a loser.\n.......................................................:\n\n\n\nFile Info..............................................:\n\nLength: 03:58:11\nSize: 7.35GB\nResolution: 1920x1080p\nVideo: 4112kbps H.264 MP4\nAudio: 125kbps 48kHz AAC\n\nLineage: \nNo compression/encoding.
