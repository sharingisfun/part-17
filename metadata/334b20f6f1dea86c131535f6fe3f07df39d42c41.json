Kshirsagar  (Author), Deepak Chopra M.D. (Foreword), Kristin Loberg (Contributor)\r\n\r\nProduct Details\r\nHardcover: 304 pages\r\nPublisher: Atria Books; 1 edition (August 26, 2014)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1476734801\r\nISBN-13: 978-1476734804\r\n\r\nFrom an internationally recognized physician who combines Eastern and Western medicine, a groundbreaking diet and total body health plan centered on digestive balance and metabolic transformation.\r\n\r\nThe complaints that Dr. Suhas hears on a daily basis, from body weight chaos, low energy, and poor sleep, to headaches, unexplained congestion, and depression, all have a surprising common denominator: a weak digestive â€œfire.â€ Drawing on ancient Indian practices and principles, The Hot Belly Diet shows you how to optimize your digestive powers to foster rapid weight loss and vibrant health.\r\n\r\nAt the core of this three-phase diet that makes lunch the most important meal of the day is a dish called khichadi (pronounced kitch-a-de)â€”a complete but incredibly easy-to-make meal that helps clear out your â€œama,â€ or the digestive sludge that antagonizes weight loss, provokes hormonal imbalances, and ultimately triggers inflammationâ€”the root cause of virtually all disease. This unique book also explains incompatible foods (milk and eggs, for example), why the sensation of hunger is essential, and how to time your meals throughout the day without snacking. The Hot Belly Diet changes your relationship with food to make healthy eatingâ€”and livingâ€”effortless.\r\n\r\nWhether youâ€™re suffering from a chronic condition, looking to prevent future illness, or just want to feel your best every day, The Hot Belly Diet will re-establish your bodyâ€™s natural balance, creating a thinner, healthier, and happier you.\r\n\r\nBTC - 1CZ4nTozpgfgqufWhiXDtBu9pVurd41SPz\r\n\r\nenjoy...\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n.:.Shailab.:.\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/shailab/\r\n \nhttps://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334b20f6f1dea86c131535f6fe3f07df39d42c41","amp;dn":"The+Hot+Belly+Diet+-+Suhas+G.+Kshirsagar+1476734801+%28Shailab%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334b20f6f1dea86c131535f6fe3f07df39d42c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,75,32,246,241,222,168,108,19,21,53,246,254,63,7,223,57,212,44,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
