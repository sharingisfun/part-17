Forget and move on. But how do you forget something that has stained your soul and forces you to lie to your loved ones? Even if your intentions are to spare them the horrors of the truth? \n\nLuke knows Olivia is not as recovered as she would have him believe. He can see the pain she tries to keep hidden behind her eyes, and knows she has not told him everything. But how do you save someone who wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let you in? Where shame holds Olivia captive, Luke suffers through the guilt of not protecting the one person he loves more than anything. \n\nCan two people who have suffered so dearly find a way to come together or will they risk the dreams they have placed in each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hearts? Can love find a way where forgiveness cannot?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:533ded8f267c3de7f81fe8dcc1bfbea0950bd42a","amp;dn":"Pretty+Little+Dreams+%28Pretty+Little+Lies+%232%29+by+Jennifer+Miller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"533ded8f267c3de7f81fe8dcc1bfbea0950bd42a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,61,237,143,38,124,61,231,248,31,232,220,193,191,190,160,149,11,212,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
