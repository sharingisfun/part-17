Her operatically-trained, five-octave instrument was the very model of beauty and control. Consequently, her signature tune, &quot;Lovin' You,&quot; is likely the breeziest bit of pop you may ever hear. In addition to her own songs, Riperton also makes light work of material as lovely and strong as Stevie Wonder's &quot;Perfect Angel&quot; and Joni Mitchell's &quot;Woman of Heart and Mind.&quot; The only misstep on this collection, in fact, is yet another unnecessary take of The Doors' &quot;Light My Fire.&quot; --Michael Ruby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66516e480efcd1d418286c6dd874a0a669cfefe6","amp;dn":"Minnie+Riperton+-+The+Best+of+Minnie+Riperton+%281993%29+-+Highest+Q","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66516e480efcd1d418286c6dd874a0a669cfefe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,81,110,72,14,252,209,212,24,40,108,109,216,116,160,166,105,207,239,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
