With vocalist Don Dokken's captivating stage presence and guitarist George Lynch's high-energy style, the band combined rockers such as &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; and power ballads such as &quot;Alone Again&quot; in order to create a number of best-selling albums.\n\nDokken's roots date back to the late '70s, when Lynch, along with drummer Mick Brown, teamed up with Don Dokken to form the Boyz. In 1981, Don moved to Germany and was signed to Carerre Records. The band, now simply known as Dokken, recorded and released Breaking the Chains, their first studio album, in 1983. While the record failed to retain a decent chart position in the United States, the group was immensely popular in Europe.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\n01.Breaking The Chains\n02.Paris Is Burning (Live)\n03.Into The Fire\n04.Just Got Lucky\n05.Alone Again\n06.Tooth And Nail\n07.The Hunter\n08.In My Dreams\n09.It's Not Love\n10.Dream Warriors\n11.Burning Like A Flame\n12.Heaven Sent\n13.Mr. Scary\n14.Walk Away\n15.Mirror Mirror\n16.Too High To Fly\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43aef1d89f1acd5ef1badcf0418767a3053e27ae","amp;dn":"Dokken+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%281999%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43aef1d89f1acd5ef1badcf0418767a3053e27ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,174,241,216,159,26,205,94,241,186,220,240,65,135,103,163,5,62,39,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
