This tie-in novel to Fox's groundbreaking TV show 24 answers the question of what happened to CTU agent Jack Bauer after the thrilling final moments of the last season.\n\nThe time is 5:00 PM.\n\nOne hour ago, federal agent Jack Bauer was declared a fugitive. If he wants to survive, he must get out of the country, and he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much time.\n\nWith his former colleagues in the Counter Terrorist Unit now dead, under arrest, or shut down, Jack has no resources to call upon, no back-up, and nowhere to goÃ¢â‚¬â€only his determination can drive him on. One thing remains clear to him: the promise he made to his daughter Kim. Jack vows that he will see Kim one last time to tell her he loves herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦before he drops off the radar forever.\n\nMeanwhile, a hastily-assembled FBI task force set out to track down and capture Jack, even as a covert operations unit of RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SVR set out to do the sameÃ¢â‚¬â€only the remit of the Russians is to kill on sight. As the clock runs down, Jack must face old friends and past enemies in a desperate race to stay one step ahead of the hunters, leaving them with a grim warningÃ¢â‚¬â€\n\nStay out of my way, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be gone within 24 hours. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll never see me again. Come after me...and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll regret it.\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJAMES SWALLOW is the New York Times bestselling author of more than thirty-five books, including fiction from the worlds of Star Trek, Doctor Who, and more.
