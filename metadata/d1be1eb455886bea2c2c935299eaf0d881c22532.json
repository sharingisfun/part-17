His innovations also \nincluded the use of harmonics. Pastorius suffered from mental illness including a \nsubstance-related disorder, and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982. He died \nin 1987 at age 35 following a violent altercation at a Fort Lauderdale bar.\n\nPastorius was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 1988, one of only six \nbassists to be so honored (and the only electric bass guitarist). He is one of the most \ninfluential electric bass players of all time.\n\n\n[color=#000066]\n   1. Jaco Pastorius - Donna Lee                              [02:27]\n   2.
