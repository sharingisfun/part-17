Since it is quite big I will not keep it on on computer and will seed it here so all clients can download them later for free (as they are entitled to). \n\nThis is the AOA 737 Training content, made mainly for the PMDG 737 NGX series, including GroundWork, FlightWork, and LineWork (the initial 6 lessons). \n\nIt contains everything, all lessons on the website, both the HD and the mobile versions, the study guides, the scrips and any additional files that may have been created for this. \n\nThis has been shared only for clients that don't want to pay the stupid Unlock Downloads fee (we already paid once Chris)!\n\n-xT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb24abc50308db4d40c8910191038f28f4b46ca","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Angle+of+Attack+737+Training+%28GroundWork%2C+FlightWork%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb24abc50308db4d40c8910191038f28f4b46ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,178,74,188,80,48,141,180,212,12,137,16,25,16,56,242,143,75,70,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
