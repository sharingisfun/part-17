Fortunately, it is also easy to learn, as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see in this workshop from web developer and trainer Joe Chellman. After a quick exploration of the basics, Joe walks you through a series of real-world examples that show how JavaScript is used in actual web pages to create interactivity, move data between web applications, power mobile apps, and more. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also be introduced to jQuery, a hugely popular programming framework that adds some great features to JavaScript, and get tips on avoiding common coding problems. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been an easier way to get started programming with JavaScript.\n\nContents :\n\nIntroduction to JavaScript\n   What Is JavaScript?
