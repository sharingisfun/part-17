Visualizing the Revolution surveys the rich and multifaceted visual culture of the French Revolution, exploring its creation and how it conveyed the new revolutionary sensibilities of the era.            Unlike most studies on art of the French Revolution, Visualizing the Revolution embraces a wide range of artistic genresÃ¢â‚¬â€including prints, architecture, painting, and sculptureÃ¢â‚¬â€and also draws upon archival documents to investigate the periodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aesthetic concerns. The authors break new ground in methodology and interpretative practice as they tease out the web of connections between these various historical artifacts and argue for the central place of the arts in the transmission of ideas and the political manipulation of the populace. The book translates the provocatively new visual language revealed in these artworks and writings and shows how its emphasis on metaphor, allegory, and symbolism transformed French mass visual culture.  An innovative and lushly illustrated study, Visualizing the Revolution is a worthy new contribution to scholarship on the French Revolution and the history of French art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3743ef46c7d858c6881675274f206b5562e20a9d","amp;dn":"Visualizing+the+Revolution+-+Politics+and+Pictorial+Arts+in+Late","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3743ef46c7d858c6881675274f206b5562e20a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,67,239,70,199,216,88,198,136,22,117,39,79,32,107,85,98,226,10,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
