This leads to ongoing confusion about what she does and for whom, exacerbated by subsequent episodes of amnesia. Although she becomes aware that she is intended as an assassin, she finds the idea increasingly distasteful and experiences dreams and desires like a human. This begins to undermine her morale but not her efficiency, for her conditioning takes over as her masters or survival circumstances require. When she seeks out clues to her past and true identity, she stumbles onto a conspiracy involving a secret society of cyborgs attempting to undermine the legitimate government.\n\nWritten by David Wohl (The Darkness, Witchblade) and drawn by comic book artist David Finch (Cyberforce, Moon Knight).\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d67c6bdcd6a14c74b79cd78b3a9d51465f6d78","amp;dn":"Aphrodite+IX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d67c6bdcd6a14c74b79cd78b3a9d51465f6d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,214,124,107,220,214,161,76,116,183,156,215,139,58,157,81,70,95,109,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
