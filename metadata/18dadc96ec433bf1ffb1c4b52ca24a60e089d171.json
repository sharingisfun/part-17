While he does perform and record serious songs, he is most famous for his comedic ones, especially:\n\nThe three minute Hamlet\nFishing for Chickens\nArmed Forces Tribute (play this for servicemen (they'll piss themselves dry)\nOld MacDonald's deformed farm, and\nMonkey Farts\n\nHe has released several albums, of which I have two commercial ones. I also have several bootlegs and mixed quality mp3s I got from WinMX and other P2P services. Some of these are of decent to poor quality. Don't leave comments telling me that, I already know. I am hoping that someone else will see this torrent and decide to up all the other commercial albums. This is seriously funny stuff. \n\nAmerican downloaders - Check his website to see when he will next perform in your area. I promise that this guy will not disappoint if you go to see him live. One warning - he really hates Yankee fans.\n\nSeamus' website - http://www.mcnote.com/seamus/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18dadc96ec433bf1ffb1c4b52ca24a60e089d171","amp;dn":"Seamus+Kennedy+-+Comic+Irish+Drinking+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18dadc96ec433bf1ffb1c4b52ca24a60e089d171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,218,220,150,236,67,59,241,255,177,196,181,44,162,74,96,224,137,209,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
