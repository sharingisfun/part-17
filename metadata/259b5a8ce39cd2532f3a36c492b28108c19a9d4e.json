She is the great-niece of legendary singer/actress Ethel Waters.\n\nCareer\n\nWaters enjoyed three major popÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“dance hits in the early/mid '90s: &quot;Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)&quot; (1991), &quot;100% Pure Love&quot; (1994) and &quot;Say... If You Feel Alright&quot; (1997).\n\nShe is also the singer in &quot;Destination Calabria&quot;, a 2007 hit release by Alex Gaudino, a mashup which uses vocals from her 2004 &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; and instrumental from Rune RK's 2003 &quot;Calabria&quot;.\n\nWaters lived in New Jersey, but later moved to Washington, D.C., to study computer science at Howard University\n. After graduation, she worked as a computer technician at the Washington, D.C., Parole Board[1]. She took her demo tape of &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; to a Music Business Forum, and the only people to call her about it were a trio of club disc jockeys\nwho formed the Basement Boys.\n\n&quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; became a worldwide hit, memorable for its la da dee la dee da refrain and its often sampled keyboard riff. The track reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and found even more success in Europe, reaching #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The track was also parodied in the memorable sketch &quot;My Songs Are Mindless&quot; (Performed by Kim Wayans) on the television series In Living Color in 1991. Wayans skewered the song's simple rhythm and melody by singing &quot;Hey look at that it's Fred and the Flintstones! That's a song now, I got a song now: Yabba Dabba Doo Yabba Dabba Da, Yabba Dabba Doo Yabba Dabba Da....&quot; The clip from the comedy show would sometimes show up mixed into Waters' own composition at Gay clubs with video screens. Scarcely a year after its release, a new version turned up on the Red Hot + Dance AIDS fundraiser disc (1992, distributed by Sony Music), gaining its remixer (Joey Negro) his first real American exposure.\n\nDespite some additional contributions by remixer Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley, Waters' next releases were promoted only in the dance music markets, but she made an unexpected mainstream comeback in 1994 when &quot;100% Pure Love&quot; hit #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the longest charting singles on the Hot 100 at 45 weeks (&quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; remained on the chart for an average 16 weeks).\n\nHer 1997, self-titled album included another Top 40 US hit, &quot;Say...If You Feel Alright,&quot; but mainstream success in the US has since eluded her. However, Waters remains successful on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and the Hot Dance Airplay charts with recent hits like &quot;Come On Down&quot; and &quot;My Time,&quot; both of which peaked at #1, the latter making top 40 in the UK. &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot;'s keyboard-chord was recently sampled on rapper T.I.'s 2006 mega-hit &quot;Why You Wanna.&quot;\n\nIn 2007 Waters embarked on a world tour; performing sold out shows in Russia, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico, and Dubai, among other locations. In 2007 her track &quot;Destination Calabria&quot; hit the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn May 2008, Waters issued the single &quot;Dancefloor&quot;, giving Waters yet another Top 10 Dance hit. &quot;Never Enough&quot; hit #20 on the US Dance Charts in February 2009.\n\nDestination Calabria\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDestination CalabriaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSingle by Alex Gaudino featuring Crystal Waters\nReleased 4 December 2006 (Italy)\n19 March 2007 (World)\nFormat CD, 12&quot; and digital download\nRecorded 2006\nGenre Club House\nLength 6:56 (original mix)\n3:03 (UK radio edit)\n3:40 (original radio edit)\nLabel Rise Records\nWriter(s) Alessandro Fortunato Gaudino, Rune Reilly KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸lsch, Stefano Scarpellini, Sharon May Linn\nProducer Alex Gaudino, Maurizio Nari, Ronnie Milani\nAlex Gaudino featuring Crystal Waters singles chronology\nBittersweet Melody\n(2005) &quot;Destination Calabria&quot;\n(2007) Que Pasa Contigo\n(2007)\nAlternate cover\nFrench cover\nFrench cover\n\n&quot;Destination Calabria&quot; is a DJ track by Italian producer Alex Gaudino, with vocals by Crystal Waters.\n\nThe track is a mashup, taking the instrumental from Rune's &quot;Calabria&quot; and the vocals from Alex Gaudino's and Crystal Waters' &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;, both originally released in 2003.
