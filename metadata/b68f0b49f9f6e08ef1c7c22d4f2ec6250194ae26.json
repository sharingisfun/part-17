She is the only female artist who has had a UK Top 20 hit in every one of the last five decades.\r\nIt's been over 50 years since her first public performance as a schoolgirl in Scotland, named Marie McDonald McLaughlin Lawrie. Since then, she's notched up 66 singles and 21 albums. She's enjoyed No.1 hits on both sides of the Atlantic, and also won a Eurovision Song Contest.\r\nHere, Lulu opens the doors to her life - looking back across five decades at her remarkable career. This is also very much the story of Lulu now - following her into the studio with Jools Holland; rehearsing for shows; choreographing new dance routines; and exclusive access as Lulu prepares and performs for a huge concert on the banks of the River Clyde in her old home town of Glasgow.\r\nThis fascinating story of an unparalleled life in show business features contributions from Elton John, Kylie Minogue, Cliff Richard, Robin Gibb, Barry Manilow, Bobby Womack and Jools Holland, along with family members, such as Lulu's brother and sister.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7c/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3f/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/08/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/Lulu-Something-to-Shout-about-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~2658Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~127Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 88 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.73 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0169l59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68f0b49f9f6e08ef1c7c22d4f2ec6250194ae26","amp;dn":"BBC+Lulu+Something+to+Shout+About+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68f0b49f9f6e08ef1c7c22d4f2ec6250194ae26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,143,11,73,249,246,224,142,241,199,194,45,79,46,198,37,1,148,174,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
