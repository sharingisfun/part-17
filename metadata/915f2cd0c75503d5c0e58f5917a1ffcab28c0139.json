The screenplay does have some good lines ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including an amusingly protracted stagecoach conversation (supposedly in French) between the two stars which actually incorporates slangy English, French, Italian, Spanish and some Latin, too ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but the plot is rather too thin to sustain the film&amp;#039;s length. Hawn is a saloon entertainer/hooker with ideas above her station: she gets to wear tarty outfits, sing a bawdy song in an English accent and board the aforementioned stagecoach to become &quot;The Duchess&quot; of the title, an English governess to a host of kids borne by a wealthy Mormon; on the other hand, Segal is a luckless womanizing cardsharp who keeps getting caught cheating and finding himself at the wrong end of the noose; he eventually manages to abscond with $40,000 in stolen loot to the eternal chagrin of a ramshackle band of outlaws. The bag containing the money changes owners more often than these characters take a bath and, along the way, Hawn and Segal finally make love aboard a canoe approaching some deadly rapids, take refuge in a Jewish wedding ceremony and are bound together and left to roast under the baking desert sun. The change in mood towards the end ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where Segal is repeatedly shot in the final confrontation with the gang ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is far from smoothly handled but the open-ended conclusion nevertheless manages to end the film on a lighter note.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_and_the_Dirtwater_Fox&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_and_the_Dirtwater_Fox&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tGeorge Segal as Charlie &quot;Dirtwater Fox&quot; Malloy \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tGoldie Hawn as Amanda &quot;Duchess&quot; Quaid \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tConrad Janis as Gladstone \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tThayer David as Josiah Widdicombe \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tJennifer Lee as Trollop \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tSid Gould as Rabbi \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tPat Ast as Music hall singer \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tE.
