They are introduced to six year old Vanya, who they warm to quickly and offer to take him back to Italy. The other boys envy Vanya, but he begins to have doubts when another mother comes to reclaim her son, and is determined to find his own birth mother.\n\nHe leaves the orphanage with an older girl working there as a prostitute and the address of his previous children&amp;#039;s home, hoping to find further details of his mother there. He ends up boarding the train alone and catches a bus to the children&amp;#039;s home, whilst being followed by &quot;Madame&quot;, who needs Vanya for the Italians&amp;#039; money, and her driver. He speaks to the head of the children&amp;#039;s home and sets off with his mother&amp;#039;s address. He bumps into the driver, who, after a fight in the rain, decides to let him go and meet his mother. The film ends with Vanya narrating a letter to his friend Anton, who was adopted by the Italian couple instead.\n\nKolya Spiridonov Vanya Solntsev \nYuri Itskov Headmaster \nMariya Kuznetsova &quot;Madame&quot; \nDenis Moiseenko Kolyan \nNikolai Reutov Gregori \nVladimir Shipov Bloke \nOlga Shuvalova Irka \nSasha Sirotkin Sery \nPolina Vorobieva Nataha \nAndrei Yelizarov Timokha \nDima Zemlyanko Anton \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fbf8e99c0d5ba29c72769efc74adb6c1dcc2121","amp;dn":"The.Italian.DVDrip+IJOY+%2B+Eng+Sub+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fbf8e99c0d5ba29c72769efc74adb6c1dcc2121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,191,142,153,192,213,186,41,199,39,105,239,199,74,219,108,29,204,33,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
