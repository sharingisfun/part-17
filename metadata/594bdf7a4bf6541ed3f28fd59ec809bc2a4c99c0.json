Wayne Nafziger updates the economic development of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and East-Central Europe in this fourth edition. Nafziger explains the reasons for the fast growth of Pacific Rim countries, Brazil, Poland, and (recently) India, and the increasing economic misery and degradation of large parts of sub-Saharan Africa. He also examines China and other post-socialist economies as low- and middle-income countries, without, however, overshadowing a primary focus on the third world. Nafziger's text is filled with real-world examples--emphasizing the themes of poverty, inequality, unemployment, the environment, and deficiencies of people in less developed countries.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 868 pages\n    * Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 4 edition (December 27, 2005)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0521829666\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0521829663","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594bdf7a4bf6541ed3f28fd59ec809bc2a4c99c0","amp;dn":"Economic+Development+%2C+4th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594bdf7a4bf6541ed3f28fd59ec809bc2a4c99c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,75,223,122,75,246,84,30,211,242,143,213,158,200,9,188,42,76,153,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
