Among them, KISS guitarist Ace Frehley's earliest known major label recordings as part of shelved psychadelic/prog-rock outfit Molimo.\n\nRecorded for RCA in 1971, the record's existence has been the source of much speculation for KISS over the years, but when a quest to find it in RCA's vaults proved unfruitful, hope seemed lost. Reisman's find is the single biggest &quot;lost&quot; music discovery since the Velvet Underground 1966 acetate was found by collector Warren Hill at a Portland garage sale in 2004.\n\nThe RCA Vaults were searched for this years ago, and it was documented they didn't turn anything up. After Ace Frehley left Molimo and went to Casablanca Records to record with KISS, he brought his old band members [from Molimo] with him to record an album. \nThe band's called Tomorrow Morning. That's another acetate that was found inside that same batch. They recorded an album that never came out.\n\nVillage Voice April 18, 2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83912fe595336e8786fb0af843ba8b3749624c81","amp;dn":"Molimo+-+Ace+Frehley+band+before+KISS+-+demo+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83912fe595336e8786fb0af843ba8b3749624c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,145,47,229,149,51,110,135,134,251,10,248,67,186,139,55,73,98,76,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
