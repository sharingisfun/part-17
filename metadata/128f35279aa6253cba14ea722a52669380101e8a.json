It achieves this through the use of sounds, recorded during post-production, to emphasize the car's bodily functions and movements. The protagonist Bimal can be seen as an influence on the cynical cab driver Narasingh (played by Soumitra Chatterjee) in Satyajit Ray's Abhijan (1962), which in turn served as a prototype for the character of Travis Bickle (played by Robert De Niro) in Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976).\n\nThe film was considered for a special entry in the Venice Film Festival in 1959.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Kali Bannerjee as Bimal\n    Chevrolet (1920 Model) as Jagaddal\n    Gangapada Basu as Uncle\n    Satindra Bhattacharya\n    Tulsi Chakraborty\n    Anil Chatterjee as Bride groom\n    Shriman Deepak as noy\n    Kajal Gupta as Young woman\n    Gyanesh Mukherjee as Mechanic\n    Keshto Mukherjee as Lunatic\n    Sita Mukherjee as Bulaki\n\nDirected by Ritwik Ghatak\nWritten by Subodh Ghosh (short story), Ritwik Ghatak (story elaboration)\nMusic by Ali Akbar Khan\nRunning time 104 min.\n\nMOVIE PLOT:- Ajantrik (1958)\nBimal is a taxi-driver in a small provincial town. He lives alone, his taxi (an old 1920 Chevrolet jalopy which he named Jagaddal) is his only companion and, although very battered, it is the apple of Bimal's eye. The film shows episodes from his life in the industrial wasteland, delivering people from one place to another.\n\nGeorges Sadoul, the well-known film critic shared his experience of watching the film in this way. He said, &quot;What does 'Ajantrik' mean? I don't know and I believe no one in Venice Film Festival knew...I can't tell the whole story of the film...there was no subtitle for the film. But I saw the film spellbound till the very end&quot;. According to the noted Bengali poet and German scholar Alokranjan Dasgupta, &quot;The merciless conflict of ethereal nature and mechanised civilization,through the love of taxi driver Bimal and his pathetic vehicle Jagaddal seems to be a unique gift of...modernism.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 1119 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x288\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Bengali\nRunTime: 98 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: About 98 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128f35279aa6253cba14ea722a52669380101e8a","amp;dn":"Ajantrik+%281958%29+Bengali+VCD+-+No+Subs+-+Kali+Banerjee+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128f35279aa6253cba14ea722a52669380101e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,143,53,39,154,166,37,60,186,20,234,114,42,82,102,147,128,16,30,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
