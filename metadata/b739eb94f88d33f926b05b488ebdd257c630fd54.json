Somewhat snowy, shot from the side, this \r\nis a very entertaining concert for fans of YesWest.\r\n\r\nMyself, I'm a fan of audience shot videos - I've shot 40 or so myself, and have 100s of old VHS tapes from collectors around the world. I really enjoy this video, but, your enjoyment will likely be determined by how much you tolerate somewhat shaky, somewhat blurry and generated picture. If you're cool with that, and you enjoy this somewhat controversial era of Yes, then this might be something you'll enjoy!
