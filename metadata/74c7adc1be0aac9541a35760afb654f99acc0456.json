Directed by Erlend Gjertsen, the film was issued on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in November 2011[1] via Jester Records and Kscope. The film documents Ulverâ€™s performance at The Norwegian National Opera on 31 July 2010. The concert was later issued as a CD/DVD set, and double LP. The film holds an 18 rating from the BBFC for containing strong sex and bloody images,[2] however, no cuts were made to the performance.[3]\r\n\r\nThe concert also included performances from artist Ian Johnstone, â€œwelcoming everyone as Mr. Ark Todd in a static dance under a levitating moon, and parting with a pillar, on the skeleton legs of a horse, pale and naked as nature intended. The two pieces were accompanied by piano prepared by Daniel and the sound of a sleeping beast from Kris' pad.â€[4]\r\n\r\nUntil recently Ulver had remained exclusively within the studio. This changed in May 2009 when the band accepted an invitation to appear at the Norwegian Festival of Literature.[5] The success of this gig lead to them embarking on a string of other live performances in 2009 and 2010, selling out prestigious venues such as the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, VolksbÃ¼hne in Berlin and La Cigale in Paris before they returned to their homeland for their performance at The Norwegian Opera House.[6][7]\r\n\r\nUlver were the first band outside the established Norwegian music scene to be invited to play at the Opera House.\r\n\r\nOn 9 September 2011 a trailer was released by Kscope.[8]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c7adc1be0aac9541a35760afb654f99acc0456","amp;dn":"Ulver+-+The+Norwegian+National+Opera+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c7adc1be0aac9541a35760afb654f99acc0456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,199,173,193,190,10,172,149,65,163,87,96,175,182,84,249,154,204,4,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
