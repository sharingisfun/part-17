With these songs I wrote the initial music, with KOD guitarist Julian Swales\n shaping them, suggesting tempo changes, structure changes, and providing the trademark sonic embellishments \nof his galactic guitar cascades. Dan Goodwin, original KOD drummer, added percussion and rhythm programming support.\n They were recorded in my studio in Derbyshire and at Julian's studio in Brighton. The songs were mixed with\n Pascal Gabriel in April 2013 when I was recovering from a nephrectomy and winter would not leave us.\n\n==============================\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
