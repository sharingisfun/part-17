Their wives, Gwen Shanks and Aviva Roth-Jaffe, are the Berkeley Birth Partners, two semi-legendary midwives who have welcomed more than a thousand newly minted citizens into the dented utopia at whose heartÃ¢â‚¬â€half tavern, half templeÃ¢â‚¬â€stands Brokeland.\n\nWhen exÃ¢â‚¬â€œNFL quarterback Gibson Goode, the fifth-richest black man in America, announces plans to build his latest Dogpile megastore on a nearby stretch of Telegraph Avenue, Nat and Archy fear it means certain doom for their vulnerable little enterprise. Meanwhile, Aviva and Gwen also find themselves caught up in a battle for their professional existence, one that tests the limits of their friendship. Adding another layer of complication to the couples' already tangled lives is the surprise appearance of Titus Joyner, the teenage son Archy has never acknowledged and the love of fifteen-year-old Julius Jaffe's life.\n\nAn intimate epic, a NorCal Middlemarch set to the funky beat of classic vinyl soul-jazz and pulsing with a virtuosic, pyrotechnical style all its own, Telegraph Avenue is the great American novel we've been waiting for. Generous, imaginative, funny, moving, thrilling, humane, triumphant, it is Michael Chabon's most dazzling book yet.\n\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n           **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n              Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3339408a14b466707c03c802462c77c7ae5ca19","amp;dn":"Telegraph+Avenue+by+Michael+Chabon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3339408a14b466707c03c802462c77c7ae5ca19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,51,148,8,161,75,70,103,7,192,60,128,36,98,199,124,122,229,202,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
