(Tortora)\n\nThe new edition of Principles of Anatomy and Physiology maintains the superb balance between structure and function. It continues to emphasize the correlations between normal physiology and pathophysiology, normal anatomy and pathology, and homeostasis and homeostatic imbalances. The acclaimed illustration program is also even better along with the redevelopment of many of the figures depicting the toughest topics to grasp.\n\n\n\nIn PDF format and in color. Hope someone can use it!\n\nAlso, please help me seed this, I'm on DSL so I have to spare my bandwidth somewhat.
