Thousands of years ago, ancient Egyptian priests recorded that 'gods of the first time' revealed to them exquisite information on the nature of the afterlife and the keys of mastering death. That cherished insight was guarded with utmost secrecy through the millennia and revealed only to selected members of certain Mystery Schools. In later times, high initiates hid the essence of the sacred secret into the Bible and developed a series of ciphers that enabled the hidden wisdom to be unlocked by the privileged few, many of who are among the most prominent people in history. Now, for the first time in contemporary history, comes a book, which fully reveals that exalted knowledge, providing a new and fascinating insight into the extraordinary 'Secret of the Dead'. In explaining why the Holy Bible was always considered a divine book, The Secret in the Bible, reveals new knowledge about the ancient secrets of Egypt and the Bible and the significance of these secrets cannot be taken lightly. The author backs up this knowledge with an extensive bibliography. Also find out how biblical Psalms precisely contain all Egyptian Tarot cards in encrypted form and how the card pictures cleverly hide all 22 letters of an ancient alphabet embedded in them. 345 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f90bbc96d5a3c7e6ea63b2659dfd725fed3b061e","amp;dn":"Bushby-The+Secret+in+the+Bible%28Great+Pyramid%2CMissing+Capstone%2COr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f90bbc96d5a3c7e6ea63b2659dfd725fed3b061e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,11,188,150,213,163,199,230,234,99,178,101,157,253,114,95,237,59,6,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
