Originally released as a double album.\n\n The band wrote and recorded eight songs at Headley Grange; these eight songs stretched beyond the typical length of an LP. The band decided to make Physical Graffiti a double album by including unreleased tracks from earlier recording sessions: one outtake from Led Zeppelin III; three from Led Zeppelin IV; and three from Houses of the Holy including its unused title track.\n\n\n Led Zeppelin returned from a nearly two-year hiatus in 1975 with the double-album Physical Graffiti, their most sprawling and ambitious work. Where Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy integrated influences on each song, the majority of the tracks on Physical Graffiti are individual stylistic workouts. The highlights are when Zeppelin incorporate influences and stretch out into new stylistic territory, most notably on the tense, Eastern-influenced &quot;Kashmir.&quot; &quot;Trampled Underfoot,&quot; with John Paul Jones' galloping keyboard, is their best funk-metal workout, while &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; is their best attempt at pop, and &quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; is the closest they've come to country. Even the heavier blues -- the 11-minute &quot;In My Time of Dying,&quot; the tightly wound &quot;Custard Pie,&quot; and the monstrous epic &quot;The Rover&quot; -- are louder and more extended and textured than their previous work. Also, all of the heavy songs are on the first record, leaving the rest of the album to explore more adventurous territory, whether it's acoustic tracks or grandiose but quiet epics like the affecting &quot;Ten Years Gone.&quot; The second half of Physical Graffiti feels like the group is cleaning the vaults out, issuing every little scrap of music they set to tape in the past few years. That means that the album is filled with songs that aren't quite filler, but don't quite match the peaks of the album, either. Still, even these songs have their merits -- &quot;Sick Again&quot; is the meanest, most decadent rocker they ever recorded, and the folky acoustic rock &amp; roll of &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot; and &quot;Black Country Woman&quot; may be tossed off, but they have a relaxed, off-hand charm that Zeppelin never matched. It takes a while to sort out all of the music on the album, but Physical Graffiti captures the whole experience of Led Zeppelin at the top of their game better than any of their other albums. Reviewed by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of allmusic.com  \n\nPHYSICAL GRAFFITI DELUXE EDITION ARRIVES EXACTLY 40 YEARS AFTER DEBUT, \n PRODUCED AND NEWLY REMASTERED BY JIMMY PAGE, WITH PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED COMPANION AUDIO\n\n The Led Zeppelin reissue campaign continues in 2015, turning the spotlight on the double album Physical Graffiti. The deluxe edition of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sixth studio album will arrive 40 years to the day after the original debuted on February 24, 1975. As with the previous deluxe editions, Physical Graffiti has been newly remastered by guitarist and producer Jimmy Page and is accompanied by a disc of companion audio comprising previously unreleased music related to the original release.\n\n Certified 16x platinum in the U.S., the commercial success of Physical Graffiti was equaled by its critical reception. Generally regarded as one of the greatest double albums of all time, the original 15 tracks represent a creative tour de force that explores the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic musical range, from the driving rock of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Custard PieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an acoustic arrangement of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bron-Yr-AurÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to the Eastern raga of Ã¢â‚¬Å“KashmirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and funky groove of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trampled Under Foot.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe companion audio disc that accompanies the deluxe edition of Physical Graffiti has seven unreleased tracks, including rough mixes of Ã¢â‚¬Å“In My Time Of DyingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Houses Of The Holy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as an early mix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trampled Under FootÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brandy &amp; Coke.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ All the unreleased companion tracks offer fans a chance to hear well-known songs from a different perspective, including the Sunset Sound mix of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Boogie With StuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Driving Through Kashmir,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a rough orchestra mix of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eight minute opus Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kashmir.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Also featured is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everybody Makes It Through,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a strikingly different early version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“In The LightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with alternate lyrics.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
