They include a volcano in Iceland, a cave in the jungles of Central America, and a lake of fire in Africa. According to ancient myth and Christian legend, each is a passage to a terrifying underworld for the damned. Even today, some believe they are still portals. Eerily, they share striking similarities. \n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll visit these six locations, and along the way, reveal how the concept of Hell emerged in history and why it still evokes fear today.Legendary volcanoes, geysers and faultlines found in Iceland, Mexico, Greece, Italy and Japan appear to descend into another reality an underworld deep within the earth. In some cases, they have been seen as 'hellmouths'. We will investigate each of these places and reveal the geological reasons they evoked such fear and awe.\n\n\nWe will also launch a larger exploration into the history of the concept of the underworld: civilizations have often conceived of a physical world within the earth that operates with its own structure and rules. From Dante's Inferno to the Mayan Gates of Hell, each legend speaks of a portal divided into a series of steps. We will decode the symbolism of each passage, identify the unique elements from each civilization, and reveal the universal truths to the timeless concept of the underworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced &amp; written by: Stephen Dost\n===================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Gates Of Hell\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:27:52\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2173 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    1.33 GB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2388410c4bfc6095257e0bf4d38f65eb80f1d683","amp;dn":"Gates+Of+Hell-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2388410c4bfc6095257e0bf4d38f65eb80f1d683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,136,65,12,75,252,96,149,37,126,11,244,211,143,101,235,128,241,214,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
