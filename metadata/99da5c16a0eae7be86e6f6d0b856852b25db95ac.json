If you got the tools, you can repair your AC in your automobile with this DVD.\n\nI found this DVD iso on one of those file hosting sites that has since been shut down.  It was stored in a spanned .rar archive file that took forever to download.  I unzipped them and this is the ISO file I ended up with.\n\nThe DVD will play - however I believe AutoZone used a cut-rate DVD authoring tool to assemble the actual DVD.  If anyone can figure out a good way to rip the entire DVD to a singlexvid file, please do so and share.  I just dont have the time right now.\n\nThe versions of &quot;WinX DVD Ripper&quot; and &quot;DVD to AVI&quot; that I rub can not find individual videos segments on this iso due to the formatting.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99da5c16a0eae7be86e6f6d0b856852b25db95ac","amp;dn":"AutoZone+Presents+Diagnosing+and+Repairing+Air+Conditioning+Syst","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99da5c16a0eae7be86e6f6d0b856852b25db95ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,218,92,22,160,234,231,190,134,230,246,208,184,86,133,43,37,219,149,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
