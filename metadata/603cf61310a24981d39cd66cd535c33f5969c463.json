Wondering why the sky is blue helped British scientists crack bacterial infection, whilst looking for a way to make quinine helped make our world a much more colourful place, as it led to the discovery of the first synthetic organic dye. But is this the best way to carry on? Professor Brian Cox ends his homage to British Science by looking at how discoveries are made, asking whether it is better to let the scientists do their own thing, and hope for happy accidents, or to only back scientific winners at the risk of missing the occasional gems.\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate:  1497 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 404\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s  48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: stereo (2/0)\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: average 686 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:603cf61310a24981d39cd66cd535c33f5969c463","amp;dn":"BBC.Science.Britannica.3of3.Clear.Blue.Skies.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"603cf61310a24981d39cd66cd535c33f5969c463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,60,246,19,16,162,73,129,211,156,214,108,213,53,195,63,89,105,196,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
