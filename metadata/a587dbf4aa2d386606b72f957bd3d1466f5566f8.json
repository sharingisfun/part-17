In the BBC adaptation of Dorothy Sayers's detective novel, which also aired on PBS, the brilliant Lord Peter Wimsey brings his investigative talents to use close to home. His future brother-in-law is slain during a country retreat, and while there seems to be no shortage of possible suspects, the investigation quickly centers on Wimsey's brother Gerald, the Duke of Windsor. The four-hour adaptation takes its delicious time in delving deeper into the psyche of the unhappy circle around the deceased, as Wimsey tries to avert a full trial of a peer of the realm. Ian Carmichael shines as Wimsey, one of English detective fiction's most memorable heroes--more nimble than Miss Marple, more willful than Poirot, more upbeat than Adam Dalgliesh. All mystery fans need for a lovely and satisfying afternoon is this series and a couple of strong pots of tea.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a587dbf4aa2d386606b72f957bd3d1466f5566f8","amp;dn":"Lord+Peter+Wimsey+-+Clouds+of+Witness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a587dbf4aa2d386606b72f957bd3d1466f5566f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,135,219,244,170,45,56,102,6,183,47,149,123,211,209,70,111,85,102,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
