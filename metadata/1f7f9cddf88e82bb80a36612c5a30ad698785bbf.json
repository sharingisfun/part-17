Hershl Sperling was one of them. He escaped. Why then, fifty years later, did he jump to his death from a bridge in Scotland? The answer lies in a long-forgotten, published account of the Treblinka death camp, written by Hershl Sperling himself in the months after liberation and discovered in his briefcase after his suicide. It is reproduced here for the first time. In &quot;Treblinka Survivor&quot;, Mark S. Smith traces the life of a man who survived five concentration camps, and what he had to do to achieve this. Hershl's story - which takes the reader through his childhood in a small Polish town to the bridge in faraway Scotland, is testament to the lasting torment of those very few who survived the Nazis' most efficient and gruesome death factory. The author personally follows in his subject's footsteps from Klobuck, to Treblinka, to Glasgow.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Treblinka-Survivor-Death-Hershl-Sperling/dp/0752456180&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Treblinka-Survivor-Death-Hershl-Sperling/dp/0752456180&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrom Amazon.com.\nDeDRM'd with Calibre and plugins.\nSee:for info on how you can help, if you have a Kindle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f7f9cddf88e82bb80a36612c5a30ad698785bbf","amp;dn":"Treblinka+Survivor%3A+The+Life+and+Death+of+Hershl+Sperling+-+Smit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f7f9cddf88e82bb80a36612c5a30ad698785bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,127,156,221,248,142,130,187,128,163,102,18,197,163,10,214,152,120,91,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
