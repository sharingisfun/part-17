Written and illustrated by Matt Howarth, Star Crossed recounts the surrealist tale of a deep-space romance between a genetically engineered ÃƒÂ¼ber-woman and a sentient asteroid. Consistent with the performance of other Helix titles, Star Crossed failed to appeal to a broad readership and the poor sales figures which accompanied its publication coincided with a general downturn in the comic book industry.\n\nDyltah is a being from the far-future, a loner she forsakes the humanity of her upbringing and elects to undergo a genetic transformation, becoming Ã¢â‚¬Å“a living lightsailÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who glides the solar currents of deep space. She commences an unlikely romance with Saa, a sentient chunk of space-rock. Part parody, part space opera, Star Crossed pays oblique homage to ShakespeareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Romeo and Juliet as the dalliance of the two lovers draws the attention of various political factions within the Solar System including that of human beings who live in a pod colony in orbit near Jupiter. The mutated Jovians are antagonised by the presence of the genetically-optimised Dyltah and the various parties are gradually drawn into conflict as the narrative develops.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac192da599fed9e70ff68f1c8bf82bc1ebfc7efe","amp;dn":"Matt+Howarth%3A+Star+Crossed+%23+1-3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac192da599fed9e70ff68f1c8bf82bc1ebfc7efe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,25,45,165,153,254,217,231,15,246,143,28,139,248,43,193,235,252,126,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
