I did not bother to put the album singles but instead I used the original album. Some albums are difficult to find so I left things such as the live versions of songs in their original mp3 format but labeled them as differently and some albums are non-existent. This compilation is missing 4 songs from the Wikipedia list and I am not planning on adding them. The missing songs are Re-education (Through Labor), The One I Love, and the Ted Nugent/Zakk Wylde guitar duels.\n\nList can be viewed at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_hero_world_tour_songs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_hero_world_tour_songs&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI added The One I Love and Re-Education (Through Labor) at this torrent. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4528728&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4528728&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI also fixed an ID3 tag. Otherwise, this torrent and the other one are identical.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844e1faae211daad402ac02625b9fd44887c09dc","amp;dn":"Guitar+Hero+World+Tour+Soundtrack+Updated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844e1faae211daad402ac02625b9fd44887c09dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,78,31,170,226,17,218,173,64,42,192,38,37,185,253,68,136,124,9,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
