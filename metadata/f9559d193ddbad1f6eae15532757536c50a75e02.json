Their battlefield reputation varied widely, from the premier armoured divisions which formed Germany's utterly reliable spearheads on both main fronts, to low quality 'anti-partisan' units. The divisions covered in this second of four titles include the first mountain and cavalry units, and two of the remarkable new Panzer divisions raised in the great 1943 expansion. Illustrated with rare photographs from private collections, the text details their organisation, uniforms and insignia, and summarises their battle record","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9559d193ddbad1f6eae15532757536c50a75e02","amp;dn":"The+Waffen-SS+%282%29%3A+6.+To+10.+Divisions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9559d193ddbad1f6eae15532757536c50a75e02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,85,157,25,61,219,173,31,110,174,21,83,39,87,83,108,80,167,94,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
