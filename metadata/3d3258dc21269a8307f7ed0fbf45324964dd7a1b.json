Cabrera, FÃ©lix A. Miranda (Pan Stanford, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-981-4463-19-5\r\n\r\nAdvanced Nanomaterials for Aerospace Applications has been developed for a community interested in space science and nanotechnology. Scientists and engineers from several NASA field centers and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, University of Puerto Rico, The Pennsylvania State University, and INFN-Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Italy, have joined efforts to discuss the applications of nanomaterials in sensors, atmosphere revitalization in habitable space platforms, life support systems, regenerative fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, robust lightweight materials, nanoelectronics, and electromagnetic shielding. The book concludes with chapters that discuss bringing NASA-relevant nanotechnology into the classroom and the future directions in nanotechnology research and development at NASA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d3258dc21269a8307f7ed0fbf45324964dd7a1b","amp;dn":"Advanced+Nanomaterials+for+Aerospace+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d3258dc21269a8307f7ed0fbf45324964dd7a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,50,88,220,33,38,154,131,7,247,237,15,191,69,50,73,100,221,122,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
