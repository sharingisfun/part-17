Narrated by Leonard Graves and set to a score by Richard Rodgers, this program offered a remarkable look at the realities of naval warfare and the extraordinary challenges faced by the Allies. From U-boat &quot;wolf packs&quot; to the epic battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, every major naval engagement of World War II is captured in some of the most riveting combat footage ever shot.\n\n\n\n17)  The Turkey Shoot \nGuam, a U.S. territory, is invaded by Japanese a few days after Pearl Harbor and remains occupied for two and a half years before the Americans arrive to reclaim Saipan and Guam, and destroy as well the Japanese fleet in a classic &quot;turkey shoot&quot;. The Guamanians are thankful as expressed on their smiling faces, making it one of the most inspiring segments of Victory at Sea. Meanwhile, the Americans are preparing the bases in the islands as well as in other areas of the Marianas for the ultimate bomber offensive against Japan.\n\n18)  Two If by Sea \nBefore the Philippines Islands, the United States first attacks Peleliu and Anguar. Through communiques, viewers see the battle.\n\n19)  Battle for Leyte Gul \nThe Japanese fleet is disintegrating, and the Imperial Navy conducts its last major operation in the Philippines. It ends in debacle: The risen battleships of Pearl Harbor avenge the attack in Surigao Strait, the Center Force is defeated in Sibuyan Sea, the jeep carriers and destroyers fend off a stronger Japanese force near Samar and the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers are sunk. This Victory at Sea segment marked the near inevitability that the Japanese would accept defeat and surrender to the Allies.\n\n20)  Return of the Allies \nJust after the U.S. entered World War II, the Japanese conquered the Commonwealth of the Philippines, an American protectorate, occupying its people. But they still hope, and in January 1945, these were answered as much of the Philippines Islands were liberated and its people cheered the Americans. Their liberation became bloody as they fought their way in Manila, but still they cheered. A touching tribute to the will of the Philippine people to survive as they waited for liberation-and their eventual independence a year later.\n\n21)  Full Fathom Five \nIn this episode of Victory at Sea, viewers see how the U.S. Navy's submarines contributed to the Japanese empire's defeat, sinking thousands of tons of commercial ships. Viewers see footage of ship upon ship destroyed. But a price is paid for those whom the U.S. Navy classifies as &quot;did not return&quot;.\n\n22)  The Fate of Europe \nSevastopol was liberated and the Allies finally defeat Germany. Viewers also witness the meeting of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin for final plans for Germany's surrender and the forming of the United Nations. At the end, Hitler commits suicide, and Nazi flags are torn apart and German military uniforms and hats lie on the ground, discarded. However, compelling footage of German cities in ruins make this one of the most somber episodes of Victory at Sea.\n\n23)  Target Suribachi \nThe United States fought two battles here-the U.S. Marines at Iwo Jima against the Japanese, and the U.S. Navy against the typhoon. During the now-legendary events depicted in this episode, the series reaches the final throes of battle in the Pacific war against the Japanese. And as the scene of the recent Mount Suribachi memorial appears, viewers are once again reminded of the price that comes before true victory can be achieved.\n\n24)  The Road to Mandalay \nThe Japanese invade China in 1936, but the Japanese are not satisfied and they invade Indochina and Thailand, enabling the invasion of Burma. The U.S. and British navies nurture their relations with the Indian Navy as supplies are built for the return. Eventually, it was decided to build a road to link with the Burma Road, and with human and elephant power, they succeeded. Eventually, they &quot;came back to Mandalay&quot;, and the first supplies travelled the road to hordes of cheering Chinese.\n\n25)  Suicide for Glory \nIn a last effort at glory, having lost most of their best men in military actions, Japan employs suicide pilots-the Kamikaze-men who willingly crash their planes into ships in order to destroy the American spirit. But the U.S. Navy and Marines are ready for them with their guns, and they fought heroically against the onslaught. And on Okinawa, Americans fight a major battle with the Japanese Army.\n\n26)  Design for Peace \nThe atomic bomb is detonated, and its effects demonstrated at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. With that, the Japanese surrender, and their diplomats and military officials sign the official surrender documents aboard the USS Missouri. The U.S. armed forces come home to signs saying, &quot;Welcome Home&quot; before they are greeted by mothers, wives, children and fellow neighbours. But before the series is ended, there is one last parade to march in their honor.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3286/67l9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3286/67l9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9752/0tz0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9752/0tz0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1628/mxe6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img35.imageshack.us/img35/1628/mxe6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2465/judp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/2465/judp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/3457/p6rh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/3457/p6rh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/285/q34b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/285/q34b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2388/7krt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2388/7krt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/795/0ute.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img4.imageshack.us/img4/795/0ute.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/9605/etpq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/9605/etpq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1029 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 544\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 27.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 26\n * Part Size: average 232 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_at_Sea&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_at_Sea&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e43aa5cd3cda403bcb25959e33df0b3f08b1ace","amp;dn":"Victory+At+Sea+17of26+The+Turkey+Shoot+DVDRip+XviD+AC3+MVGroup.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e43aa5cd3cda403bcb25959e33df0b3f08b1ace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,67,170,92,211,205,164,3,188,178,89,89,227,61,240,179,240,139,26,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
