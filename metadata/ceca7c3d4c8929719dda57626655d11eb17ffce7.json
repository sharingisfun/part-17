Produced on a micro-budget of $200,000 by a non-profit arts foundation, YESTERDAY has gone on to receive over a dozen film festival Best Feature awards, critical praise, and a release by E1 Entertainment U.S.\n\nKipleigh Brown &quot;exudes Bacall&quot; (Slice of SciFi) as Hoyle, a girl with a sharp mind and a weakness for bourbon who finds herself on the trail of a reclusive genius (John Newton). But her work takes a series of unforeseen twists as events around her grow increasingly fragmented... disconnected... surreal.\n\nWith a sexy lounge singer (Chase Masterson) and a loyal partner (Mik Scriba) as her only allies, Hoyle is plunged into a dark world of intrigue and earth-shattering cosmological secrets. Haunted by an ever-present shadow (Peter Mayhew) whom she is destined to face, Hoyle discovers that the most powerful force in the universe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the power to bend reality, the power to know the truth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lies within the depths of the human heart. &quot;This ambitious film is a stunner, nothing less than the arrival of a major filmmaker&quot; (Dennis Willis, KGO Radio / Flick Nation).\n\nRipper.........: CaptainSlow\nSource.........: DVD\nLength.........: 88 Mins\nAspect Ratio...: 1.78:1\nResolution.....: 624x352\nVideo Bitrate..: 963 kb/s\nVideo Framerate: 23.976 fps\nAudio Bitrate..: 133 kb/s MP3 Stereo English\nSubtitles......: English\n\ncredit VH-PROD &amp; CaptainSlow &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceca7c3d4c8929719dda57626655d11eb17ffce7","amp;dn":"Yesterday.Was.A.Lie.2008.DVDRip.XviD-VH-PROD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceca7c3d4c8929719dda57626655d11eb17ffce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,202,124,61,76,137,41,113,157,218,87,98,102,85,209,30,177,127,252,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
