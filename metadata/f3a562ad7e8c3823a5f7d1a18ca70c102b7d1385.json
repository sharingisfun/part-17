Whereas their debut, Good, was intriguing yet not entirely consistent, Cure for Pain more than delivered. The songwriting was stronger and more succinct this time around, while new drummer Billy Conway made his recording debut with the trio (replacing Jerome Deupree). Like the debut, most of the material shifts between depressed and upbeat, with a few cacophonic rockers thrown in between. Such selections as &quot;Buena,&quot; &quot;I'm Free Now,&quot; &quot;All Wrong,&quot; &quot;Candy,&quot; &quot;Thursday,&quot; &quot;In Spite of Me&quot; (one of the few tracks to contain six-string guitar), &quot;Let's Take a Trip Together,&quot; &quot;Sheila,&quot; and the title track are all certifiable Morphine classics. And again, Mark Sandman's two-string slide bass and Dana Colley's sax work help create impressive atmospherics throughout the album. Cure for Pain was unquestionably one of the best and most cutting-edge rock releases of the '90s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a562ad7e8c3823a5f7d1a18ca70c102b7d1385","amp;dn":"Morphine+-+Cure+for+Pain+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a562ad7e8c3823a5f7d1a18ca70c102b7d1385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,165,98,173,126,140,56,35,165,247,209,161,140,167,12,16,43,125,19,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
