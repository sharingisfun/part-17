This is PTC's Pro Engineer 4.0 (F000), which means this is not a post production or beta, this is the final release of 4.0.  \n\nI installed it and ran it, seems to work fine.  The crack for PROe and Mechanica will register as a virus variant with NOD32, but rest assured that it caused no harm and is a false positive.  \n\nThis is not my work, I am just uploading this torrent on TPB so users can have acces to this great release.\n\nPlease seed this great release, all the ones I see on here are pre-production releases.\n\nForgot to mention, tested and works on Windows 7 final, 64-bit.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCreate folder in My Documents called &quot;ProELicense&quot; and place the license.dat and ProEWF3MxxxWF4_crk.exe files here.\n\nAfter burning ISO images to CD, start the installation of ProE. NOTE: the first install screen will contain your Hostname and HostID information at the bottom. Write this down before continuing! Do not continue install until step 4.\n\nOpen &quot;license.dat&quot; (the one you just put in ProELicense) in any text editor and change all strings &quot;YOURHOST_ID&quot; with the HostID that you copied from the first install screen. Save and close this file.\n\nContinue install of ProE WF4 F000 using &quot;license.dat&quot; as &quot;Nodelocked License File (No Server running)&quot; - you will have to browse to the new folder location. You can choose to install ProMechanica with this install. Complete insallation.\n\nAfter install is complete run ProEWF3MxxxWF4crk.exe\n\nWait for system messages &quot;Pro/ENGINEER 3: successsfully patched!&quot; &quot;Pro/Mechanica 3: successsfully patched!&quot;\n\nClick OK That's all..\n\nP.S. If you did not install Pro/Mechanica you will get a message &quot;Pro/Mechanica 3: product not installed or files not found!&quot;\n\nClick OK\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4256ebe5fb7e9c063a618f2bffcbf323fc4e3a3e","amp;dn":"PTC+Pro+Engineer+4.0+%28Final%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4256ebe5fb7e9c063a618f2bffcbf323fc4e3a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,86,235,229,251,126,156,6,58,97,143,43,255,203,243,35,252,78,58,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
