The Disasters of War are a set of 83 etchings that offer a harrowing account of the atrocities of the Peninsular War (1807-14), but for Jake Chapman they are much more than a matter of historical record. They have provided the inspiration for countless Chapman Brothers artworks across more than two decades, from model recreations and 'rectified' prints to shop mannequins and full-scale sculptures in bronze, some of which were nominated for the Turner Prize.\r\nIn this film, Jake explores why Goya's famous etching series is so central to his art. He re-examines his relationship to the Spanish artist by visiting Goya's hometown Zaragoza for the first time, and by spending time at the Prado in Madrid where some of Goya's greatest works hang on the walls. \r\nAs Jake works on a new 'Disasters of War' model in his London studio, he explains why for him there is a fundamental conflict at the heart of Goya's art - in their gruesome detail his images seem to celebrate violence rather than protest against it. Jake explores this contradiction that art history has chosen to ignore, and explains how it tells us something profound about the way we see ourselves and our past.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Goya-Exposed-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Goya-Exposed-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bd/Goya-Exposed-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Goya-Exposed-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/Goya-Exposed-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/75/Goya-Exposed-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Goya-Exposed-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Goya-Exposed-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Goya-Exposed-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5b/Goya-Exposed-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Goya-Exposed-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ca/Goya-Exposed-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Goya-Exposed-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Goya-Exposed-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Goya-Exposed-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/df/Goya-Exposed-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3028 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 131 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 655 MB\r\n * Source: WebRip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06s1w08\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Goya%20-%20Crazy%20Like%20A%20Genius \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Masterpieces%201800-1850 \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Great%20Artists%3A%20The%20Collection \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Art%20of%20Spain \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Shock%20of%20the%20New \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Saatchi%20100","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9a963a694354578511831b79381c96ec98511e9","amp;dn":"BBC+Goya+Exposed+with+Jake+Chapman+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9a963a694354578511831b79381c96ec98511e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,169,99,166,148,53,69,120,81,24,49,183,147,129,201,110,201,133,17,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
