It covers recurrent themes in nanocolloid science, including self-assembly, construction of supramolecular architecture, nanoconfinement and compartmentalization, measurement and control of interfacial forces, novel synthetic materials, and computer simulation. The authors reviews surface forces apparatus measurements of two-dimensional organized ensembles at solid-liquid interfaces","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06bd679d303e8795a31814a14b5297e521acd5a8","amp;dn":"Nano-Surface+Chemistry+-+Morton+Rosoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06bd679d303e8795a31814a14b5297e521acd5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,189,103,157,48,62,135,149,163,24,20,161,75,82,151,229,33,172,213,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
