Drag City has more rarities and unusual items than its companion disc, Wild Surf, which means its appeal is limited -- although there are some fun tracks on the disc, it has too much filler to make it consistently enjoyable.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/monster-summer-hits-drag-city-r23504&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/monster-summer-hits-drag-city-r23504&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002UYJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002UYJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
