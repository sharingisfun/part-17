He feels the art of getting out there and finding stories is being forgotten and he is not about to let that happen. So tries to remind his colleagues that journalism is meant to ask difficult questions and report proper news - not soft-sell celebrity interviews, rehashed PR stories and offer up lifestyle questionnaires.\n\nComedy.org.uk Review: \n[quote]This show has made a very positive impression on us. It's a clever and very accurate satire on all that is wrong with the world of modern journalism and the increasing trend within the newspaper industry to try to boost circulation with celebrity stories rather than proper reporting.[/quote]\n[url]http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/electric_ink/episodes/[/url]\n\n\nCast:\nMaddox ......
