An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories.\nWith the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun.\nThe protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.\nWhat new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.\n\nMinimum system requirements\nSupported OS: MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® XP(Service Pack 2)/MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® 2000 SP4 \nProcessor: Intel Pentium 4 2.0 Ghz / AMD XP 2200+\nGraphics: 128 MB DirectXÃ‚Â® 8.0 compatible card / nVIDIAÃ‚Â® GeForceÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 5700 / ATI RadeonÃ‚Â® 9600 \nMemory: 512 MB RAM \nSound: DirectXÃ‚Â® 9.0 compatible sound card \nHard Drive: 10 GB free hard disc space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fdaa76052e12dd1b577eae574006b3e2b5a7367","amp;dn":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.%3A+Clear+Sky+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fdaa76052e12dd1b577eae574006b3e2b5a7367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,218,167,96,82,225,45,209,181,119,234,229,116,0,107,62,43,90,115,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
