But GarrettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s case is turned upside down when beautiful, mysterious Tanith Cabarrus, a practicing witch from nearby Salem, walks into the homicide bureau and insists that the real perpetrator is still at large. Tanith claims to have had psychic visions that the killer has ritually sacrificed other teenagers in his attempts to summon a powerful, ancient demon.  \n\nAll Garrett's beliefs about the nature of reality will be tested as he is forced to team up with a woman he is fiercely attracted to but cannot trust, in a race to uncover a psychotic killer before he strikes again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58a3d15a950b8efbd3640ed88efa3557243e26a5","amp;dn":"Book+of+Shadows+by+Alexandra+Sokoloff+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58a3d15a950b8efbd3640ed88efa3557243e26a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,163,209,90,149,11,142,251,211,100,14,216,142,250,53,87,36,62,38,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
