The album follows up Wareham's equally compelling 2013 five-song EP, Emancipated Hearts, and explores a similarly baroque and folk-pop-leaning sound with all the latitude offered by a full-length record. In that sense, the album fits nicely into Wareham's existing discography as the leader of bands like Galaxie 500, Luna, and Dean &amp; Britta, the latter two being critically acclaimed projects with his wife and bassist, Britta Phillips (who appears here as well). While Wareham has always evinced a love of dewy-eyed '60s and '70s pop music, here he imbues his softly melodic, sweetly poignant, and often psychedelic sound with a somewhat regretful and sad tone.
