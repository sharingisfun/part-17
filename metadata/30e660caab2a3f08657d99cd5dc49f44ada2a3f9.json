Peppers Lonely Harts Club Band become Sgt. Hetfields Motorbreath Pub Band\nHey Jude becomes Hey dude\nI want To Hold Your Hand becomes I Want To Choke Your Band\nA Hard Days Night becomes A Garage days Night\nWe Can Work it Out becomes We Can Hit the Lights\n\nAll played in a Metallica style with a very good James Hetfield. A must for any fans with a sense of humour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30e660caab2a3f08657d99cd5dc49f44ada2a3f9","amp;dn":"Beatallica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30e660caab2a3f08657d99cd5dc49f44ada2a3f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,230,96,202,171,42,63,8,101,125,153,205,93,196,159,68,173,162,163,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
