RX Loudness Control works faster than real-time to ensure your audio mixes are delivered within the appropriate loudness standards. Designed specifically for audio/video post production and broadcast workflows, RX Loudness Control combines industry-leading, intelligent audio signal processing with an easy-to-use interface.\r\n\r\nKey Highlights\r\nâ€¢Ensure your mixes meet the required delivery specifications with truly intelligent algorithms that take out the guesswork.\r\nâ€¢Deliver results globally with a single product offering the latest, greatest, loudness standards.\r\nâ€¢Produce more content than ever with extensive presets, a curated featureset, and a fast, efficient workflow that saves you time on the final stage of TV production.\r\n\r\nIntuitive Workflow\r\nRender your audio to be loudness compliant and appropriate for delivery and broadcastâ€”all with just two clicks! A history graph and loudness report inform you of whether your audio is within the appropriate tolerance of the selected loudness standard, and if not, shows you where the overflows may be occurring. An easy-to-use interface guides you seamlessly through the workflow, displaying relevant and useful loudness metering.\r\n\r\nSurround Sound\r\nChannel count formats vary from project to project, and loudness standards can dictate specs for surround channel counts. To ensure loudness compliance in any channel format you may be working with, RX Loudness Control supports mono, stereo, and surround channel counts up to 5.1 for seamless integration into any workflow.\r\n\r\nIRCâ„¢ II Limiting\r\nExisting automated loudness correction tools can sometimes produce questionable sound quality. Fortunately, RX Loudness Control includes IRC (Intelligent Release Control) II, an incredibly transparent limiting algorithm that sonically outperforms the competition. This offline process corrects a mono, stereo, or surround sound audio file for True Peak value (dBTP).\r\n\r\nGlobal Loudness Standards\r\nWith so many loudness specifications being introduced and refined across the globe, it can be difficult to maintain loudness compliance for multiple broadcast networks. RX Loudness Control boasts an extensive list of the latest and most significant global loudness standards. Select from among the following loudness standards:\r\n\r\nâ€¢BS.1770-1 (Global)\r\nâ€¢BS.1770-2-3 (Global)\r\nâ€¢EBU R128 (Europe)\r\nâ€¢EBU R128 s1 (Europe)\r\nâ€¢AGCOM 219/09/CSP (Italy)\r\nâ€¢ATSC A/85 (U.S.)\r\nâ€¢OP-59 (Australia)\r\nâ€¢ARIB TR-B32 (Japan)\r\n\r\nRX Loudness Control System Requirements\r\nOperating system requirements:\r\n\r\nRX Loudness Control runs as a plug-in for your video or audio editing software.\r\n\r\n   Windows: 7 or later\r\n   Mac: OS X 10.7-10.10 (Intel only)\r\n\r\nPlug-in formats:\r\n\r\nAudioSuite DPM &amp; AAX, Adobe Extension for Premiere Pro CC, and Adobe Extension for Media Encoder CC.\r\nHost compatibility:\r\n\r\nRX Loudness Control is currently compatible as plug-ins for Pro Tools 10-12, Media Composer 7.0.4 and 8.3.1, and Premiere Pro CC.
