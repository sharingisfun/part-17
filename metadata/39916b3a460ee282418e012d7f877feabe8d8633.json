Make Room!\n\nThe world is crowded. Far too crowded. Its starving billions live on lentils, soya beans, and Ã¢â‚¬â€if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re luckyÃ¢â‚¬â€the odd starving rat.\n\nIn a New York City groaning under the burden of 35 million inhabitants, detective Andy Rusch is engaged in a desperate and lonely hunt for a killer everyone has forgotten. For even in a world such as this, a policeman can find himself utterly aloneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nAcclaimed on its original publication in 1966, Make Room! Make Room! was adapted into the movie Soylent Green in 1973, starring Charlton Heston along with Edward G.
