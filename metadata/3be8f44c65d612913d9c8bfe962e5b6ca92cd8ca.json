Produced by Nickelback and recorded at Mountain View Studios, Vancouver, BC, Here and Now is Nickelback s seventh studio record and is the follow up to 2008 s widely successful Dark Horse which has been certified three-times platinum. &quot;When you listen to this record, it sounds like it could be from four different artists,&quot; says Chad Kroeger. &quot;We always try and do the same thing: We try to do something heavier than we've ever done, more melodic than we've ever done, every single time we do this, and I think we've achieved it again.&quot;\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.This means war                                       [03:21]\n02.Bottoms up                                           [03:37]\n03.When we stand together                               [03:11]\n04.Midnight queen                                       [03:15]\n05.Gotta get me some                                    [03:42]\n06.Lullaby                                              [03:48]\n07.Kiss it goodbye                                      [03:35]\n08.Trying not to love you                               [04:12]\n09.Holding on to heaven                                 [03:52]\n10.Everything I wanna do                                [03:27]\n11.Don't ever let it end                                [03:50]\n____\n\n39:50 min\n 69,9 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
