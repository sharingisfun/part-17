They need money, and a permanent resident status. Claudy is a junkie - he needs money to satisfy his addiction. Andrei, the cigarette smuggler, must hold up for a while outside Russia; he has loads of money. Fabio, the Italian taxi driver and aspiring gang boss, elaborates a clever scheme: he will pay Claudy to marry Lorna so that she acquires a Belgian citizenship. Then she is to re-marry Andrei, who will in this way obtain the coveted EU passport - and pay a hefty price to Fabio and Lorna for the service. Like all plans, this one will not survive the contact with reality.\n\n\nLanguages: French / Albanian / Russian\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c3c139a9402409b418513b3c8977f219689a8e","amp;dn":"Le+Silence+de+Lorna+2008+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c3c139a9402409b418513b3c8977f219689a8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,195,193,57,169,64,36,9,180,24,81,59,60,137,119,242,25,104,154,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
