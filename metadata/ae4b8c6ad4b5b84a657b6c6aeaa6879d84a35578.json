He became known for his unique brand of comedy, which combines elements of political satire and often bizarre or somewhat unsettling black comedy.\n\nGoldthwait and Robin Williams appeared on the same bill together, but not as a comedy team, using the names &quot;Jack Cheese&quot; and &quot;Marty Fromage.&quot; Goldthwait used the name Jack Cheese when he appeared in the film Tapeheads; when Williams made a cameo as Mime Jerry in Goldthwait's Shakes the Clown, he was billed as Marty Fromage.\n\nGoldthwait has appeared in several movies. His first major role was in the Police Academy series. He starred in the 1986 comedy film One Crazy Summer, which also starred John Cusack, and his other big role was in the 1987 comedy film Burglar with Whoopi Goldberg and John Goodman. He also starred in Scrooged with Bill Murray. He notably starred in Hot to Trot in 1988 with John Candy and Dabney Coleman. In 1992, Goldthwait wrote, directed, and starred in the movie Shakes the Clown. He also made a cameo appearance as an insane writer in the 1994 film Radioland Murders. In 1985, Goldthwait appeared in Twisted Sister's official video to the songs &quot;Leader of the pack&quot; and &quot;Be Chrool to Your Scuel&quot;, from the album Come Out and Play. During the fall of 1993 Goldthwait did stand up material as an opening act for Nirvana on what would be their final North American tour, as well as the promo video for the band's album In Utero, and once fooled an interviewer during a phone interview, impersonating Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl.\n\nAn emblematic moment: a guest on one of the last episodes of The Arsenio Hall Show, Goldthwait became demonstrably upset that the program was being cancelled. At the time, it was widely believed that Paramount Studios had refused to renew Hall's contract because The David Letterman Show was now moving to CBS; so, Goldthwait took his anger out on Paramount. He stood on the set's couch, spray-painted &quot;Paramount Sucks&quot; on a glass wall, knocked over some video equipment, then threw cushions from the couch into the audience (they cheered).\n\nGoldthwait announced his retirement from stand-up in 2005 and performed a &quot;final&quot; run in Vegas in September 2005;[citation needed] He briefly resumed touring in early 2008 (from January through April); He performed again in 2009, doing stand-up in Winnipeg on April 3 &amp; 4, and again in Omaha on August 28 and 29; He returned to Winnipeg for 4 shows on April 9 and 10, 2010.\n\nThe March 28, 2005 article of the New York Post announced that Bobcat Goldthwait was the new director of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live (He had been directing the show since the fall season of 2004). While there, ratings for the show increased to over 2 million viewers per night, and jumped 50% with teens; however, in May 2006 Goldthwait left to pursue his film career. Goldthwait maintains contact with Kimmel (they are friends) and still directs for television and film. He returned to directing segments for Jimmy Kimmel Live in the summer of 2007.\n[edit] Guest appearances\n\nIn 1992, Goldthwait appeared as a guest-co-host of the second episode of the The Ben Stiller Show.\n\nGoldthwait appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 1993, where he tossed furniture and ran around the set, then into the audience. He has also made several guest appearances on talk shows as well as comedy programs. On May 9, 1994, Goldthwait appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, where he briefly lit the guest chair on fire.[3] As a result, he was charged a $2,700 fine along with the cost of the chair ($698); he was also required to tape several public service announcements about fire safety.[3] The incident was later the basis of the plot for his subsequent appearance on The Larry Sanders Show and also inspired a pseudo-fire safety PSA on MadTV. He was also in the 5th episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast, &quot;Bobcat&quot;, &quot;Surprise&quot;, the 37th episode, &quot;Anniversary&quot;, and an uncredited appearance in the episode &quot;Kentuckey Nightmare&quot;.\n\nOne of the most recognizable features of Goldthwait's performances is his voice. Goldthwait has voiced characters on the television series Capitol Critters (1992), The Moxy Show (1995), Unhappily Ever After (1995ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1999), The Tick (1995), Hercules: The Animated Series (1998ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1999), Lilo and Stitch and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000). Goldthwait has also appeared as himself hosting the comedy quiz show Bobcat's Big Ass Show (1998). Goldthwait was also a semi-regular guest in the later seasons of the Tom Bergeron-version of Hollywood Squares in 1998.\n\nMost recently, Goldthwait was a featured guest on the August 20, 2009 episode of Adam Carolla's podcast. And on August 26, 2009 returned to guest on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show with old friend Robin Williams which he revealed a tattoo on his buttocks of an anthropomorphized cymbal with a mustache and slanted eyes (a pun on the cliched Chinese symbol tattoo).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae4b8c6ad4b5b84a657b6c6aeaa6879d84a35578","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Bobcat+Goldthwait+-+Meat+Bob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae4b8c6ad4b5b84a657b6c6aeaa6879d84a35578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,75,140,106,212,181,184,74,101,123,108,106,234,166,135,157,132,163,85,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
