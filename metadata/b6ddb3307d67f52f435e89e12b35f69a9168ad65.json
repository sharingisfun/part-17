The year is 1965 and it has been some time since Danny has had any romantic relationship with a girl (his former love, Freya, from The Year My Voice Broke, left him at the end of the first film). Danny is the butt of jokes because of his stutter and long nose (for which he is nicknamed &quot;Bird&quot;). His only friend is Gilbert.\n\nAt a school rugby game, he meets and slowly becomes interested in Thandiwe Adjewa (Thandie Newton), a Ugandan-Kenyan-British girl (Ugandan father and Kenyan-British mother) attending the all-girls Cirencester LadiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ College across the lake, while her father, a political activist, is lecturing at university in Canberra. They later meet at a debate between the two schools, and covertly during a school dance. She is punished for leaving the dance without permission and is given chores by the prefect, Nicola Radcliffe (Nicole Kidman). Thandiwe is later befriended by Melissa (Kym Wilson) and Janet (Naomi Watts).\n\nThroughout the course of the school year, they foster a budding romance, despite the overbearing regulations inflicted upon them - specifically racial politics and social conventions (Thandiwe is often regarded by the school authorities as rebellious and overtly sexual). After the performance of the musical, Danny introduces his parents to Thandiwe and her parents. They later decide to return to Uganda in response to the political turmoil there. Soon Thandiwe decides to return too, and lies about her true departure date, in order to spend the night in a motel with Danny. They are discovered, leading to his expulsion. Thandiwe writes him letters regularly from Uganda - until one day one arrives from Nairobi saying she is safe there.\n\nAlso known as: Un romance en blanco y negro, Flertando - Aprendendo a Viver, Flirting - Spiel mit der Liebe, La primera experiencia, FlÃƒÂ¶rt, Randka na przerwie, A Idade das EmoÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes, Den fÃƒÂ¶rsta kÃƒÂ¤rleken, ÃÂ¤ÃÂ»ÃÂ¸Ã‘â‚¬Ã‘â€š.\nCountry: Australia\nStudio: Kennedy Miller Productions\nDuration: 01:38:58\n\nFile\nCodec: MPEG2\nQuality: DVD\nVideo: NTSC 16:9 (720x480) VBR Auto Pan&amp;Scan, Auto Letterboxed 29.97 fps 4825 Kbps\nAudio #1: Russian (Dolby AC3, 2 ch, 48.0 KHz, 192 Kbps) ÃÅ¸Ã‘â‚¬ÃÂ¾Ã‘â€žÃÂµÃ‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂ¸ÃÂ¾ÃÂ½ÃÂ°ÃÂ»Ã‘Å’ÃÂ½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂ¹ ÃÂ¼ÃÂ½ÃÂ¾ÃÂ³ÃÂ¾ÃÂ³ÃÂ¾ÃÂ»ÃÂ¾Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘â€¹ÃÂ¹ \nAudio #2: Francais (Dolby AC3, 2 ch, 48.0 KHz, 192 Kbps)\nAudio #3: English (Dolby AC3, 2 ch, 48.0 KHz, 192 Kbps) \nSubtitles #1: English\nSubtitles #2: Francais","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6ddb3307d67f52f435e89e12b35f69a9168ad65","amp;dn":"Flirting+1991+DVD+Nicole+Kidman%2C+Naomi+Watts%2C+Thandie+Newton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6ddb3307d67f52f435e89e12b35f69a9168ad65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,221,179,48,125,103,245,47,67,94,137,225,43,53,246,154,145,104,173,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
