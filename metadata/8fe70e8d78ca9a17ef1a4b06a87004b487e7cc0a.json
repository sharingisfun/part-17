Dr. Murray demonstrates his extensive teaching experience with easy to understand theory and a wide array of examples and helpful tips. Each lesson also includes several completely worked out practice problems like the ones you will see on homework and tests. Sample topics include linear and separable equations, second order equations, series solutions, systems of equations, and Laplace transforms. Dr. Murray received his Ph.D from UC Berkeley, his BS from Georgetown University, and has been teaching in the university setting for 10+ years.\n===============================================\n# of Lectures - 30 \nDuration (hrs:min) - 26:33\nProfessor - William Murray \nTranscript: \n1. First-Order Equations\n2. Second-Order Equations\n3. Series Solutions\n4. Laplace Transform\n5. Review of Linear Algebra\n6. Systems of Equations\n7. Inhomogeneous Systems\n8. Numerical Techniques\n9. Partial Differential Equations\n\nP.S. i put a little twist to this upload; namely, i added the prof's image in the lectures and converted all to .avi including the source videos. So, if you don't want the source videos just untick them when you download them that's all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe70e8d78ca9a17ef1a4b06a87004b487e7cc0a","amp;dn":"Educator+-+Differential+Equations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe70e8d78ca9a17ef1a4b06a87004b487e7cc0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,231,14,141,120,202,154,23,239,26,75,6,168,112,4,180,135,231,204,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
