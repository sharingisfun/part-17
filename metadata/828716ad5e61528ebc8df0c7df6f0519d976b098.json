After Acclaim Entertainment purchased the rights to the Valiant Character Catalog for $65 million in 1994, the characters continued to appear in many Valiant titles, most prominently in the Eternal Warriors series. Acclaim rebooted the Archer &amp; Armstrong characters to make them more easily adaptable to video games as they are a video game developer and distributor. Valiant Entertainment is the current owner of the Valiant catalog (including Archer &amp; Armstrong). Archer &amp; Armstrong is one of the best selling Valiant titles with total sales in all languages of over 4 million comics and counting.\n\nArcher &amp; Armstrong has been called &quot;The best buddy team book of all time.&quot; by Ain't It Cool News, and &quot;Superhero buddy book of the decade&quot; by Wizard Magazine. Ain't It Cool News also said that &quot;Not since Batman &amp; Robin has a more important duo hit the comic world.&quot;\n\nIn 2008, Valiant released a deluxe hardcover of the Archer &amp; Armstrong origin story, entitled Archer &amp; Armstrong: First Impressions. The hardcover was later named one of the top ten graphic novels of 2008 by Diamond Comic Distributors and one of the best of 2008 by Ain't It Cool News.\n\nArcher is the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest hand-to-hand fighter, an expert marksman and a seeker of righteousness. At age eleven, his corrupt parents attempted to murder him, and succeeded momentarily. But somehow, Archer came back to life, filled with a burning purposeÃ¢â‚¬â€to bring his parents to justice and fight evil such as theirs wherever it flourished. Though he later learns that his parents were finally brought to justice while he was preparing himself by learning the martial arts in a Himalayan monastery, Archer decides to continue with his vow. Armstrong is a ten-thousand-year old libertine, as strong as a battalion, who abandoned naÃƒÂ¯vetÃƒÂ© and idealism millennia ago. Now, he spends his days drinking, carousing, and telling tales of his unbelievable adventures throughout history to anyone who will listenÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not on the run from an ancient cult whose bumbling agents have been hunting him for two thousand years. Armstrong escapes when he can and fights when he has to. The two men eventually meet and become partnersÃ¢â‚¬â€a team chosen by fate to face a truly terrible evil that threatens to destroy the world!\n\nValiant Entertainment has was relaunched in August 2012 and the new ongoing comic series is written by Fred Van Lente and illustrated by Clayton Henry.\n\nArcher &amp; Armstrong v2 (2012): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7514903/ARCHER_AND_ARMSTRONG___01&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7514903/ARCHER_AND_ARMSTRONG___01&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7602623/ARCHER_AND_ARMSTRONG___02&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7602623/ARCHER_AND_ARMSTRONG___02&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7714527/Archer_And_Armstrong_003&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7714527/Archer_And_Armstrong_003&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7825077/Archer_And_Armstrong_004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7825077/Archer_And_Armstrong_004&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828716ad5e61528ebc8df0c7df6f0519d976b098","amp;dn":"Archer+%26amp%3B+Armstrong+v1+%230-26+%281992-1994%29+%28Complete%29+%5BValiant%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828716ad5e61528ebc8df0c7df6f0519d976b098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,135,22,173,94,97,82,142,188,141,240,199,223,111,5,25,217,118,176,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
