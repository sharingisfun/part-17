It is the first feature film by Cellan-Jones, a renowned TV director respected for his work on the BAFTA-winning Our Friends in the North. The film was almost entirely shot on location in Shepherd's Bush, West London, where Cellan-Jones lives. The film has a running time of 101 minutes.\n\n  Daniel Craig  ...

Ray (Craig) is put on medication and placed in the care of brother Pete (Morrissey), the owner of a cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. Walking again through Shepherd's Bush, W London, is uncomfortable, but badgering Pete for a job in the kitchen should give Ray stability, while an encounter with Laura (MacDonald) may open new possibilities. Laura's attracted to Dave because he's direct to the point of foolhardiness, spontaneous and fun to be with. She senses, however, that he's not quite like anyone she's met before. Penhall's adaptation of his play remains an actors' showcase. Morrissey skilfully registers abiding filial love tested by simmering exasperation; MacDonald's adept at lippy on top, vulnerable underneath; and Craig's vibrant yet haunted expressiveness tells us everything needful about this doomed sweetheart. It's thus over-egging it somewhat when the whirling camera effects and freaky sound mix overstates the point that our man really is not well. \n\n'Some Voices' premiered in Directors' Fortnight at Cannes. It was nominated for the 'Golden Hitchcock' Award at the annual Dinard Festival of British Cinema in France. ('Billy Elliot' won the award that year). The first-time director was nominated for the Best Newcomer at the British Academy Awards.\n\nCritics were divided about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Some VoicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Channel 4 called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œone of the best British films of 2000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the directorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision of west LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtower blocks, dual-carriageways and crowded streetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mirroring the central characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgradual disintegrationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nMark Wyman of the Film Review also recommended ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Some VoicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as a film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdefinitely worth seeingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshowcases some terrific British talentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nConversely, Empire called the film, &quot;claustrophobic and corneredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and claimed that it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprobably brought the house down on stage, but on film, it's simply static&quot;.\n\nTotal Film also had doubts. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerhaps itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the quirky, jerky This Life camerawork or the dim, grainy film stock, but Some Voices never reaches out and grabs the audience, remaining a watch rather than an experienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. However, the director did ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdraw intelligent, effective turns from his cast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Daniel Craig and David Morrissey are excellent, while Kelly Macdonald delivers the kind of sweetly sexy performance sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rapidly trade-markingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Special mention was also made of one particular ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbrilliant effectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. As Ray, Daniel CraigÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s central character, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstops taking his tablets, the strange staticky images start to dominate his vision, the odd sounds begin to blot out reality and, gradually, the gulf between the world he experiences and the one everyone else lives in widens disastrously. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a clever and mammothly effective technique, communicating not just the strangeness of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s happening to Ray, but also the sheer terror of itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nTime Out, on the other hand, described this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbrilliant effectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œover-egging it somewhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhirling camera effects and freaky sound mix overstates the point that our man really is not wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Nevertheless, the Time Out reviewer is also complimentary about the acting. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPenhall's adaptation of his play remains an actors' showcase. Morrissey skillfully registers abiding filial love tested by simmering exasperation; MacDonald's adept at lippy on top, vulnerable underneath; and Craig's vibrant yet haunted expressiveness tells us everything needful about this doomed sweetheartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nPeter Bradshaw in The Guardian and Peter Byrne in the Student BMJ (British Medical Journal) are much more unequivocal in their praise. Bradshaw calls the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa serious, substantial, and compassionate movie which demands to be seen, not least for its outstanding performances from an excellent castÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Byrne says that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Some VoicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œworks as a film, and a technically accomplished one at thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nBoth reviewers particularly commend the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s avoidance of clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. Bradshaw stresses that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnothing could be more tiresome and dishonest than shop worn RD Laing-style clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s about schizophrenia being a heightened visionary state which the western world crushes under the jackboot of its dull rationalist enlightenment. Such a proposition would not correspond to the actual experience of schizophrenia sufferers and their carers; in real life, schizophrenia can lead to a lifelong trial of stress and unhappiness, and Some Voices reflects thisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. He also welcomes the fact that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe schizophrenic is not demonised as a potential criminal or as a care-in-the-community basket-caseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRay's essential humanity is transcribed with sympathy and warmth, and so is the patience and perseverance of Pete, who must shoulder most of the burden of schizophrenia's terrible mysteryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Byrne concurs. He writes that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe film is refreshing in its avoidance of the standard formulas. Gone are the psycho-killer, pathetic, or &quot;crazy funny guy&quot; stereotypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ There is no blaming, no mental illness as metaphor, no psychiatry bashing, and - although a romance lies at its core - there is none of the usual message that &quot;love is better than tablets.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de7a3855a99c462cf16c93ee0fe99798ebcab309","amp;dn":"Some+Voices+%5B2000%5D+Daniel+Craig","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de7a3855a99c462cf16c93ee0fe99798ebcab309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,122,56,85,169,156,70,44,241,108,147,238,15,233,151,152,235,202,179,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
