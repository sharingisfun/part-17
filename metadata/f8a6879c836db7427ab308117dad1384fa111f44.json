Alf joined Spawn from 2001 - 2003\n\nThe recording of the debut album &quot;Systems Full Of Victims&quot;,\nwhich was released by Bruchstein records, began immediately\nand the next step towards Spawns concrete idea of Death Metal\nwas taken.\nThe album was presented live at the &quot;Fuck The Commerce IV&quot;\nOpen Air Neiden / Germany, where Spawn gained lots\nof attention for their musical direction: Deep growls, a wall of\nguitars and an incredible battery were kind of an astonishing\nDeath Metal assault.\n\n\nThis lead directly to the Blasphemy And Violence Tour with\nKrisiun and Damnation 2001, where Spawn improved\ntheir Show and took it to the next level.\n\nSplit-Ep &quot;Hybrid Manifestation&quot; with Harmony Dies 02/2002\nApril 2002: Spawn toured again for four weeks in Europe,\ncelebrating The Art Of Sickness together with Cryptopsy,\nHaemorrhage and Profanity; another big success for Spawn.\n\nJanice joined the band for bass from 2004-2009\n\nSpawn recorded their devestating output Human Toxin\nwhich was released in dec. 2004. Human Toxin is another\nintense Death Metal statement of Spawn without any compromises\nand you should expect nothing but a massive slap in your face\nagain! Lots of good reviews declared that SPAWN did it well.\nAfter some deep grinding club gigs, Spawn entered the stage\nof With Full Force Festival in summer 05. After supporting\nArch Enemy/Trivium in Berlin the band rejected itself writing\nthe final chapters for next output. After a refreshing break and\nsplit up with Hardy the band raised the new line up completed\nwith Dirk on the second guitar.\n\nIn 2008 SPAWN entered again the DailyHeroRecord Halls for\ntheir next upcoming CD &quot;The Wicked Reincarnation&quot; which contains 8 Tracks\nlike &quot; Seed of the Doom&quot;, &quot;Nothing than to Kill&quot; or &quot;Under the\nBlackest Sky&quot;\nIn early 2009 Marc ( ex-KADATH ) overtook the deep tunes. After some intense rehearsals SPAWN is prepared again to spread out the vicious intense death metal....\n\nSPAWN split up with Dirk and decided to go on with one guitar.\n\n2013 SPAWN will continue the way of destruction. The Band decided to take control over the whole recording process and established their own studio. 8 Titles are in progress at end 2013.\n\n\nLine-up:\n\nMarc - Bass\nNo. - Drums\nOliver - Guitars\nMatt - Vocals  \n\n\nSpawn - Burning Mighty Empires (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
