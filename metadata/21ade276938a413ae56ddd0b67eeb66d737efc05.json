The group was heavily influenced by The Beatles, Faces, and The Rolling Stones and drew frequent comparisons to Raspberries. Artful Dodger's studio releases received high critical praise, but the band was unable to penetrate the charts.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ade276938a413ae56ddd0b67eeb66d737efc05","amp;dn":"Artful+Dodger+-+Honor+Among+Thieves+%5B1976%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ade276938a413ae56ddd0b67eeb66d737efc05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,173,226,118,147,138,65,58,229,109,221,11,103,238,182,109,115,126,252,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
