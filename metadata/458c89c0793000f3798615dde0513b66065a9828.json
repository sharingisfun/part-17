A Caltech intern inadvertently notices an anomaly from a space telescope - something is approaching Saturn and decelerating. Space objects don't decelerate. Spaceships do.\r\n\r\nA flurry of top-level government meetings produces the inescapable conclusion: Whatever built that ship is at least 100 years ahead in hard and soft technology, and whoever can get their hands on it exclusively and bring it back will have an advantage so large, no other nation can compete. A conclusion the Chinese definitely agree with when they find out.\r\n\r\nThe race is on, and a remarkable adventure begins - an epic tale of courage, treachery, resourcefulness, secrets, surprises, and astonishing human and technological discovery, as the members of a hastily thrown-together crew find their strength and wits tested against adversaries both of this Earth and beyond. What happens is nothing like you expect - and everything you could want from one of the world's greatest masters of suspense.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Eric Conger\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 128 Kbps\r\nUnabridged\r\n\r\n16 hrs and 35 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:458c89c0793000f3798615dde0513b66065a9828","amp;dn":"John+Sandford%2C+Ctein+-+Saturn+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"458c89c0793000f3798615dde0513b66065a9828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,140,137,192,121,48,0,243,121,134,21,221,224,81,59,102,6,90,152,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
