On January 21, 1961, he recorded &quot;Runaway&quot;, released as a single in February 1961. It reached #1 in the Billboard chart in April. Shannon followed with &quot;Hats Off to Larry&quot;, which peaked at #5 (Billboard) and #2 on Cashbox in 1961, and the less popular &quot;So Long, Baby,&quot; another song of breakup bitterness. &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Hats Off to Larry&quot; were recorded in a day\n&quot;Little Town Flirt&quot;, in 1962 (with Bob Babbitt), reached #12 in 1963, as did the album of the same name. After these hits, Shannon was unable to keep his momentum in the U.S., but continued his success in England, where he had always been more popular. In 1963, he became the first American to record a cover version of a Beatles song. &quot;From Me to You&quot; charted in the US before the Beatles.
