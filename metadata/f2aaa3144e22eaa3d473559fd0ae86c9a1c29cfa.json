This concert band Coverdale was part of their &quot;Forevermore World Tour&quot;. Original performance was recorded for Japanese television and the subsequent advertising campaign Loud Park, but after the broadcast of three songs in the main program Loud Park in Japan Whitesnake received unprecedented demand for this performance, and it was decided to make it a major release. Songs of the album &quot;Forevermore&quot; by themselves are recognized as unforgettable classics in this concert all of them better from there. The main program includes the brilliant work of the six-stringed guitar masters Doug Aldrich and Reb Beach, both of which this year celebrated its 10th anniversary as a group. concert itself on the drive comes with a 6-channel audio, and the rest of the content, including video clips with stereo sound. After listening to the test tracks from other Japanese places the group decided to include them in the package as a special bonus content. They decided that all of this would be good to tie the Japan tour 2011. Therefore, it was called the project &quot;Made In Japan&quot;.
