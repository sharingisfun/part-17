The first three chapters provide the general background material, including basic performance equations and practical dynamic models and transfer functions. The rest of the book focuses on the many facets of synchronous generators and is dedicated to electric machine ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f09e2b21a98c2c92c3e68a8a10003ee70a93f06","amp;dn":"Synchronous+Generators+by+ION+BOLDEA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f09e2b21a98c2c92c3e68a8a10003ee70a93f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,9,226,178,26,152,194,201,44,62,104,168,161,0,3,238,112,169,63,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
