But even if you succeed, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doubtful youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find one as clearly positioned for greatness.\n\nJust two years after collectively relocating from Thunder Bay, the pop-rock quintet has issued a massive, sweat-soaked, insanely confident debut, The Heart. The Head. The End. Not only that, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve picked up a record deal, marquee management, a Sirius XM Emerging Artist of the Year nomination and a swelling fan base. Few can make something as tough as pursuing a dream look so dang easy.\n\nTrack List\n1. The Low Road                4:08\n2. Blame It On The Good Times  3:19\n3. Hearts And Minds            3:21\n4. Reckless Young              4:10\n5. Americanist                 2:55\n6. Let It Sleep                3:46\n\nSeed!
