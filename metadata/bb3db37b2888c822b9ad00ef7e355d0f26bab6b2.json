Himself  \n\nMiklos Jancso is possibly the most famous and most highly regarded Hungarian director of all time. His reputation rests on a body of work which makes high intellectual demands of its audience and provokes awkward questions without trying to answer them.\n\nAfter a long period in the doldrums, Miklos Jancso has re-emerged with Nekem lampast adott kezembe az Ur Pesten (The Lord\\'s Lantern in Budapest, 1998), a blackly humorous look at the post-1989 culture of violence that won him the Gene Moskovitz prize from international critics at the Hungarian Film Week in Budapest earlier this year.\n\nThe reception was a mixed one, however, with the Hungarian pre-selection judges for the festival eliminating the film from the competition whilst pushing through what could charitably called masterpieces of the Hungarian new wave of unintented kitsch. They cannot be totally blamed, however. Nekem lampast is almost impenetrably dense in its richness and lacks a plot in any meaningful sense of the term. To understand why it is a masterpiece, the film must be seen in the context of Jancso\\'s career.
