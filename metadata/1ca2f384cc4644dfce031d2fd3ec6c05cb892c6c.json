That said, all of the hallmarks in the band's East Coast hardcore punk sound are still very much in place, and the distinctions between the two records are fairly subtle. Fans who enjoyed the first album will undoubtedly relish this one too, especially in light of the unfortunate fact that it's Kid Dynamite's last -- just prior to Shorter, Faster, Louder's release, vocalist Jason Shevchuk departed to pursue a film career, and the remainder of the band elected to break up.\n(review from allmusic.com by Steve Huey)\n\n\n01 - Pits &amp; Poisoned Apples.mp3\n02 - Death and Taxes.mp3\n03 - Cheap Shot Youth Anthem.mp3\n04 - Copout.mp3\n05 - Handy With TH Tongue Sword.mp3\n06 - Living Day Lights.mp3\n07 - Introduction to the Opposites.mp3\n08 - Gate 68.mp3\n09 - Troy's Bucket.mp3\n10 - Rufus Wants a Hug.mp3\n11 - Got a Minute.mp3\n12 - Penske File.mp3\n13 - Rid of the Losers, Bring on the Crvisers.mp3\n14 - Three's a Party.mp3\n15 - S.O.S..mp3\n16 - Two for Flinching.mp3\n17 - Birthday.mp3\n18 - Give'em the Ripped One.mp3\n\n\nMP3 encoding:\nLAME 3.98, -V 2 --vbr-new\nRipped with EAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ca2f384cc4644dfce031d2fd3ec6c05cb892c6c","amp;dn":"Kid+Dynamite+-+Shorter%2C+Faster%2C+Louder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ca2f384cc4644dfce031d2fd3ec6c05cb892c6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,162,243,132,204,70,68,223,206,3,29,47,211,236,108,5,203,137,44,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
