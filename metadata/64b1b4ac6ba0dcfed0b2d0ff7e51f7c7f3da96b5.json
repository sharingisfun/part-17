Known for solving delicate situations, he is hired to seek out Miss Charlotte Howard. He believes his mission will be easily accomplished - but that was before he met the lady in question.\n\nFor instead of a willful female, he discovers one in desperate circumstances, hiding from a man who could destroy her very soul. So Nick shockingly offers her a very different kind of proposition - one he has never offered before.\n\nHe asks her to be his bride.\n\nAnd he knows that this will be much more than a union in name only. For he senses what Charlotte does not yet know - that her appetite for sensuality matches his own. But what Nick learns surprises him. For while London's most notorious lover might claim Charlotte's body, he quickly discovers it will take much more than passion to win her love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b1b4ac6ba0dcfed0b2d0ff7e51f7c7f3da96b5","amp;dn":"Lisa+Kleypas+-+Worth+Any+Price+%28Bow+Street+Runner++Series+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b1b4ac6ba0dcfed0b2d0ff7e51f7c7f3da96b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,177,180,172,107,160,220,254,208,178,208,255,126,81,247,199,243,218,150,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
