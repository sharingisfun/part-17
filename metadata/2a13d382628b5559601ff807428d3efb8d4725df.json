Stochelo Rosenberg (soloist), Nous'che Rosenberg (rhythm guitar) and Nonnie Rosenberg (double bass). Their inspiration is Django Reinhardt, the legendary gypsy guitarist of the 1930s. The Rosenberg Trio's genre has been characterized as &quot;[swinging, infectious] gypsy guitar jazz&quot;.\n\nThe group has been playing for around 15 years and notable events include the release of a DVD featuring a live recording of a tribute concert to Django Reinhardt, and the 1992 live album The Rosenberg Trio: Live at the North Sea Jazz Festival, which captures the trio at an eclectic, youthful highpoint.\n\nThere is no exact date when the Rosenberg Trio began playing under that name. Two of the Rosenbergs, Nous'che and Nonnie, are sons of Sani Rosenberg, a musician in the Dutch Gypsy community. Being kids of a very musical family they grew up with the music of Django Reinhardt.\n\nNous'che started playing with his cousin and buddy, Stochelo Rosenberg, when Stochelo was about 10 years old.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
