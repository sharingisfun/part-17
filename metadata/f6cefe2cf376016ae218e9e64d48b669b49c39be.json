''Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With'' is a CD/EP \nthat runs over 30 minutes. Anything over 30 minutes qualifies as an album as \nfar as I am concerned, but when your dealing with progressive-rock \nheavyweights like this, 30 minutes is merely a warm up of what is to come, so \nstandby for more soon.\n\nAdrian Belew's voice is present to give the music a distinct flair and the \ninstant recognition of their legacy. I always thought he sounded different \nfrom anyone else in rock, and it worked out as a perfect fit for KING \nCRIMSON's sound. Mastermind Robert Fripp remains at the helm after all \nthese years and his guitar work is consistently outstanding. The beauty and \nsuppleness of &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot; is a huge departure from a rocker like &quot;Lark's \nTongues In Aspic&quot; with its wailing guitar and odd time signatures coupled with \njazz fused overtones. They sound as if they have not missed a step after all \nthese years and remain light years ahead of their contemporaries. The best \npart about their music is their element of surprise, you never know what to \nexpect from track to track, and that is what makes them so intriguing and \nfascinating to listen to.\nReview by Muzikman\nPROG REVIEWER\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6cefe2cf376016ae218e9e64d48b669b49c39be","amp;dn":"King+Crimson+-happy+with+what+you+have+to+be+happy+with+%28EP%29+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6cefe2cf376016ae218e9e64d48b669b49c39be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,206,254,44,243,118,1,106,226,24,233,230,77,72,182,105,180,156,57,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
