I've never heard this album until now, and I have to say I like it. Based on a very short comparison, this vinyl version seems a lot &quot;warmer&quot; and not as ridiculously bright as the cd version, but it does have one strange twist of its own, apart from being seemingly digitally sourced: the audio source seems to have been pretty much cut off at 16kHz... wtf? I know it has nothing to do with my new ripping setup; other vinyls I know well, under the new setup, don't exhibit the 16k cutoff... honestly, who in the chain of command wanted that?!\n\nI wrestled with an off-centre pressing on the second vinyl (Sides C and D), which I attempted to correct by enlarging the hole in the centre of the vinyl. Risky move, I know, but it worked.\n\nSide D got a nasty scratch when I was cleaning it, which resulted in a strange LF thump, which I managed to remove using Adobe Audition's &quot;Center Channel Extractor&quot;.\n\nUnfortunately there's a little bit of inner groove distortion (which I can't stand), but it's bareable (most people probably won't hear it at all).\n\nAll up, this rip is 2 seconds off being exactly the same duration as the CD release, with many tracks being the same length.\n\nMethod:\n1. Ripped using both Adobe Audition 2 (Sides A &amp; B) and Audacity (C &amp; D) to 96kHz, 24bit\n2. Ran DenoiseLF on all sides (-60dB, 100Hz cutoff)\n3. Light Declick in Audition 2 (except side D: Clickrepair v3 @ Declick:25, Reverse, Wavelet x3)\n4. Individual click repair where needed\n5. Individual &quot;thump reduction&quot; using Audition's &quot;Center Channel Extractor&quot; to remove any out of phase noise &lt; 100/250/350Hz (Side D only)\n6. Amplified by 2dB\n7. Edited into tracks using Audition\n8. Tagged with dBpoweramp\n9. Converted to FLAC v1.2.1 (level 8, verified) using dBpoweramp\n\nThanks to Callummc for putting up with my questions and rambling while I wrestled with this vinyl rip, and as always, if you enjoyed it, share it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e78e498496eba8f00eca9d97dcfcf5d657507a8","amp;dn":"Foo+Fighters+-+Echoes%2C+Silence%2C+Patience+%26+Grace+%28Vinyl+Rip+24bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e78e498496eba8f00eca9d97dcfcf5d657507a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,120,228,152,73,110,186,143,0,236,169,217,125,207,207,93,101,117,7,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
