It was first published in 1969 by the Department of the Army. The Improvised Munitions Handbook is one of the best references on how to manufacture improvised explosive devices, and some of the constructions described have been used against U.S. troops themselves.\n\nAmong the weapons described are the hand grenade in a can trap that was used against U.S. troops in Vietnam, and the water in a bucket timer that is used by Afghan guerrillas to launch rockets against U.S. military bases. Also worth noting is the altimeter switch used to ignite a bomb on an aircraft at approximately 5000 ft. Chapters cover the manufacture of explosives and propellants, mines, grenades, small arms weapons, ammunition, mortars, rockets, incendiary weapons, fuses, detonators.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015be8a26d4c536096d3f57bc133252c8e7ea39a","amp;dn":"Improvised+Munitions+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015be8a26d4c536096d3f57bc133252c8e7ea39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,91,232,162,109,76,83,96,150,211,245,123,193,51,37,44,142,126,163,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
