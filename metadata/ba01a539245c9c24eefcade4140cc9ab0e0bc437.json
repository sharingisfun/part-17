The game is set in the world of fantasy, inhabited by humans, beasts, undead ones and other creatures. The universe of the game - Lokatrienn - is expansive and consists of a number of separate worlds. Each one has several cities, which represent isolated economic and political systems. The Hero is able to transit from one world to another through special space Gates, called Portals. His main activity is trade: buying goods in one town and selling or exchanging them in another. Spells of Gold features more than 2000 different types of weapons and armor, plenty of magic, and over 100 cities to visit.\n\nRelease Date: Europe Only\nGenre: RPG\nPublisher: Buka Entertainment\nDeveloper: TBA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba01a539245c9c24eefcade4140cc9ab0e0bc437","amp;dn":"Spells+of+Gold+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba01a539245c9c24eefcade4140cc9ab0e0bc437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,1,165,57,36,92,156,36,238,252,173,228,20,12,201,171,14,11,196,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
