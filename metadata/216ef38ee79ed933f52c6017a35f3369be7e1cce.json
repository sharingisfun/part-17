The film presents the thesis that a selective diet can play a key role in treating a range of health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease and depression, often substituting for medical treatment. Furthermore, it tends to label the medical industry as a &quot;sickness industry&quot;, which profits more from treating the symptoms of illness than curing the illness. The film accuses the medical and pharmaceutical industries of a general conspiracy to perpetuate poor health in order to maximize profits.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:216ef38ee79ed933f52c6017a35f3369be7e1cce","amp;dn":"Food+Matters+English+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"216ef38ee79ed933f52c6017a35f3369be7e1cce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,110,243,142,231,158,217,51,245,44,96,23,163,95,51,105,190,126,28,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
