It was released by Columbia Records on 24 October 2008 as the follow up to her previous English-language compilation, All the Way... A Decade of Song (1999). Before releasing My Love (Essential Collection), Dion had already sold over 200 million albums worldwide. In the album's liner notes, she dedicated this collection of songs, recorded between 1990 and 2008, to her fans who supported her throughout the years. My Love (Essential Collection), was released as a single disc, consisting of Dion's most successful singles, including: &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. The two-disc edition, entitled My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection has been further expanded to include rare songs that have not previously appeared on her albums. Both editions include a new track, &quot;There Comes a Time&quot;. The album wasn't released in Japan because Sony Music Entertainment Japan decided to issue another compilation, Complete Best in February 2008.  My Love: Essential Collection received a positive response. It topped the albums charts in the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland, as well as the compilation album chart in France. The first single from the album, &quot;My Love&quot;, is a semi-autobiographic song written for Dion by Linda Perry, originally available on Taking Chances (2007). In France and later in the United States, &quot;I'm Alive&quot; (Remix) was released as a promotional single..\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Where Does My Heart Beat Now\n[02] Beauty And The Beast (OST) - - - Celine Dion &amp; Peabo Bryson\n[03] If You Asked Me To\n[04] Love Can Move Mountains\n[05] My Love [Live]\n[06] The Power Of Love\n[07] You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman\n[08] Because You Loved Me (OST Theme from &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot;)\n[09] The Power Of The Dream\n[10] It's All Coming Back To Me Now\n[11] All By Myself\n[12] Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore\n[13] Tell Him - - - Celine Dion &amp; Barbra Streisand\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 01h:01m:05s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] River Deep, Mountain High\n[02] One Heart\n[03] I'm Your Angel - - - Celine Dion &amp; R.
