Covering Zevon's most creative period (1976-1982), it contains most of his best known songs. The catchy tunes &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; and &quot;Exciteable Boy&quot; that start things off are perfect Zevon, featuring excellent hooks and truly funny (and horrific) lyrics. And there are other tracks that duplicate these highlights, including &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money,&quot; &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me,&quot; and &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner.&quot; Zevon is a devastatingly talented songwriter who at his best cuts sharply with biting wit and social commentary that isn't heavty handed. Occassionally, with a tune like &quot;Looking for the Next Best Thing,&quot; he can even show a surprising tender side.\n\nOverall, &quot;A Quiet Normal Life&quot; is a terrific introduction to the unique genius that is Warren Zevon.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nWarren Zevon - A Quiet Normal Life: The Best of Warren Zevon\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFLAC:\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3:\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
