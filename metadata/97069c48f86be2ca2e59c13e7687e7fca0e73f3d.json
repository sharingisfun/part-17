To be near to a Master you have to lose your \r\n\r\nego, which is the most difficult thing in the world.\r\n\r\nQ:* WHAT IS DANGEROUS ABOUT THE HUMAN HEART?\r\n\r\nA:* About ego everything is ugly. But the whole society, education, religion -- they all \r\n\r\nteach you ambition, and ambition is nourishment for the ego.\r\n\r\nThe Master's function is to undo whatever the society, religion, culture, has done to \r\n\r\nyou. It is a total deprogramming.\r\n\r\nThe Master brings you back to the innocence in which you were born. And that is the \r\n\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nNobody wants to lose knowledgeability, nobody wants to lose his fame, his \r\n\r\nrespectability....\r\n\r\nQ:* BUT DANGEROUS FOR WHO?\r\n\r\nA:* Dangerous for the ego.....\r\nplease seed sometime, and share","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97069c48f86be2ca2e59c13e7687e7fca0e73f3d","amp;dn":"Osho_The+Last+Testament+Vol-3+%2318","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97069c48f86be2ca2e59c13e7687e7fca0e73f3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,6,156,72,248,107,226,202,46,89,193,62,118,135,231,252,160,231,63,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
