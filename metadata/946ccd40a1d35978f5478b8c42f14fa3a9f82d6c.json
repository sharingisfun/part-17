While this series is tailored to the AP test with plenty of free response type questions at the end of each lecture, college students studying physics will also benefit from the coursesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ detailed explanations. Dr. Jishi also makes sure students fully understand the mathematics involved with a review of trigonometry and vectors. Topics include everything from NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Laws and Conservation of Energy to Thermodynamics, Waves, and Optics. Dr. Jishi earned his Ph.D from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published over 60+ papers in peer-reviewed journals, and has been teaching for over 20 years.\n\nTotal length - 86:03\n\nAP Physics B is an Advanced Placement science course in which high school students study Newtonian mechanics, electricity and magnetism, fluid mechanics and thermal physics, waves and optics, and atomic and nuclear physics in preparation for a cumulative exam given each May. The course is non-calculus-based and involves algebra and trigonometry to solve various physics problems. It is supposed to be equivalent to a year-long introductory college course in physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:946ccd40a1d35978f5478b8c42f14fa3a9f82d6c","amp;dn":"Educator.com+-+AP+Physics+B+with+Professor+Jishi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"946ccd40a1d35978f5478b8c42f14fa3a9f82d6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,108,205,64,161,211,89,120,245,71,139,140,66,241,79,163,169,248,45,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
