But the Africans then residing in the colonies overwhelmingly sided with London. In this trailblazing book, Gerald Horne complements his earlier celebrated Negro Comrades of the Crown, by showing that in the prelude to 1776, the abolition of slavery seemed all but inevitable in London, delighting Africans as much as it outraged slaveholders, and sparking the colonial revolt.\nIn the prelude to 1776, more and more Africans were joining the British military, and anti-slavery sentiments were deepening throughout Britain. And in the Caribbean, rebellious Africans were chasing Europeans to the mainland. Unlike their counterparts in London, the European colonists overwhelmingly associated enslaved Africans with subversion and hostility to the status quo. For European colonists, the major threat to security in North America was a foreign invasion combined with an insurrection of the enslaved. And as 1776 approached, London-imposed abolition throughout the colonies was a very real and threatening possibilityÃ¢â‚¬â€a possibility the founding fathers feared could bring the slave rebellions of Jamaica and Antigua to the thirteen colonies. To forestall it, they went to war.\nThe so-called Revolutionary War, Horne writes, was in large part a counter-revolution, a conservative movement that the founding fathers fought in order to preserve their liberty to enslave othersÃ¢â‚¬â€and which today takes the form of a racialized conservatism and a persistent racism targeting the descendants of the enslaved. The Counter-Revolution of 1776 drives us to a radical new understanding of the traditional heroic creation myth of the United States.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Nearly everything about Gerald HomeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lively The Counter-Revolution of 1776Ã¢â‚¬â€from the questions asked to the comparisons drawnÃ¢â‚¬â€is provocative. And if Professor Home is right, nearly everything American historians thought we knew about the birth of the nation is wrong.&quot;-Woody Holton,author of Forced Founders: Indians, Debtors, Slaves, and the Making of the American Revolution in\n\n&quot;The Counter-Revolution of 1776 shows the centrality of slavery in colonial American life, north as well as south. It demonstrates how enslaved peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s struggles merged with international and imperial politics as the British empire frayed. Gerald Horne finds among white American revolutionaries people who wanted to defend slavery against real threats. He addresses how in the United States, alone among the new western hemisphere republics, slavery thrived rather than waned, until its cataclysmic destruction during the Civil War.&quot;-Edward Countryman,Southern Methodist University\n\n&quot;This utterly original book argues that story of the American Revolution has been told without a major piece of the puzzle in place. The rise of slavery and the British empire created a pattern of imperial war, slave resistance, and arming of slaves that led to instability and, ultimately, an embrace of independence. Horne integrates the British West Indies, Florida, and the entire colonial period with recent work on the Carolinas and Virginia; the result is a larger synthesis that puts slave-based profits and slave restiveness front and center. The Americans re-emerge not just as anti-colonial free traders but as particularly devoted to an emerging color line and to their control over the future of a slavery based economy. A remarkable and important contribution to our understanding of the creation of the United States.&quot;-David Waldstreicher,Temple University\n\n&quot;Horne returns with insights about the American Revolution that fracture even more some comforting myths about the Founding Fathers. The author does not tiptoe through historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grassy fields; he swings a scythe...Clear and sometimes-passionate prose shows us the persistent nastiness underlying our founding narrative.&quot;-Kirkus\n\n&quot;Horne, Moores Professor of history and African-American studies at the University of Houston, confidently and convincingly reconstructs the origin myth of the United States grounded in the context of slavery...HorneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study is rich, not dry; his research is meticulous, thorough, fascinating, and thought-provoking. Horne emphasizes the importance of considering this alternate telling of our American origin myth and how such a founding still affects our nation today.&quot;-Publishers Weekly\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nGerald Horne is Moores Professor of History and African-American Studies at the University of Houston.
