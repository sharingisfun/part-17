Early Pregnancy is the first book to embrace a multidisciplinary approach to this rapidly growing field. It combines the expertise of a wide range of internationally renowned authors to produce an authoritative reference on the subject, aiming to improve patient care in early pregnancy by making key recommendations for clinicians. The chapters cover a wide range of core subjects as well as addressing the latest developments by translating research into clinical practice. By bringing together essential elements of scientific research and clinical care Early Pregnancy sets a new benchmark for evidence-based patient care and will be essential reading for all clinicians, nurses, trainees and scientific researchers with an interest in early pregnancy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b07b55eb2f5fe8f9f31c8d9786338e3f8d53de8b","amp;dn":"Early+Pregnancy+%28Cambridge+Medicine%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b07b55eb2f5fe8f9f31c8d9786338e3f8d53de8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,123,85,235,47,95,232,249,243,28,141,151,134,51,142,63,141,83,222,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
