Their latest, Heartbreak City, has sold close to 5 million copies. No group has brought more style and imagination to rock, and their award-winning videos - directed by such artists as Andy Warhol - are favourites on TV.\nCompiled by ace photographer Phil Kamin (who has travelled extensively with the group), this lavish collection of never-before-published photos shows the Cars on stage and off. Peter Goddard's lively text captures their rise to stardom and fast-lane lifestyle.\nPHILIP KAMIN is an internationally known photographer who has photographed such major pop music figures as David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, and Michael Jackson. PETER GODDARD is the rock and jazz critic for the Toronto Star. Together, they have collaborated on successful illustrated biographies of CyndiLauper, The Who, and others. They live in Toronto, Canada.\n\nCONTENTS\nPrologue 9\n1 Out In Front 10\n2 Ric Ocasek 14\n3 Early Cars 24\n4 Style In Motion 38\n5 Ben Orr 46\n6 Setting The Pace 62\n7 Greg Hawkes 68\n8 Elliot Easton 78\n9 David Robinson 88 \nDiscography 95\nAbou the Authors 96","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd336cf2e2d40a354ab1652f36cdf7bb3620e1da","amp;dn":"The+Cars+%28A+Photobiography%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd336cf2e2d40a354ab1652f36cdf7bb3620e1da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,51,108,242,226,212,10,53,74,177,101,47,54,205,247,187,54,32,225,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
