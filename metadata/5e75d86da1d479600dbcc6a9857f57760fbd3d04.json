M. ABRAHAM, WALTER A. VAN\nSCHALKWIJK, ET AL\n\nBOOK\n\nExplains the current state of the science and points the way to\ntechnological advances\n\nFirst developed in the late 1980s, lithium-ion batteries now\npower everything from tablet computers to power tools to electric\ncars. Despite tremendous progress in the last two decades in the\nengineering and manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, they are\ncurrently unable to meet the energy and power demands of many new\nand emerging devices. This book sets the stage for the\ndevelopment of a new generation of higher-energy density\nrechargeable lithium-ion batteries by advancing battery chemistry\nand identifying new electrode and electrolyte materials\n\nThe first chapter of Lithium Batteries sets the foundation for\nthe rest of the book with a brief account of the history of\nlithium-ion battery development. Next, the book covers such\ntopics as:\nAdvanced organic and ionic liquid electrolytes for battery\napplications\nAdvanced cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries\nMetal fluorosulphates capable of doubling the energy density of\nlithium-ion batteries\nEfforts to develop lithium-air batteries\nAlternative anode rechargeable batteries such as magnesium and\nsodium anode systems\n\nEach of the sixteen chapters has been contributed by one or more\nleading experts in electrochemistry and lithium battery\ntechnology. Their contributions are based on the latest published\nfindings as well as their own firsthand laboratory experience\nFigures throughout the book help readers understand the concepts\nunderlying the latest efforts to advance the science of batteries\nand develop new materials. Readers will also find a bibliography\nat the end of each chapter to facilitate further research into\nindividual topics\n\nLithium Batteries provides electrochemistry students and\nresearchers with a snapshot of current efforts to improve battery\nperformance as well as the tools needed to advance their own\nresearch efforts\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e75d86da1d479600dbcc6a9857f57760fbd3d04","amp;dn":"WILEY.LITHIUM.BATTERIES.ADVANCED.TECHNOLOGIES.AND.APPLICATIONS.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e75d86da1d479600dbcc6a9857f57760fbd3d04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,117,216,109,161,212,121,96,13,188,198,169,133,127,87,118,15,189,61,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
