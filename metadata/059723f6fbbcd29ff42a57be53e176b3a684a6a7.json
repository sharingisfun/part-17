Released in 1987 , it was well-received by critics and topped the American Billboard 200 chart. As of September 2008, the album has been certified diamond (plus 18x platinum) by the RIAA, accumulating worldwide sales in excess of twenty-eight million as of October 2008. The album still remains the fastest-selling debut album in history.\n \nTrack listing\nSide 1\n1. Welcome To The Jungle (4:34)\n2. It's So Easy (3:23)\n3. Nightrain (4:29)\n4.
