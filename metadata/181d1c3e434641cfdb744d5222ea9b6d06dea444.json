To appreciate the\nfunctionality of the operating system and the design issues involved, one must have\nsome appreciation for computer organization and architecture. Chapter 1 provides\na brief survey of the processor, memory, and Input/Output (I/O) elements of a com-\nputer system.\n\nChapter 2 Operating System Overview\nThe topic of operating system (OS) design covers a huge territory, and it is easy to\nget lost in the details and lose the context of a discussion of a particular issue.\nChapter 2 provides an overview to which the reader can return at any point in the\nbook for context. We begin with a statement of the objectives and functions of an\noperating system. Then some historically important systems and OS functions are\ndescribed. This discussion allows us to present some fundamental OS design princi-\nples in a simple environment so that the relationship among various OS functions is\nclear. The chapter next highlights important characteristics of modern operating sys-\ntems. Throughout the book, as various topics are discussed, it is necessary to talk\nabout both fundamental, well-established principles as well as more recent innova-\ntions in OS design. The discussion in this chapter alerts the reader to this blend of\nestablished and recent design approaches that must be addressed. Finally, we pre-\nsent an overview of Windows, UNIX, and Linux; this discussion establishes the gen-\neral architecture of these systems, providing context for the detailed discussions to\nfollow.\n\n...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:181d1c3e434641cfdb744d5222ea9b6d06dea444","amp;dn":"Operating+Systems+-+William+Stalling+-+6th+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"181d1c3e434641cfdb744d5222ea9b6d06dea444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,29,28,62,67,70,65,207,219,116,77,82,34,234,155,109,6,222,164,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
