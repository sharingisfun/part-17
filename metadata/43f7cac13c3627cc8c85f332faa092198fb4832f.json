He does not just study the dead to solve criminal cases, he does it to solve the mystery that has eluded him for 200 yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€the answer to his own inexplicable immortality (Every time he dies, he returns to life a few hours later, emerging from a nearby body of water, completely naked and with no memory of the intervening time). This long life has given Henry remarkable observation skills which impresses his new partner, Detective Jo Martinez (Alana De La Garza). Each week, a new case and their budding friendship will reveal layers of Henry's long and colorful past. Only his best friend and confidant, Abe (Judd Hirsch) knows Henry's secret.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f7cac13c3627cc8c85f332faa092198fb4832f","amp;dn":"Forever.2014.S01E01.Xvid-AJAXEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f7cac13c3627cc8c85f332faa092198fb4832f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,247,202,193,60,54,39,204,140,133,243,50,250,160,146,25,143,180,131,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
