It consists of Dylan's first eight studio albums in mono on nine compact discs, the album Blonde on Blonde being issued on two discs in its original vinyl format. It includes a 56-page booklet with photographs, discographical information, and an essay by Greil Marcus.\n\nMono was the playback medium for most record players, car radios, and transistor radios during the 1960s. Stereo playback systems had been available since the late 1950s, but the equipment and the albums mixed to play on them were expensive, and the music industry continued to manufacture mono albums and singles through the decade. Monophonic as a format would not be discontinued in both the United States and the United Kingdom until approximately 1969. As stated in the liner notes by Marcus,\n\nThis box collects Bob Dylan's first eight 12-inch LPs...as most people heard them, as they were expected to be heard, and as most often they were meant to be heard: in mono.\n\nMoreover, the mixing of the album in mono was the chief priority of Dylan and his producers. Stereo was almost an afterthought. Producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of the The Original Mono Recordings was told by Bob Johnston about the mixing of Blonde on Blonde: &quot;We mixed that mono probably for three or four days, then I said, 'Oh shit, man, we gotta do stereo.' So me and a coupla guys put our hands on the board, we mixed that son of a bitch in about four hours!... So my point is, it took a long time to do the mono, and then it was, 'Oh, yeah, we gotta do stereo'.&quot;\n\nMost of the albums were mastered from the original, first-generation master tapes. Only two albums were not: The Times They Are A-Changin' and Highway 61 Revisited. The original master tape for the former could not be found so a new master was mixed from the original three-track tape, using the original vinyl pressing as a guide. Highway 61 Revisited was mastered from a second-generation overseas copy of the mono mix.\n\nThe genuine mono mix for John Wesley Harding was presumably released only in the U.S., whereas the original mono LP issued in the U.K. was apparently a fold-down of the stereo master. For The Original Mono Recordings box set, the producers used the genuine mono mix issued in the U.S.\n\nInitial purchase of the box allowed for free download of the non-album single &quot;Positively Fourth Street&quot; in mono (Bitrate=320kbps), which is included in the torrent.\n\nPre-Orders from bobdylan.com also came with a Bonus Disc: Bob Dylan In Concert at Brandeis University, recorded on Saturday, May 10, 1963. This is also included in this torrent.\n\nThe original recordings were produced by John Hammond, Tom Wilson, and Bob Johnston.\n\nAlbum Listing:\n\nBob Dylan (originally released March 19, 1962)\n \n1. &quot;You're No Good&quot;   Jesse Fuller 1:40 \n2. &quot;Talkin' New York&quot;   Bob Dylan 3:20 \n3. &quot;In My Time of Dyin'&quot;   trad. arr.
