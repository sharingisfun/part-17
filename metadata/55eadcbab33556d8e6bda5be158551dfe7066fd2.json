But trouble is brewing with Barney and Scarlet's       \n      marriage and Cleaver is the meat in the sandwich. After their      \n     recent heart to heart, Scarlet turns up at Cleaver's fl at and      \n      hints at an affair, hiding when Barney arrives a few minutes       \n       later. Meanwhile, Cleaver and Barney take on a case of jury       \n    tampering, where Lucy Marx, an attractive 40-year-old - a detail     \n      that doesn't go unnoticed by Cleaver - has made headlines by       \n      seducing a juror for information after her daughter is found       \n    guilty of murder. But Cleaver is left reeling when Missy turns up    \n    at a restaurant on the arm of his nemesis David Potter, who later    \n    makes headlines himself when he tackles a gunman, gets shot, and     \n   becomes a 'hero'. Meanwhile, Cleaver reluctantly agrees to let his    \n    son Fuzz use his flat for assignations with his girlfriend, while    \n    Fuzz's mum is kept in the dark. Barney, convinced that Lucy Marx     \n    is right about her daughter's innocence, sets off to unearth the     \n     real murderer, but doesn't quite get the result he was looking      \n   for. With a tip-off from his prosecutor wife Scarlet, Barney warns    \n        Cleaver that Lucy Marx is using him. As Cleaver tries to         \n      manipulate the court case, his relationship with Lucy Marx is      \n   revealed, and makes him, yet again, the target of investigation by    \n      the Bar Association. As he drowns his sorrows in a local bar,      \n      Cleaver looks up to see Scarlet standing outside in the rain       \n     looking at him longingly. Can life get any more complicated for     \n                             Cleaver Greene?                             \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                    &lt;a href=&quot;
