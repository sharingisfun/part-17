When a medical committee rejects his findings and orders him to discontinue his work, the unstable doctor does the only sensible thing: slashing his wrists in the bathroom. The devastated Miranda then takes it upon herself to seduce and kill the three men and one woman &quot;responsible&quot; for the suicide. Of course, two of the potential victims include Dr. Orloff himself, Howard Vernon, and Franco in one of his largest roles.\n\n \n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name: She.Killed.In.Ecstasy.1971.DVDRip.XviD\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration: 1:13:54\nVideo Bitrate: 1289kb/s\nBits / Pixel: 0.217\nResolution: 672x368\nAspect Ratio: 1.826\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066104/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066104/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf967781510b9105a7c786d196e5c8369b2f4b0c","amp;dn":"She.Killed.In.Ecstasy.1971.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf967781510b9105a7c786d196e5c8369b2f4b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,150,119,129,81,11,145,5,167,199,134,209,150,229,200,54,155,47,75,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
