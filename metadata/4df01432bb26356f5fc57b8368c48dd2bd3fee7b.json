An Indo-Anglian writer, Singh was best known for his trenchant secularism, his humour, and an abiding love of poetry. His comparisons of social and behavioural characteristics of Westerners and Indians are laced with acid wit. He served as the editor of several literary and news magazines, as well as two newspapers, through the 1970s and 1980s. He was the recipient of Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award in India.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Delhi\n\n* The Good, the Bad and the Ridiculous\n\n* I Shall Not Hear The Nightingale\n\n* Land of Five Rivers\n\n* Train To Pakistan\n\n* Truth, Love &amp; A Little Malice\n\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khushwant_Singh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khushwant_Singh&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/khushwant-singh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/20/khushwant-singh&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21600081-khushwant-singh-indias-pre-eminent-gadfly-died-march-20th-aged-99-indias-gadfly&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21600081-khushwant-singh-indias-pre-eminent-gadfly-died-march-20th-aged-99-indias-gadfly&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df01432bb26356f5fc57b8368c48dd2bd3fee7b","amp;dn":"Khushwant+Singh+-+Fiction+%26amp%3B+Non-Fiction+%286+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df01432bb26356f5fc57b8368c48dd2bd3fee7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,240,20,50,187,38,53,111,95,197,123,131,104,196,141,210,189,63,238,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
