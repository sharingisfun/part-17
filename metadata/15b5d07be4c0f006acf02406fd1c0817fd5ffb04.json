Although this does not compare to some of the other live concerts the music is playable, nothing is going to make a greatest hits list, but I have listened to the album half a dozen times and my Jazz collection is 200 plus albums.  The other version of this same concert with the exact same tracks can be found here:  Take 5 Quartet:  A Jazz Hour With Dave Brubeck Quartet.  Track 9 is a bonus track which was recorded January 28, 1983, Cannes, France. ~ Skylark Poems\n\nPersonnel:\nDave Brubeck - piano \nBill Smith - clarinet \nChris Brubeck - bass \nRandy Jones - drums \n\nDave Brubeck - Live in Montreux Tracks:\n01  Tritonis 8:39\n02  Koto Song 10:29 \n03  Improvisation 6:21 (composition by Dave Brubeck) \n04  Ol' Bill Basie 5:36 \n05  What did I do to be so black and blue 7:54 \n06  Take five 8:30 \n07  Benjamin Christopher David Brubeck 7:24 \n08  Blue rondo a la Turk 6:01\n09  Lover Man\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b5d07be4c0f006acf02406fd1c0817fd5ffb04","amp;dn":"Dave+Brubeck+-+Live+in+Montreux+%281982%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b5d07be4c0f006acf02406fd1c0817fd5ffb04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,181,208,123,228,192,240,6,172,240,36,6,253,28,8,23,253,95,251,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
