It's intended as a fun homage to one of my favourite filmmakers, and a remix of one of the best films ever made. Steering away from the Tarantino vibe, I have also included a hero moment for most of the main characters, and thrown in a few songs that Tarantino would never use in a million years... Hope you enjoy it!\n\nAdditional Notes:\nVersion 2\n- released August 2014. \n- Significantly reduced John Williams' music spill present in V1, and as a result, was able to better integrate new music with existing dialogue. \n- Minor visual tweaks/fixes.\n\nOther Sources:\nFootage:\nStar Wars, Episodes 2-6\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2D animated series, 2002)\n\nMusic:\nKill Bill Vol. 1\nIronside (Excerpt) - Quincy Jones \nThe Grand Duel (Parte Prima) - Louis Bacalov \nThe Lonely Shepherd - Zamfir \nThe Flower of Carnage - Meiko Kaji \nCrane/White Lightning - The RZA \nSuper 16 - Neu! \nRun Fay Run - Isaac Hayes \n\nKill Bill Vol. 2 \nSummertime Killer - Luis Bacalov \nA Silhouette of Doom - Ennio Morricone \nIl Tramanto - Ennio Morricone \nThe Chase - Alan Reeves \nL'Arena - Ennio Morricone \n\nInglourious Basterds \nThe Green Leaves Of Summer - Nick Perito \nThe Surrender (La resa) - Ennio Morricone \nThe Verdict - Ennio Morricone \nRabbia e Tarantella - Ennio Morricone \nSlaughter (Album Version) -Billy Preston \nTiger Tank - Lalo Schifrin \nThe Man With The Big Sombrero - S.
