The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by Time Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be somewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and science-oriented than magazines like Popular Science. Discover was left largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, but nevertheless decided to appeal to a wider audience, including more articles on psychology and psychiatry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc50839261def7d4afca3822ec8e0abf4075470e","amp;dn":"Discover+Magazine+-+September+2011+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc50839261def7d4afca3822ec8e0abf4075470e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,80,131,146,97,222,247,212,175,202,56,34,236,142,10,191,64,117,71,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
