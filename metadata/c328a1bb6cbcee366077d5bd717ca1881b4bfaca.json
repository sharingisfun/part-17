Whereas the majority of up and coming British bands are either retro-pop (ÃƒÂ  la Oasis), trip-hop (Portishead), or space rock (the Verve, Radiohead), Gomez is one of the few to contain bluesy elements in their rock. Their debut for Virgin Records, Bring It On, was praised in the rock press on both sides of the Atlantic. They also received the distinguished Mercury Music Prize for 1998 Album of the Year in England, where they edged out such stiff competition as Massive Attack's Mezzanine and the Verve's Urban Hymns. They completed their inaugural U.S. tour opening for Eagle Eye Cherry in October 1998, while the press still offered praise -- Spin magazine called Bring It On &amp;quot;a damn beautiful album,&amp;quot; giving it an eight out of ten rating. Liquid Skin followed in 1999 and the rarities and B-sides compilation Abandoned Shopping Trolley Hotline was issued a year later. A third studio album, In Our Gun, appeared in spring 2002. Another hiatus saw Ian Ball relocating to Los Angeles, while still working with the band at their new studio in Portslade, England. The dozens of tracks recorded during this time were whittled down and fashioned into Split the Difference, released in May of 2004.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c328a1bb6cbcee366077d5bd717ca1881b4bfaca","amp;dn":"Gomez+Complete+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c328a1bb6cbcee366077d5bd717ca1881b4bfaca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,40,161,187,108,188,238,54,96,119,213,189,113,124,161,136,27,75,250,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
