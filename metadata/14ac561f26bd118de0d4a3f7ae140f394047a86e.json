Their debut single, &quot;Buses and Trains&quot;, was an international hit, but subsequent releases only impacted Australian charts.\n\nThe band split in 2003 after the release of their second album. A third album had been recorded, but was not released. 4 tracks from that abandoned project were released in 2011 on the compilation album Loved &amp; Lost: The Best Of Bachelor Girl. Tania Doko stated in interviews that the band didn't feel there was enough material from their two albums to fill a greatest hits album, and decided to use cuts from the previously unreleased third album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14ac561f26bd118de0d4a3f7ae140f394047a86e","amp;dn":"Bachelor+Girl+-+Loved+%26+Lost%3A+The+Best+Of+%28Album%29+320kbps+%5B2011%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14ac561f26bd118de0d4a3f7ae140f394047a86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,172,86,31,38,189,17,141,224,212,163,247,174,20,15,57,64,71,168,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
