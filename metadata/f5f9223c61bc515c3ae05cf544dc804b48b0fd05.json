Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for Apple's iOS in December 2009. Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from Apple's App Store, which has prompted the company to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, such as those using the Android operating system, among others. Rovio Mobile has supported Angry Birds with numerous free updates that add additional game content, and the company has even released stand-alone holiday versions of the game.\n\nAngry Birds has been praised for its successful combination of addictive gameplay, comical style, and low price. Its popularity led to versions of Angry Birds being created for personal computers and gaming consoles, a market for merchandise featuring its characters and even long-term plans for a feature film or television series. With over 50 million downloads across all platforms, the game has been called &quot;one of the most mainstream games out right now&quot; and &quot;one of the great runaway hits of 2010&quot;.\n\n\nPLEASE SEED DONT JUST HIT AND RUN!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f9223c61bc515c3ae05cf544dc804b48b0fd05","amp;dn":"Angry+Birds+Game+For+The+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f9223c61bc515c3ae05cf544dc804b48b0fd05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,249,34,60,97,188,81,92,58,224,92,245,68,220,128,75,72,176,253,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
