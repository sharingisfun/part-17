In a study based on impressive multinational research, David Paull Nickles examines the critical impact of the telegraph on the diplomacy of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nCase studies in crisis diplomacy--the War of 1812, the Trent affair during the U.S. Civil War, and the famous 1917 Zimmermann telegram--introduce wide-ranging thematic discussions on the autonomy of diplomats; the effects of increased speed on decision making and public opinion; the neglected role of clerks in diplomacy; and the issues of expense, garbled text, espionage, and technophobia that initially made foreign ministries wary of telegraphy. Ultimately, the introduction of the telegraph contributed to the centralization of foreign ministries and the rising importance of signals intelligence. The faster pace of diplomatic disputes invited more emotional decisions by statesmen, while public opinion often exercised a belligerent influence on crises developing over a shorter time period.\nUnder the Wire offers a fascinating new perspective on the culture of diplomacy and the social history of technology.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nTelegraphy, which conferred the ability to send messages at great speed across vast distances, &quot;had the potential to transform diplomacy,&quot; writes Nickles, and, as a historian at the Department of State, he is well situated to explore how these transformations were received by the generally conservative corps of American diplomats. In this volume, Nickles examines three cases from diplomatic history. First, he looks at a pre-telegraphy incident, the War of 1812, and concludes, contrary to common assumptions, that telegraphy did not always deprive diplomats abroad of their autonomy. The Trent affair of 1861, when telegraphy was still relatively new, illuminates how the speed of telegraphy affected the speed of decision-making and its impact on the &quot;aristocratic, leisurely world of diplomacy.&quot; Finally, the case of the infamous Zimmermann telegram of WWI explores, among other issues, the vulnerability of telegraphy to espionage. This fascinating but somewhat specialized study will interest primarily students of diplomatic history and of the impact of technological change on society.\nCopyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.\n\nFrom Booklist\nNickles examines the impact of the telegraph on diplomacy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His inquiry centers on three incidents: the War of 1812, the Trent affair during the Civil War, and Britain's decoding and exploitation of the Zimmermann telegram of 1917. Nickles' narratives illustrate the way delay could either provoke or prevent a war, an option that the telegraph closed. Indeed the way the device led to centralization and fed bureaucracy annoyed the leisurely, aristocratic diplomats of late-nineteenth-century Europe, whose cultivated lassitude toward work Nickles well evokes in his anecdotes. Their snobbery elevated them above such plebian concerns as cipher security. Depicting how archaic factions resist change provides a popular hook to Nickles' study, which will strongly interest aspirants to careers in the foreign service.
