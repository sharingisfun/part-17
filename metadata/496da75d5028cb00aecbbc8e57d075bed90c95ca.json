Unable to use a conventional kitchen, Hackett has no choice but to use machine shop tools to prep and cook his fast food. To industrialize the French Fry making process, he uses an oversized potato cannon and a hot water heater. Without a heat source to cook his burgers, Hackett is forced to turn to science. Using an unconventional recipe of rust and metal, Hackett creates a 5000-degree fire to cook his burgers. All of this industrialization equates to one thing, a Hackett Burger Value Meal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496da75d5028cb00aecbbc8e57d075bed90c95ca","amp;dn":"Stuck.with.Hackett.S01E06.Really.Freaking.Fast.Food.HDTV.XviD-tN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496da75d5028cb00aecbbc8e57d075bed90c95ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,109,167,93,80,40,203,0,174,203,188,142,87,208,117,190,217,12,149,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
