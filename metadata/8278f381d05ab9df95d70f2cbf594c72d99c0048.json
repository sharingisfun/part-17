He likes Gage but the intense attraction between them makes remaining just friends unlikely, and the young farmer with two small children is a complication Trent doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need. \n\nDespite all the reasons to stay away, Trent is pulled into the small family. GageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boys are delightful and the young manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s honesty and genuine affection impossible to resist. Trent is intrigued by a life so different from everything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known. As he struggles to reconcile his plans with his feelings Trent begins to suspect that his random offer of a ride in the rain might lead straight to his last first kiss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8278f381d05ab9df95d70f2cbf594c72d99c0048","amp;dn":"Last+First+Kiss+-+Diane+Adams+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8278f381d05ab9df95d70f2cbf594c72d99c0048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,120,243,129,208,90,185,223,149,215,15,44,191,89,76,114,217,156,0,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
