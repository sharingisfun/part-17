Supposedly, the millennium is a momentous occasion, but it's hard to feel that way when it's used as another excuse to turn out a budget-line series. But apart from the presumptuous title, 20th Century Masters -- The Millennium Collection turns out to be a very good budget-line series. True, it's impossible for any of these brief collections to be definitive, but they're nevertheless solid samplers and don't feature a bad song in the bunch. For example, take Martha Reeves &amp; the Vandellas' 20th Century volume -- it's an irresistible budget-priced summary of their prime Motown recordings. There may be a couple of noteworthy songs missing, but many of their best-known songs are here, including &quot;Nowhere to Run,&quot; &quot;Heatwave,&quot; &quot;Jimmy Mack,&quot; and &quot;Dancing in the Street.&quot; Serious fans will want something more extensive, but this is an excellent introduction for neophytes and a great sampler for casual fans, considering its length and price. That doesn't erase the ridiculousness of the series title, but the silliness is excusable when the music and the collections are good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da9fa043eef266553f2837fdce5be056a4926b1","amp;dn":"The+Millennium+Collection%3A+The+Best+of+Martha+Reeves+%26+the+Vande","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da9fa043eef266553f2837fdce5be056a4926b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,169,250,4,62,239,38,101,83,242,131,127,220,229,190,5,106,73,38,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
