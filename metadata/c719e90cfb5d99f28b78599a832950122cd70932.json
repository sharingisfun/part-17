Join Eric Hovind for six fascinating sessions:\n\nSession 1: They\\'re Both Religions\nIs evolution science or religion? Nothing about evolution belongs in the category of science.\n\nSession 2: How Old Is It?\nDo we really know that the earth is ancient? The truth is that the evidence points strongly to a young earth.\n    \nSession 3: It Was Good\nDid man really live to be hundreds of years old before the flood? What about dinosaurs and giant men? Why is there suffering? Creationism accounts for all of this.\n\nSession 4: Dinosaurs With Man\nEvidence for dinosaurs in modern history is abundant. Historical and Biblical records substantiate the theory that dinosaurs lived with man.\n\nSession 5: Fact vs. Faith\nPerspective determines everything. Facts are absolute, but interpretation changes with the individual.\n    \nSession 6: The Truth\nSome things are self-evidently true. Atheistic Evolutionists have to deny logic itself in order to argue against such obvious truth.\n\nBeginnings is a creation experience for small groups, churches, and individuals from all walks of life. Creation Speaker, Eric Hovind, explores the age-old questions of life, the evidence for a young earth, and how dinosaurs fit in with the Bible. The included guide provides an introduction to each lesson, creative challenges, great discussion questions, and practical ways to apply each lesson to everyday life!\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c719e90cfb5d99f28b78599a832950122cd70932","amp;dn":"Beginnings+-+DVDs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c719e90cfb5d99f28b78599a832950122cd70932","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,25,233,12,251,93,153,242,139,120,89,154,131,41,80,18,44,215,9,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
