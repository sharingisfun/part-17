Der TragÃƒÂ¶die erster Teil (translated as: Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy) and Faust. Der TragÃƒÂ¶die zweiter Teil (Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy). Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is Goethe's most famous work and considered by many to be one of the greatest works of German literature.\nGoethe completed a preliminary version of Part One in 1806. The 1808 publication was followed by the revised 1828Ã¢â‚¬â€œ29 edition, which was the last to be edited by Goethe himself. Prior to these appeared a partial printing in 1790 of Faust, a Fragment. The earliest forms of the work, known as the Urfaust, were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are no longer entirely clear.\nGoethe finished writing Faust Part Two in 1831. In contrast to Faust Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe's last years. It appeared only posthumously in 1832.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba061aac5522cdabf88532e7560b59f3c37ecce","amp;dn":"Faust+by+Johann+Wolfgang+von+Goethe+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba061aac5522cdabf88532e7560b59f3c37ecce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,160,97,170,197,82,44,218,191,136,83,46,117,96,181,159,60,55,236,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
