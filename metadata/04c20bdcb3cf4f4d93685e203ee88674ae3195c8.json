Now fully updated, this book discusses the underlying physical assumptions for three basic MHD models: ideal, kinetic, and double-adiabatic MHD. Included are detailed analyses of MHD equilibrium and stability, with a particular focus on three key configurations at the cutting-edge of fusion research: the tokamak, stellarator, and reversed field pinch. Other new topics include continuum damping, MHD stability comparison theorems, neoclassical transport in stellarators, and how quasi-omnigeneity, quasi-symmetry, and quasi-isodynamic constraints impact the design of optimized stellarators. Including full derivations of almost every important result, in-depth physical explanations throughout, and a large number of problem sets to help master the material, this is an exceptional resource for graduate students and researchers in plasma and fusion physics.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 727 pages\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press (August 11, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1107006252\nISBN-13: 978-1107006256\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04c20bdcb3cf4f4d93685e203ee88674ae3195c8","amp;dn":"Ideal+MHD+%282014%29+by+Jeffrey+P.+Freidberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04c20bdcb3cf4f4d93685e203ee88674ae3195c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,194,11,220,179,207,79,77,147,104,94,32,62,232,134,116,174,49,149,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
