All of the players have consistently created monuments of aural\nsplendour. This time out is no exception. There is a constant shift of emphasis\nand shade, subtlety and emphasis, momentum balanced with reflection.\n\nIn the midst of all this comes the blowing &quot;Koala #2 (Reduction), which has\nseveral factors going for it. Jason Mears lopes in on the alto sax, casting a\nsturdy path that dazzles in its swift change of direction and the switch of pace\nand enunciation. Jeb Bishop's trombone is an articulate messenger in finding\nintriguing nooks. Jeff Parker's guitar beckons with its melodic fervour. At the\nbottom of it all is Jason Roebke, his bass a stimulus with its varied pulse and\ninterplay.\n\nThe take on &quot;And A Hard Place is free expression skittering in on Eisenstadt's\ndrumming. Sound jiggles and dances before the horns stomp in. Which way will\nthey band now go? Will there be meter and time? Will the beat be paced\nuniformly? The answer comes from Bishop, now playing a melody that has body and\nshape. This sparks off a looser ambit from Mears, who soon gears the shift into\nharder terrain. It is all conceptualized logically enough, the different strands\nfinally forming a pulsating whole.\n\n&quot;Three Breaths comes with greater latitude in freedom. Mears and Bishop get\ninvolved in quirky structures, countenancing each other with short jabs and\ncurlicues. They bring in an equilibrium but that soon dissipates as the others\ntake their own strands of thought, seemingly in different directions before\nfinding the apex.\n\nThe road to discovery is a constant adventure, making The Soul and Gone a\nstimulating record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd074bf396557e18b3561eee7f19a9ed3d56c9d","amp;dn":"Harris+Eisenstadt+-+The+Soul+and+Gone+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd074bf396557e18b3561eee7f19a9ed3d56c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,208,116,191,57,101,87,225,139,53,97,238,231,241,154,158,211,213,108,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
