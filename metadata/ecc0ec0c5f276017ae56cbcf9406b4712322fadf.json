PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND:\nA HISTORY OF THE BEATLE YEARS 1962-1970\nProduced for Westwood One and presented by Roger Scott\nRemasters Workshop\nRMW 918-923\n\nThanks to the generosity of a collector who wishes to remain anonymous, we are happy to be able to present a fresh transfer of the 24 sides of this iconic radio series from October 1984, directly from a pristine set of the original Westwood One albums. \n\nBy leaving out the commercials, the program was able to fit on six CDs. The results sound slightly better than the records, because a lot of the sound sources are from tape, each of which had a different degree of azimuth miscalibration during playback. With the phase corrected, they sound pretty much exactly like they ought to. The pitch of each piece of music has been corrected, where possible. Not only were all the clicks removed from the records, but also from vinyl sources they used in the program for interview excerpts (such as Brian Epstein).\n\nThis show was not publicized by Westwood One, very likely due to the inclusion of 40-odd unreleased recordings spread among the obligatory EMI tracks. Neither was it reviewed in trade publications. Limited broadcasts of the program were the source of quite a few tracks that turned up on Beatles bootlegs between 1985 and 1988. The first of these was &quot;Not For Sale&quot; on the NEMS label, sourced from a tape of an airing in Los Angeles. The show was bootlegged in its entirety on a vinyl set by Yellow Dog (before they used that name) out of Europe (blue box, blank labels), which serves as the source for a CD-R set on the Black Cat label. One of the discs in that set is corrupted due to faulty extraction, and all of them suffer from the clicks and pops on the records and ground hum from the turntable's cartridge.\n\nBy 1988, copies of Roger Scott's source tapes (which he obtained from visits to EMI with engineer John Barrett) had found their way to bootleggers, and were released as &quot;Ultra Rare Trax&quot; and &quot;Unsurpassed Masters,&quot; in dribs and drabs on such titles as &quot;Control Room Monitor Mixes&quot; and eventually as &quot;The Barrett Tapes&quot; in several different configurations and under several titles.\n\nHere are the contents:\n\nDISC 1\n01 Billboard 1\n02 End credits\n03 Billboard 2\n04 Forward promo\n05 Side 1 (12:25)\nIntro / SEARCHIN' (Decca Tapes) / Brian Epstein / MY BONNIE / Brian Epstein / MONEY (That's What I Want) (Decca Tapes)\n06 Side 2 (22:54)\nONE AFTER 909 (Cavern) / CATSWALK (excerpt) (Cavern) / George Martin / LOVE OF THE LOVED (Decca Tapes) / George Martin / BESAME MUCHO (Decca Tapes) / Brian Epstein / SOME OTHER GUY (Cavern, acetate) / LONG TALL SALLY (Star Club) / Paul / Pete Best / Ringo / CAROL (BBC)\n07 Side 3 (15:17)\nLOVE ME DO (Ringo drums) / P.S.
