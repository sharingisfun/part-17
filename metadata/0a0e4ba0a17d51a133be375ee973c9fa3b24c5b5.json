There are about six hundreds pages, with probably over 1,000 artists listed. The left side page has brief bios with some artist quotes (there are from 2-3 artists per page), and the right side (facing page) has the art. Some of the art is really good and reproduced at a decent size. Other images are too small to really get good detail. It's fun to flip through the pages and find entries for guys like Howard Terpning, David Wright and Tom Lovell way back when. I find myself going to the computer to look many of the artists up, surprised to find that many of them have websites and are still painting or sculpting. Others have passed on already. I take off one star because some of the artists felt the need to tell everyone of their religious beliefs. As someone who doesn't lean that way and doesn't believe in it, I find it very irritating. One artist (her initials are PAC) was particularly irritating. Anyhow, it's a good book to keep you busy for a few weeks. If you don't mind the occasional &quot;I paint for God&quot; type of mentality, then it gets five stars.\n\nBook Lover.
