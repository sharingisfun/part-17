Musically, Country Love Songs supplies plenty of hardcore, bottle-tippin', honky tonk country, with a '50s production that sounds like it's supposed to be there. Fulks writes and sings country music that bears little or no resemblance to what dominates the airwaves; rather, his material harks back to an era when humor and dark subject matter shared the same page of a writer's composition book. Paying homage to the classic Bakersfield sound, with former Buckeroo Tom Brumley shining on pedal steel, Fulks delivers &quot;The Buck Starts Here,&quot; which just might be the best country song since &quot;He Stopped Loving Her Today.&quot; Lyrically, Fulks can travel some pretty spooky highways, as in the descriptive ballad &quot;Barely Human,&quot; a drinking song that's as tortured as they get, with the song's character &quot;barely human from twilight till dawn.&quot; Other strong tracks include the saga of an aging movie starlet who loses it in &quot;She Took a Lot of Pills (And Died)&quot; -- which first appeared on the second volume of the label's Insurgent Country compilations -- and the swingin' &quot;Every Kind of Music But Country.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c875dcc4a5438f7dc538bc3255c1cdfc28ebc8a2","amp;dn":"Robbie+Fulks+-+Country+Love+Songs+%5B1996%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c875dcc4a5438f7dc538bc3255c1cdfc28ebc8a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,117,220,196,165,67,143,125,197,56,188,50,85,193,205,252,40,235,200,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
