The programmes show what it is like to tackle the crimes that carry the toughest sentences, yet the lowest conviction rates.\n\n\n1)  Manhunt \nThis episode follows the first part of the high-profile historic abuse investigation into Ray Teret, a Manchester DJ and friend of Jimmy Savile, accused of a string of sex offences against schoolgirls in the 60s and 70s. Going behind the headlines, it shows what it takes to crack a case when the crimes were committed more than 30 years ago. This is no easy task when there is no crime scene, no CCTV and no DNA evidence to help the detectives.\n\n2)  Interrogation \nThis second episode in the series continues to follow the police investigation into Ray Teret, a Manchester DJ and friend of Jimmy Savile, accused of historic abuse against schoolgirls. It is centred on a dramatic three-day interrogation of Teret, at the end of which it is down to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide if he will be charged or walk free. It is the culmination of more than a year's work for detectives Rod and Carol - and the moment when they finally reveal to Teret how many victims they have found and how much evidence they have against him. Alongside the interrogation of Ray Teret, the film also follows an online-grooming investigation into Mark Cox, a 17-year-old accused of raping a 12-year-old girl.\n\n3)  Judgement Day \nThe last episode in the series features the final part of the investigation into Ray Teret, a Manchester DJ and friend of Jimmy Savile, charged with a string of historic sexual offences against 17 women. During Teret's eight-week trial, it follows detectives Rod and Carol through the last chapter of their investigation. After almost two years of painstaking work to build a case against Teret, it is now down to a jury to decide if he is guilty. The film also follows trainee detective Ruth as she investigates a report of the rape of a female student. Another detective, Mark, has been trying to crack a case for almost a year. It is an emotional day for him when he finally gets a breakthrough.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;85cdece2edc5c9b1abb4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3002 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/sVBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.26 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d126627ae893ea85062d60c20e2a947456fbdc","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Detectives.1of3.Manhunt.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d126627ae893ea85062d60c20e2a947456fbdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,209,38,98,122,232,147,234,133,6,45,96,194,14,42,148,116,86,251,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
