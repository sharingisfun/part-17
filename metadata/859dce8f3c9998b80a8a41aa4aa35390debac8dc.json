The founding of the Society is celebrated annually on World Vegan Day, which was established in 1994 by Louise Wallis the President and Chair.\nThe Society now defines veganism as &quot;...a way of living that seeks to exclude, as far as possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing and any other purpose.&quot;\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Historically, man has expanded the reach of his ethical calculations,\nas ignorance and want have receded, first beyond family and tribe,\nlater beyond religion, race, and nation. To bring other species\nmore fully into the range of these decisions may seem unthinkable\nto moderate opinion now.
