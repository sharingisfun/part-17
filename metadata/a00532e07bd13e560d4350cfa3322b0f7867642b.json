I am the last\nsupermarket trolley alive. Aloha.\n\nI once bet 500,000 pounds that God existed. I was a nut. Thanks\nto Edgar Malroy I am better now. Really\n\nI was made on the 3rd of November 2022, at 11.30 a.m., in an\nindustrial estate on the outskirts of Chelmsford.\n\nAfter I rolled off the production line I was greeted by a technician\nwith a friendly face. She tapped me on my push-bar and said the first\nwords I ever heard. Which were: Whos a pretty boy then?\nWhich was how I discovered my gender.\n\nFor a time I considered the technician with the friendly face a\nmother of sorts.\nWe all did I suppose.\n\nThe technician who said the first words I ever heard and tapped\nme on my push-bar was called Kitty Fitzgerald. She earned 9 pounds\n50 an hour in 2022. She was not incredibly enthusiastic about my\nexistence. She said Whos a pretty boy then? casually, as if\nshe was uninterested. In fact, she couldnt have cared less.\n\nThe reason why Kitty Fitzgerald couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have cared less about me\nor the other fifty trolleys she looked after was this: three weeks\nearlier she had come home to find her husband having sex with the\nfamily vacuum cleaner.\nThey got a divorce and she never spoke to the vacuum cleaner again.\n\n=======\n\nAlternative downloads :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayfiles.com/file/4t1t/MA6iu8/Scepticism_Inc_-_Bo_Fowler_-_1998.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayfiles.com/file/4t1t/MA6iu8/Scepticism_Inc_-_Bo_Fowler_-_1998.pdf&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nmagnet:?xt=urn:btih:A00532E07BD13E560D4350CFA3322B0F7867642B\n\n========\n\nEnjoy one of my all time favourite reads.\n\nShare it with everyone and don't forget to\nput your money where your metaphysics are on Bo's site.\n\nPeace.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a00532e07bd13e560d4350cfa3322b0f7867642b","amp;dn":"Scepticism+Inc+-+Bo+Fowler+-+1998+-+%5BPDF%5Dv2+-+GCJM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a00532e07bd13e560d4350cfa3322b0f7867642b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,5,50,224,123,209,62,86,13,67,80,207,163,50,43,15,120,103,100,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
