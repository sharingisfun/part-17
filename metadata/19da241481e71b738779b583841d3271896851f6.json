The reason for all of this, as she tells her new found friend, is that the next day she's going to a place &quot;where women are not women&quot;.\n\nThe following day, we find Maya in a convent, where she is stripped down in front of all the sisters as she makes her Holy vows to God and is then given her white veil. The story quickly begins to form as we find out that she's not there because of any desire to serve God, but rather to find out exactly what happened to her Mother, who died there 18 years prior. What happens thereafter are some of the most artfully directed scenes of lesbian love, whippings, fights and absurd blasphemy your ever likely to see, all ending with a sinfully sweet climax. It doesn't hurt that this is all enhanced by some absolutely beautiful music either. The entire production here is top-notch, and just simply couldn't be any better. Norifumi Suzuki should be very proud.\n\nHighly recommended to all fans of exploitation!\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nFile Name .......................................: School of the Holy Beast.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) .........................: 1.154.568.192 bytes\nRuntime ..........................................: 1:31:22\n\nvideo codec .....................................: XviD\nvideo bitrate .....................................: 1.482 Kbps\naudio codec .....................................: AC3\naudio bitrate .....................................: 192 kbps CBR 48 KHz\nResolution ........................................: 720 x 320\nAR .......................................................: 2.250\nFrame rate ........................................: 23.976 FPS\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0224077/\n\nnot my rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19da241481e71b738779b583841d3271896851f6","amp;dn":"Seij%C3%83%C2%BB+gakuen+a.k.a.+School+of+the+Holy+Beast+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19da241481e71b738779b583841d3271896851f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,218,36,20,129,231,27,115,135,121,181,131,132,29,50,113,137,104,81,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
