In its current state, it is basically vanilla Slacko 5.7 with Xfce4panel. No apps from the original have been removed (yet). Please test it out and provide feedback and bug reports. I would consider this beta quality, as there are some minor issues with the Xfce panel that I still need to work out, but it is still very usable. \n Thank You to 01micko and everyone else who had a hand in the creation of Slacko 5.7 \n\n The &quot;JX&quot; just stands for Jwm + Xfce4panel. This is a temporary name. I have a hard time trying to figure out names for my pups. Any suggestions for this one would be appreciated. \n\n EDIT: version 0.2 is now available, more info to come... \n\n Download Link: jxs_5.7v0.2.iso \n size:160MB \n md5sum: be18b49eed47fd48bc721cc5dc7b0f5c jxs_5.7v0.2.iso","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe32803d974c9ed782c8c4025912d7140a9bc07b","amp;dn":"Puppy_Linux_jx_slacko_archive_01-Apr-2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe32803d974c9ed782c8c4025912d7140a9bc07b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,50,128,61,151,76,158,215,130,200,196,2,89,18,215,20,10,155,192,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
