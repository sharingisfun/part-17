Of course, there is Mom and Dad who are always fighting, and those annoying neighbors who get to spend the summer at the beach. And then, there's Lea, the exasperating girl who's always right about everything. In the summer of '68, when Mom decides to leave everything behind to start a new life in Greece, Leon is prepared to do anything to kill the pain. Destroy the neighbors' house, become a professional liar and even, why not, fall in love with Lea. Together, they will overcome the pain of growing up when you feel abandoned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49db7608e763ca4300a2ff84b2e69f47304affa5","amp;dn":"Its.Not.Me.I.Swear.2008.DVDRip.XViD-TWiST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49db7608e763ca4300a2ff84b2e69f47304affa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,219,118,8,231,99,202,67,0,162,255,132,178,230,159,71,48,74,255,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
