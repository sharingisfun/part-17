Grossman can back up \n\neverything he says and believes musically, with an encyclopedic knowledge \n\nand feel for country-blues, rags, and fiddle tunes as demonstrated here. He \n\nruns through a gaggle of fine-sounding instruments, alternating between slide, \n\n12-string, and fingerpicked six-strings in a plethora of tunings, and never fails \n\nto deliver top-notch playing on every track. A must-have for folk-blues guitar \n\nenthusiasts. &quot;\n1991 Yazoo Basin Boogie     CD  Shanachie SHA-CD-97013 \n\n[img]http://i128.photobucket.com/albums/p180/SonAfterDark/tracklistlatest.p\n\nng[/img]\n\n1.
