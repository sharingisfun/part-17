When pressed for a quick and easy meal and no time to shop, I use this book and can always find a combination of soup, vegetable and meat that I have on hand and can make into something good to eat. It is a life saver over and over. I bought this as a gift for a friend who recently married and got several very picky-eater stepchildren as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpart of the packageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. She loves this book and the easy, quick recipes that at least most of the kids will eat. If you can find a copy, it is a wonderful book.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a802d53d416fe2c26c0467ed7e6cbcc8e58be36","amp;dn":"Campbell+Creative+Cooking+With+Soup+%3A+Over+19%2C000+Delicious+Mix+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a802d53d416fe2c26c0467ed7e6cbcc8e58be36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,128,45,83,212,22,254,44,38,192,70,126,215,230,203,204,142,88,190,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
