Then, the industry\nmoved up to flat panels &amp; high-bandwidth high-definition video feeds.\nAnd we all eagerly plugged our Over Canada DVDs into the upscaling\nDVD player, ready for something akin to BBC Earth. Wow. Were we\ndisappointed.\n  The DVD transfer of this video is a godless travesty of interlaced sadism.\nApparently, it was shot in high-definition, but whomever dumped it on\nto DVD must have had an undying penchant for 1930's broadcast quality.\n  I've been waiting for a high definition release of this flick, but I just\ndon't think it's coming. So, I dedicated a whack of computing cycles into\nthe SD feed, did a significant cleaning &amp; deinterlacing, and we can once\nagain watch it without getting a bleeding-eyed migraine..\n  I was unable to decimate the video down to a proper 23.976fps rate,\nhad to keep the NTSC 29.97fps, so any PAL people will likely have\nto watch it on a computer. But the frames are now progressive, and\nI used an excessive amount of bandwidth to maintain a nice clean\nimage.\n\n***********************************************************\n                          Over Canada\n***********************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4628e0181735e8cc9c20d64fe634ac9f120bdb3","amp;dn":"Over+Canada+%28cleaned+video%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4628e0181735e8cc9c20d64fe634ac9f120bdb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,98,142,1,129,115,94,140,201,194,13,100,254,99,74,201,241,32,189,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
