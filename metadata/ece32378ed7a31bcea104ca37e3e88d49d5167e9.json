Accounts of accidents that might not have been accidents after all, abound. Researchers and witnesses have vanished, never to be seen again. Conveniently timed hearth attacks are reported. Out-of-the-blue suicides that, upon investigation, bear the distinct hallmarks of murder, are all too common. And grisly deaths at the hands of both extraterrestrials and government agents have occurred. Highlights of close Encounters of the Fatal Kind include:\n\nThe strange saga of the incredible melting man.\nThe UFO-related death of the first U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal.\nThe mysterious disappearances of military pilots and their connection to UFOs.\nThe connections between national security and the sudden deaths of UFO investigators.\n\n\nBy Nick Redfern\nPublished by Career Press in 2014\nTags: nonfiction, mystery, ufology\nEPUB, Retail, 224 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece32378ed7a31bcea104ca37e3e88d49d5167e9","amp;dn":"Close+Encounters+of+the+Fatal+Kind+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece32378ed7a31bcea104ca37e3e88d49d5167e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,227,35,120,237,122,49,188,234,16,76,163,126,62,136,212,157,81,103,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
