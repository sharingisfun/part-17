(To mark the occasion, the first volume is at last reissued in a new presentation). As in the previous release in the series (with the mezzo-soprano Laura Polverelli), three concertos are here juxtaposed with three chamber cantatas, offering another chance to confirm the Prete rosso's inexhaustible inventiveness in these two genres, which gave him as much scope for instrumental and vocal virtuosity as his concertos with orchestra or his operas. In the concerto RV 100, we get a genuine dialogue between flute, violin, and bassoon, with the latter exploited for both its expressive range of colours and its great agility; in RV 92 and RV 108, it is the recorder's skill that is sorely tested. As to the cantatas, this time for soprano and continuo, they demand a soloist with faultless technique and a highly dramatic temperament: the almost hysterical outbursts, the acrobatic leaps, and the perilous series of top Cs in Geme l'onda are certainly not within the grasp of just any soprano! This is why L'AstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e have called on one of the most eminent Vivaldians of our day, the marvellous Gemma Bertagnolli, whose recent performances with Alessandrini and de Marchi have been universally acclaimed, and who achieves fresh triumphs here. \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n------------ Tracks -------------\n01-03.

The quicker movements all dance, where older and heavier bands were apt to make them slog, while in the dialogues between instruments the phrases really answer each other. In slow movements, on the other hand, the music is made to speak. Once again, it is notable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially in the Largo of RV87 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how much more romantic this music sounds played with freedom by a small original instruments group than it ever did with larger bands who were trying to put on baroque manners.\nIn the three cantatas, Laura Polverelli has a splendidly rich timbre, so much so that I almost took her for a contralto; but later Vivaldi sends her up to heights we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ask of contraltos and she ascends them with ease. Her lower notes are so splendidly rich that I wish there had been more of them....I rejoice in the sheer life of all these performances...the music is all magnificent, Vivaldi at his richest.\n\n\n-------------- Tracks ---------------\n01-03.
