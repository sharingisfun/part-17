And after everything theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen and learned in the past week, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re both more confused than ever about their future. Neither of them has mastered the magics theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need to protect themselves from the Dark Elders, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve lost Scatty, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still being pursued by Dr. John Dee. Most disturbing of all, however, is that now they must ask themselves, can they trust Nicholas Flamel? Can they trust anyone?\n\n\n\nThe Warlock\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dillonscott.com/wp-content/themes/wp-mpscott/images/the-secrets-of-the-immortal-nicholas-flamel-images/covers/the-warlock.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dillonscott.com/wp-content/themes/wp-mpscott/images/the-secrets-of-the-immortal-nicholas-flamel-images/covers/the-warlock.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn the fifth installment of this bestselling series, the twins of prophesy have been divided, and the end is finally beginning.\n\nWith Scatty, Joan of Arc, Saint Germain, Palamedes, and Shakespeare all in Danu Talis, Sophie is on her own with the ever-weakening Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel.

If they are not stopped, they will destroy everyone and everything in their path.\n\nBut even with the help of two of the greatest warriors from history and myth, will the Sorceress and the legendary Alchemyst be able to defend the city? Or is it the beginning of the end of the human race?\n\nDanu Talis:\nSophie and Josh Newman traveled ten thousand years into the past to Danu Talis when they followed Dr. John Dee and Virginia Dare.
