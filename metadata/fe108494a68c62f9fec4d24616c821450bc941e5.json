This makes it ideal for students from a wide range of academic backgrounds as the student can work through the material at their own pace. Mathematical theories are explained in a straightforward manner, being supported by practical engineering examples and applications in order to ensure that readers can relate theory to practice. The extensive and thorough topic coverage makes this an ideal text for introductory level engineering courses.\n\n\nThis title is supported by a companion website with resources for both students and lecturers, including lists of essential formulae, multiple choice tests, full solutions for all 1,600 further questions contained within the practice exercises, and biographical information on the 25 famous mathematicians and engineers referenced throughout the book.\n\nThe companion website for this title can be accessed from www.routledge.com/cw/bird","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe108494a68c62f9fec4d24616c821450bc941e5","amp;dn":"Basic+Engineering+Mathematics%2C+6E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe108494a68c62f9fec4d24616c821450bc941e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,16,132,148,166,140,98,249,254,196,210,70,22,200,33,69,11,201,65,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
