It is built around acoustic guitar work by Nuno Bettencourt and the vocals of Gary Cherone (with harmony vocals from Bettencourt). Released in 1990 on the album Extreme II: Pornograffiti, the song marked a departure from the funk metal that had permeated the band's style previous to its release.\n\nThe song was described by Bettencourt as a song warning that the phrase &quot;I love you&quot; was becoming meaningless: &quot;People use it so easily and so lightly that they think you can say that and fix everything, or you can say that and everything's OK. Sometimes you have to do more and you have to show it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there's other ways to say 'I love you.'&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b01328ed6357fdfd0a3e1fc33ab045b98783895b","amp;dn":"Extreme+-+More+Than+Words","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b01328ed6357fdfd0a3e1fc33ab045b98783895b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,19,40,237,99,87,253,253,10,62,31,195,58,176,69,185,135,131,137,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
