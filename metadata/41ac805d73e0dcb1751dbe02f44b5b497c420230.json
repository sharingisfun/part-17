Joy and George Adamson (portrayed by real-life married couple Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers) involuntarily domesticate several lions while living in Kenya. They keep one, named Elsa, until she is fully grown, and rather than turn her over to a zoo, they decide to train her to live like a wild animal so that they can release her into her natural habitat. Geoffrey Keen is a sympathetic government official who convinces the Adamsons that they should set Elsa free to avoid being ordered to place her in captivity. The film, based on Joy Adamson's book, is poignant and emotional without ever becoming banal or overly sentimental. The title song and film score both won Academy Awards.\n\nRip Specs\n\nFile Name .........................................: Born.Free.1966.DVDRip.XviD-VH-PROD.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 730,910,720 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 01:35:10\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD\nFrame Size ......................................: 560x240 (AR: 2.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 885 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.275 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055(MP3, ISO) MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 130 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060182&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060182&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Korean (vobsub)\n\nPosted originally at KG by caligula, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ac805d73e0dcb1751dbe02f44b5b497c420230","amp;dn":"James+Hill+-+Born+Free+%281966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ac805d73e0dcb1751dbe02f44b5b497c420230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,172,128,93,115,224,220,177,117,29,190,2,244,75,91,73,124,66,2,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
