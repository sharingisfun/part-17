Weiss \nExtremely Cool  \n\nLabel: Slow River\nReleased: February 1999\nSource: Original CD \nSize Torrent: 308 MB\nFormat: FLAC\n\n\n\n\nYou might think you're unfamiliar with Chuck E. Weiss, but you're probably incorrect. He became a permanent sidebar to pop culture when Rickie Lee Jones' ode to his romantic bliss &quot;Chuck E.'s In Love&quot; became a huge hit in the '70s. That decade saw the release of some Weiss solo material that went largely unnoticed. After a long recording layoff, veteran L.A. scenester Weiss returns with EXTREMELY COOL. Produced by his longtime buddy TOM WAITS, the album sounds like a slightly more accesible version of Waits' RAIN DOGS-era material, full of purposefully primitive percussion, artfully twisted, blindingly eclectic arrangements and gravelly, mad-dog vocals. Weiss' is a vision of America that effectively blends trailer park, carnival and freak show. His compositions are much more conventional than those of Waits (who cowrote a couple of tunes here), but the production takes them just as far from the mainstream as Waits' weirdest.\n\n\nPersonnel: \n\nChuck E.
