It includes fixes for many minor issues, improved USB support, and the replacement of Internet Explorer 4.0 with the significantly faster and lighter Internet Explorer 5.0. Also included is Internet Connection Sharing, which allows multiple computers on a LAN to share a single Internet connection through Network Address Translation. Other features in the update include Microsoft NetMeeting 3.0 and integrated support for DVD-ROM drives. A memory overflow issue was resolved which in the older version of Windows 98 would crash most systems if left running for 48 hours. Also included on the CD-ROM is the option to install Microsoft Plus! themes for Windows 98.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d4cac7896858bcbacb445b7b7110605e6aa23e1","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Windows+98+Second+Edition+%28SE%29%2BCD-KEY-Valor-Team","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d4cac7896858bcbacb445b7b7110605e6aa23e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,76,172,120,150,133,139,203,172,180,69,183,183,17,6,5,230,170,35,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
