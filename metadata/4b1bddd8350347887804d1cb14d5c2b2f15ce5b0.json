Prince stars in this movie, which was\ndeveloped to showcase his particular talents. The film was very\nsuccessful earning nearly US$70 million at the box office.\n\n\nProduction\n\nThe movie idea was apparently developed by Prince during his &quot;Triple\nThreat&quot; tour. Initially the script was to be darker and more coherent.\nPrince intended to cast his girlfriend Vanity, but their relationship ended.\nHer role was initially offered to Jennifer Beals (who turned it down\nbecause she wanted to concentrate on college) before going to Apollonia\nKotero, a virtual unknown at the time. Excluding Prince and his onscreen\nparents, almost every actor in the movie uses his/her actual\nname for his/her character.\n\n\nPlot\n\nPrince plays &quot;The Kid&quot;, an aspiring and talented, but troubled young\nMinneapolis musician with a difficult home life. He meets a singer named\nApollonia, and they become involved in an untidy romance. The plot\ncenters on Prince trying not to repeat the pattern of his abusive alcoholic\nfather (Clarence Williams III) and keep his band, The Revolution, and his\nrelationship with his girlfriend, together. His main antagonist is fellow\nmusician Morris Day and his group The Time.\n\n\n\nDirected by Albert Magnoli\nProduced by Robert Calvallo,\nSteven Fargnoli,\nJoseph Ruffalo\nWritten by Albert Magnoli,\nWilliam Blinn\nStarring Prince,\nMorris Day,\nApollonia Kotero\nClarence Williams III\nMusic by Prince,\nMichel Colombier,\nJohn L.
