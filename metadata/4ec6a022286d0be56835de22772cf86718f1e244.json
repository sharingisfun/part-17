It gives you the power to mask or cut out areas of your video, so that you can mix and merge it with other clips, animations or even just with black. Mattes are used everywhere, including music videos, show opens &amp; high end commercials. They are simple to use and best of all, they keep your footage as the star. However, making a great matte, particularly a great animated matte, can be difficult and time-consuming.
