Folks like Pete Seeger, Jean Ritchie, and Jean Redpath were the headliners ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Dylan kid was one of the second-tier acts, with a chance to play two short solo sets.\n\nAt that point, DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album had been out a little over a year and hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t done a whole lot commercially. His sophomore effort ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The FreewheelinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bob Dylan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was still a couple of weeks away from being released when Dylan took the stage with his guitar, harmonicas, and neck rack. He didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have a name or a reputation to coast on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ he was just another folk singer trying to make it. Dylan had to stand flat-footed and either win or lose the crowd on the merits of his performances that night.\n\nIn a move that would horrify most PR people nowadays, the songs Dylan doled out during his two sets had nothing to do with the album that was in the stores. Nor did he play many of the potential ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhitsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the record about to be released. Anthems-to-be such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Hard RainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A-Gonna FallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Think TwiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlowinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ In The WindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were held back in favor of a mix of humor-laced talking blues and some mood-driven pieces. (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMasters of WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the only song on this recording that would remain a staple in the Dylan catalog in the decades to come.) You could say that young Bob Dylan was about as commercially driven then as he is now ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ maybe even less so. The songs he played at Brandeis were songs he wanted to play; wanted to lay on the audience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not songs that would help promote his records.\n\nAnd he played them well.\n\nLuckily for us, someone was rolling tape that evening and captured Bob Dylan in action.\n\nIn Concert ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brandeis University 1963 includes seven songs taken from the eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two sets. We join the album-opening ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoney, Just Allow Me One More ChanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ already in progress as it lopes and chugs along; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTalkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ closes things down with a blast of the young BobÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dry wit, clever social commentary, dead-on timing and delivery. By the time he gets to the end of his tale of an innocent outing that went badly awry, the crowd is eating up every word; listening for the next one-liner tossed off between verses and roaring with laughter. In short, Dylan had them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they were totally his by the time he left the stage.\n\nThe hardest-hitting song of the eveningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performances was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBallad of Hollis BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, documenting the despair and eventual mental breakdown of an impoverished South Dakota farmer. The guitar work is simple; the delivery is ominous and direct. DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics make their case ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and in the end, there seems to be no other way out than to reach for the shotgun:\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seven people dead on a South Dakota farm,\nSomewhere in the distance thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seven new people born\n\n33 years later, Wilco would chronicle a characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gradual mental breakdown in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMisunderstoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, letting the tension build throughout the song as waves of chaotic sound are used to good effect. In this performance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHollis BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Dylan accomplishes the same with nothing but the starkness of his voice and guitar.\n\nAh, that Dylan kid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ he was good, wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t he? In Concert ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brandeis University 1963 is evidence of such.\n\n1\tHoney, Just Allow Me One More Chance [incomplete]\t1:58\t \n2\tTalkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\t4:40\t \n3\tBallad Of Hollis Brown\t7:10\t \n4\tMasters Of War\t6:28\t \n5\tTalkin' World War III Blues\t6:24\t \n6\tBob Dylan's Dream\t5:57\t \n7\tTalking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\t5:45\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda37b7d87a23ffb5053cf3e5bcc50ee27282f14","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+LIVE+Brandeis+University+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda37b7d87a23ffb5053cf3e5bcc50ee27282f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,163,123,125,135,162,63,251,80,83,207,62,91,204,80,238,39,40,47,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
