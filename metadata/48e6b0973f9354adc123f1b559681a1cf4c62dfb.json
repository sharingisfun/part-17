Circles in the Stream\nThree very different young teens, Emily, the shy one, Adriane, the outsider, and Kara, the power shopper, are all drawn to a secret place deep in the woods where they discover a portal to another world. Wondrous animals have emerged from the portal, desperately seeking the magic that will keep them alive. Though the animals are peaceful and good, what follows them through the portal is twisted and evil and bent on destroying them all.\n\n2. All That Glitters\nEmily and Adriane have one thing Kara doesn't--a magic gem. When Kara finally finds a stone of her own, a diamond unicorn horn, no less, it brings more trouble than anyone can handle. For Kara's jewel is the most powerful of all. But with great power comes great danger. If Kara messes up using her magic, there may be no escape for anyone.\n\n3. Cry of the Wolf\nAdriane and Stormbringer the Mistwolf have a unique bond. When Stormbringer is lured into the portal to Aldenmor, Adriane pursues her companion into the magical world, where she must confront the entire mistwolf pack in order to bring Storm home. The strange boy she meets in that land of wonders and terrors may help her, but Adriane will need Emily and KaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s magic as backup if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to survive this battle.\n\n4. The Secret of the Unicorn\nSomething has happened to the heart of Aldenmor. The Fairy Glen has vanished! New animal refugees are arriving in Ravenswood, including a mysterious and wild unicorn.

But Conrad may be hiding a dangerous secret that threatens the animals, Ravenswood, and the girls themselves.\n\n6. Trial by Fire\nFairmentals, made of Earth, Water and Air have tried to help Emily, Karan and Adriane find Avalon.
