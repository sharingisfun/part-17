Yesterday we released the rare footage of          \n         Jim's NYC memorial service, and we just don't have          \n         the heart to wrap this up on a sad note. Instead,           \n         we give you a bonus day and a bonus title with The          \n         Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson.                               \n                                                                     \n           During the 6 months that had passed since Jim             \n         tragically died, there had been a lot of speculation        \n         about what was going to happen to The Muppets, to           \n         the company (the deal with Disney had fallen through        \n         since his death), to the many universes that Jim            \n         had created. This special served both to show the           \n         fans that his legacy would go on, but importantly,          \n         to honor Jim, his life, and his amazing career of           \n         35 years. It's in many ways a sad tribute, but at           \n         the same time a very sweet and heart-warming                \n         retrospective of his life, all the while remaining          \n         true to the Muppet spirit, and staying silly. A             \n         lot of characters had to be recast in a way that            \n         had never happened before, but sadly would happen           \n         again just 2 years later when Richard Hunt died.            \n         Steve Whitmire, who would take over iconic Kermit           \n         (and who shares his birthday with Jim), has later           \n         recounted just how nervous he was trying to fill            \n         the biggest shoes in Muppet history. As a Family            \n         Guy reference many years later would allude to;             \n         &quot;..now we have funny sounding Muppets&quot;, yet everyone        \n         pitched in to show that the death of Jim would not          \n         spell the end of The Muppets.                               \n                                                                     \n           The special ends with a truly massive all hands           \n         on deck scene, featuring an impressive number of            \n         Muppets, Fraggles and Sesame Street characters all          \n         singing Just One Person together.                           \n                                                                     \n           To also wrap up the many extras we have included          \n         during this calendar, we've thrown in one last one          \n         for you. Jerry Juhl, the longest serving writer for         \n         Henson, the second employee of the company (not             \n         counting Jim's wife Jane), and perhaps the single           \n         most important person in shaping the character of           \n         The Muppets outside of Jim, died on September 26,           \n         2005 from a brief battle with cancer. In A Special          \n         Tribute to Jerry Juhl, his co-workers and friends           \n         are interviewed about his neverending creativity            \n         through the decades, as well as his generosity              \n         in writing and being. It also includes a clip of            \n         the Muppet performance at his memorial service.             \n                                                                     \n           We hope you've enjoyed this calendar, and keep            \n         in mind that while most of the titles we have               \n         presented are things that are either out of print,          \n         have never been released on DVD or have never been          \n         released on home video at all, there's still a              \n         plethora of Henson material available for purchase.         \n         While we await digital releases, why not check out          \n         some of the many other Henson titles out there -            \n         you might help fund the upcoming Fraggle feature            \n         film!                                                       \n                  Enjoy!                                             \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                                                                     \n                              ~HO HO HO~                             \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                 For the month of December we've decided to     \n                do something special.
