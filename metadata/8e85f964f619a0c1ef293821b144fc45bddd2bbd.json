Amin Bhatia's acclaimed recording &quot;The Interstellar \nSuite&quot; has been digitally remastered from its original analog elements \nand is currently at the pressing plant. You will be able to order your \nCD through an exclusive web retailer to be identified on launch day, \nTuesday November the 4th. Please visit www.interstellarsuite.com to \nget the official launch schedule for your universe. Yes, finally. No, we \ncan't believe it either. Thank you so much for your patience and \nencouragement. This &quot;interstellar&quot; battle has taken years and would \nnot have been possible without you. As further thanks, the first 500 \npeople who quote the phrase &quot;Distress Signal&quot; upon ordering, will \nreceive 1 of only 500 CDs personally signed and numbered by the \ncomposer, Amin Bhatia. Best wishes, The crew at www.\ninterstellarsuite.com \n\nYears ago, as electronic music was strengthening its position in the \nmainstream and the radio was starting to play what became known as \n&quot;New Age Music&quot;, there emerged a new label called Cinema, which \nwas a new imprint from Capitol Records. The Cinema artists were \nmostly renowned keyboard artists from well-known bands, such as \nPeter Bardens (Camel), Patrick Moraz, Tony Kaye (both from Yes) \nand Michael Hoenig. And then there was Amin Bhatia, whose release \nhas far outlived the others, and, in fact, most titles from that era, \ncirca 1987. \n\nUnfortunately, the label folded soon after its launch, and these CDs \nhave been unavailable since. Due to a total committemnt to quality \nand enduring music, Amin has never let up in his desire to make this \nCD available again. It just took a while!! Now, BACKROADS Music is \npleased to be the Source for this classic CD that was so far ahead of \nits time that even now it is groundbreaking, and it sounds more \nsensational than ever thanks to the process in which the CD has been \ndigitally remastered from its original analog elements... \n\n&quot;...Bhatia has composed a whole orchestral suite as a soundtrack for \nan imaginary wide-screen science fiction movie and then produced it \non synthesizers. The debt to composers like John Williams is evident, \nbut Bhatia manages to avoid bombast and electronic clich?, leaning \ninstead on string timbres and Minimoog brass. Fragments of imaginary \ndialog also pop up here and there, adding to the sense of drama. \nDefinitely a winner.&quot; -JA, Keyboard Magazine Mar 1988.\n\n&quot;...Amin Bhatia's The Interstellar Suite is on a new Capital subsidiary \ncalled Cinema.. Though this full synthesized suite is not from any \nsoundtrack, some enterprising movie-maker could almost make a sci-fi \npicture based on its music. Guideposts are offered via track titles such \nas &quot;The Ship&quot;, &quot;Launch&quot;, &quot;Distress Signal&quot;, &quot;Rescue Fleet&quot;, &amp; &quot;Battle&quot;. \nThis is superb, imaginative and inventive music.&quot; -Jan 89 &quot;...I'd give \nthis all-instrumental album an 88/100 &amp; I'd change that to about a 94\n/100, if I were a fan of Star Trek music. Alas, the main setback of \nthis album is that it is SO hard to come by.&quot; -David Barrio, Gibraltar \nEncyclopedia of Progressive Rock Feb 97.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.17 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e85f964f619a0c1ef293821b144fc45bddd2bbd","amp;dn":"Amin+Bhatia+-+The+Interstellar+Suite+%5BNew+Age+Neo-Classical+Spac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e85f964f619a0c1ef293821b144fc45bddd2bbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,133,249,100,246,25,160,193,239,41,56,33,177,68,252,69,189,221,43,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
