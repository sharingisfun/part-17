Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 ducats to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor â€“ his ships and merchandise are busy at sea â€“ he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.\r\n\r\nMy notes\r\n\r\n  Included here are the dvd features provided with the disk for this production.  Casting is a particular point of interest.  Makram Khoury is interviewed and is a Palestinian from Isreal.  The set for the RSC is also  profiled in a separate featurette.\r\n\r\n  In the my collection at TPB  is another Merchant of Venice.  That one is set in Pre-War Nazi Germany directed by Trevor Nunn.  Both productions have  highlights that make them exceptional.  Watch for the cabaret song in the Trevor Nunn production.  \r\n\r\n  As always, these encodes are just a way for those interested to get them for their libraries that others may enjoy them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:673f66069b9b9e2ea34ff8cfdb56f9c77600d52c","amp;dn":"RSC+The+Merchant+of+Venice+%282016%29+Live+From+Stratford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"673f66069b9b9e2ea34ff8cfdb56f9c77600d52c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,63,102,6,155,155,158,46,163,79,248,207,219,86,249,199,118,0,213,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
