It was voted 1992 Album of the Year by the NME. All of the songs were written by guitarist/vocalist Bob Mould, who also co-produced with Lou Giordano. The song Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe SlimÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is about losing someone to AIDS. Musically, the band continues the thick punk guitar of Mould's previous band, HÃƒÂ¼sker DÃƒÂ¼, while slowing the tempo and emphasizing melody even more. Several tracks were recorded for this album, but were not included. Mould decided to release them separately as an EP entitled Beaster.\n\nIn July 24, 2012, the album was reissued by Merge Records as a 3-disc set containing the full album accompanied by B-sides (disc 1), the Beaster EP (disc 2), and a 1992 live performance at the Cabaret Metro (disc 3).
