So far, 10 have been released, and this torrent collects all of them in one package for convenience. The current roster is Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Thor, Wolverine, The Avengers, The X-Men, Hulk, Dr. Strange, Daredevil, The Fantastic Four, and Iron Man. This is a great place to start if you are new to any particular hero or group and want to catch up from the beginning - without the heavy exposition style of the 60's. In addition, even if you are already a fan, it's cool to see a different spin on things as well as lots of foreshadowing and easter eggs that abound for those familiar with the lore. All of these are in digital format, and all credit to the scanners who are listed along with the books. Enjoy, and please seed, thanks! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f593fdaea08981adeb4d3c99b95a22652d87b62b","amp;dn":"Marvel+Season+One+%282012-2013%2C+Digital%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f593fdaea08981adeb4d3c99b95a22652d87b62b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,147,253,174,160,137,129,173,235,77,60,153,185,90,34,101,45,135,182,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
