Track information and cover art may not be available for all of them.\n\nTo prevent the problems with tag corruption that plagued my last attempt to share this fine old music with you, I have wrapped each torrent into a single .rar file. I will be seeding five of them, so be sure to amaze your friends and collect them all.  :D\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\nChants de l&amp;#039;-lise de Rome (Ensemble Organum)\nMarcel Peres (Ensemble Organum)\nGregorian Chants, Christmas Chants (various)\nRussian Medieval Chant- The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (The Russian Patriarchate Choir)\n\nAll are high quality rips at 320 kB or better! Enjoy -- and keep seeding!\n\n-- Rivenshield","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cffa44ae16ebb6178c30e381f1078e89162d46d8","amp;dn":"Chants+of+the+Middle+Ages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cffa44ae16ebb6178c30e381f1078e89162d46d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,250,68,174,22,235,182,23,140,48,227,129,241,7,142,137,22,45,70,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
