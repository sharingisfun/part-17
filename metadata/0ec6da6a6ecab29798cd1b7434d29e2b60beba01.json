But its journey to our glasses is more complicated than we realise. With a booming worldwide population, where will our water come from in the future? And is it safe to drink tap water? Is bottled water wasteful? Drinking Water explains the overlooked and surprising history of drinking water from Biblical conflicts to overpriced mineral water. You will never look at your glass in the same way again.\nGenre: Non Fiction , History ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec6da6a6ecab29798cd1b7434d29e2b60beba01","amp;dn":"Drinking+Water+A+History+By+James+Salzman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ec6da6a6ecab29798cd1b7434d29e2b60beba01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,198,218,106,110,202,178,151,152,205,27,116,52,210,158,43,96,190,186,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
