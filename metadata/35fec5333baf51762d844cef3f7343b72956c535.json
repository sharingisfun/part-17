I'll post links to the others in the comments.\n\nDescription of entire set (all 7 torrents):\n-----------------------\nEvery song for every USA Billboard year-end top singles chart from 1946-2012.\n\n6,102 total songs.\n\n1946: Top 48\n1947: Top 47\n1948: Top 39\n1949-1955: Top 30\n1956-2012: Top 100 (more than 100 for some years due to multi-song singles)\n\nEvery file is consistently tagged and has ReplayGain information set.  All tag information comes from the chart data at http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/ and should match exactly.\n\nEverything is in MP3 format, and the vast majority of the songs are good quality, although about 200 or so songs from the late 1950s are at 96kbps.  Originally, most of these came out of other torrents on Demonoid, so it's what there was to work with.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35fec5333baf51762d844cef3f7343b72956c535","amp;dn":"Billboard+Year-End+Charts+1946-1959","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35fec5333baf51762d844cef3f7343b72956c535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,254,197,51,59,175,81,118,45,132,76,239,63,115,67,183,41,86,197,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
