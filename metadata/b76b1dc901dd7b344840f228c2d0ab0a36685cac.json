As well as advising about the timing of jobs in the garden throughout the year and in all Australian climate zones, it gives suggestions about garden-related events and celebrations for each month. Mary Horsfall wants people to realize that gardens are for much more than working in and the book begins with a discussion about the importance of gardens and plants in our lives, public gardens as well as private ones.\nMonthly chapters have been structured to make as much information as possible generally relevant to gardeners across the country. Each month includes topics such as planning, bushfire preparation, watering, pot plant care, mulching, weeding, fertilizing, pruning, propagating, pest control and what to plant for different climate zones.\nEach month, Mary details my own gardening year, including jobs done, fruits and veggies harvested, food cooked based on the harvest, what was in flower and wildlife observations. Each month has a special topic of the month, which is examined in detail. Some of these include fun for kids in the garden, biodiversity, manipulating microclimate, and fragrance and first aid.\n\nAbout the Author\nMary Horsfall has over 30 years experience in organic gardening, including 23 years growing self-sufficiency food crops organically in a dry-summer environment with only dam and tank water. Mary is an editor and writer for Grass Roots magazine, where she has worked for 18 years. Mary also wrote Creating Your Eco-friendly Garden and Fabulous Food from Every Small Garden.\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgements\nIntroduction\nThe garden cornucopia\nJanuary - Topic of the month: garden fun for kids\nFebruary - Topic of the month: shady days\nMarch - Topic of the month: manipulating microclimate\nApril - Topic of the month: legumes and other friends of the soil\nMay - Topic of the month: bulbs and friends\nJune - Topic of the month: pruning pointers\nJuly - Topic of the month: bare-rooted planting\nAugust - Topic of the month: propagation projects\nSeptember - Topic of the month: biodiversity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what is it all about?\nOctober - Topic of the month: pollinate or perish\nNovember - Topic of the month: fragrance and first aid\nDecember - Topic of the month: easy ways for summer days\nAppendix 1: Bibliography\nAppendix 2: Home-made pest control\nAppendix 3: Suppliers\nAppendix 4: Soil temperatures for vegetable germination\nAppendix 5: Garlic and onion planting times\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76b1dc901dd7b344840f228c2d0ab0a36685cac","amp;dn":"Gardens+for+All+Seasons+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b76b1dc901dd7b344840f228c2d0ab0a36685cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,107,29,201,1,221,123,52,72,64,242,40,194,208,171,10,54,104,92,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
