It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 400 years. The King James Version present on the Bible Gateway matches the 1987 printing. The KJV is public domain in the United States.\t\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://gospelgo.com/q/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://gospelgo.com/q/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda2cb90f8321478239d139ca874a4568d8361ef","amp;dn":"King+James+Bible+KJV+-+Cambridge+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda2cb90f8321478239d139ca874a4568d8361ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,162,203,144,248,50,20,120,35,157,19,156,168,116,164,86,141,131,97,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
