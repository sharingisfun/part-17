It focuses on four Chinese American immigrant families in San Francisco, California who start a club known as &quot;the Joy Luck Club,&quot; playing the Chinese game of mahjong for money while feasting on a variety of foods. The book is structured somewhat like a mahjong game, with four parts divided into four sections to create sixteen chapters. The three mothers and four daughters (one mother, Suyuan Woo, dies before the novel opens) share stories about their lives in the form of vignettes. Each part is preceded by a parable relating to the game.\n\n8 Audio CDs\nMP3 - 96kbps, Mono\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_Luck_Club&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_Luck_Club&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51e067bd4a87081d29a67d14c74edbe8cd938fcf","amp;dn":"The+Joy+Luck+Club+Amy+Tan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51e067bd4a87081d29a67d14c74edbe8cd938fcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,224,103,189,74,135,8,29,41,166,125,20,199,78,219,232,205,147,143,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
