In Weyworld you will find new secrets to uncover, rival tribes to meet and a host of new god-like abilities to unlock.\n\nAdditionally, we have redesigned the Voyages mini-game to give you new ways to play and win unique rewards to decorate your world.\n\nThe lost Ark\nYour people long to move to a new land and to do this, you must help them build an Ark for their journey across uncharted waters. This Ark will take all the Followers who worked on it to a new land called Weyworld, along with huge amount of resources Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 500 Ore and 700 Wheat, to be precise.\n\nBuilding this Ark is no easy feat and will take a considerable amount of time and resources to complete. Once ready, it will carry up to 500 of your Followers on the voyage to Weyworld. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry, even though this is a one-way migration for your seafaring Followers, as their almighty god you will be able to return to Homeworld whenever you choose via the Lighthouse.\n\nWeyworld is waiting\nOnce the Ark arrives at Weyworld, your first task will be to house all the Followers aboard in new abodes unique to this land.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll quickly notice that Weyworld has its own distinctive visual style Ã¢â‚¬â€œ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a desert world where the trees and rocks youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with in Homeworld are replaced by cacti and baked earth. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the only difference, however Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in Weyworld, crops need to be built on verdant land and mines on rugged land if your want them to flourish and your Followers to prosper.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also find a third type of terrain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hallowed ground. Here you will be able to build monasteries of various sizes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while these produce no workers, they do generate an awful lot of belief!\n\nYour wayfaring Followers arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the first to call Weyworld home Ã¢â‚¬â€œ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover three tribes of mischievous Astari up to their usual tricks. The Astari have hidden an enormous treasure in Weyworld and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to claim it for your Followers.\n\nEnter the Frontier Age\nWeyworld ushers in the Frontier Age, bringing with it a new Timeline and new cards for you to unlock with new stickers. All the cards you would have unlocked in Homeworld will be active in Weyworld - any cards not unlocked can be completed by returning to Homeworld.\n\nSome of the new abilities youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll earn will enhance your FollowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives and others will increase your own godly powers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a few that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover in the new world:\n\n    Blue skies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by your will the skies shall remain bright and clear. Storms will occur less frequently.\n    Stormy weather Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keep the skies angry by your wrath! Storms will appear more frequently.\n    Comet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ blast apart layers of granite with these celestial projectiles.\n    Enhanced meteors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing like a good meteor strike to vent your divine wrathÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re even more powerful!\n    Epic sculpting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unlock the ability to sculpt even more layers of terrain at once.\n    Dig Down Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unlock the ability to dig directly downwards by double-tapping/clicking.\n    Fleet of Foot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a healthy diet and plenty of exercise lead to fitter and faster Followers.\n    Crop rotation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ your Farmers develop wonderful new agricultural techniques and fields now produce much more Wheat.\n\n\nMore Voyages, redesigned Voyages\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve refined the gameplay for Voyages in this update Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you no longer have to complete a Voyage within a limited amount of time. However, the more quickly you complete a Voyage, the more points youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll earn. What do points mean? Points mean prizes! The higher your score in a Voyage, the more stars youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll complete for it, with a total of three stars available for each Voyage.\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also added a new series of Voyages with this update, called Spooky Shores Ã¢â‚¬â€œ earning a high score in these Voyages will unlock a slew of suitably-spooky Halloween themed content, such as creepy masks for your Followers or eerie graves for your Settlements.\n\nFuture updates\nWe still have plenty left in store to bring to Weyworld and the Frontier Age.\n\nFuture updates will add an area thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home to a new rival tribe along with sheep that roam the land, as well as for the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dynamic water to turn previously barren lands into fertile plains.\n\nComing soon to PC &amp; Mac - Balance File Editor &amp; Steamworks integration\nWe have some very good news for everyone playing Godus on Steam for Mac and Windows PC Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the hotly anticipated Balance File Editor we first detailed in this blog[www.22cans.com] is confirmed to be released on Friday 31st October.\n\nThis tool will allow you modify how many aspects of the game behave, from wait timers to Belief generation and more besides. Thanks to Steamworks integration, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also be able to share and swap your personalised balance files with each other also with us here at 22cans. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be looking at the best and most popular balance changes you develop with a view to implementing them based on your feedback ahead of when Godus transitions out of Early Access and into full release.\n\nSet sail for new discoveries!\nYou can download the Frontier Age update for Godus on the main branch of Steam right now just by launching the game. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking forward to hearing what you make of all this new content on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and our forums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ see you around!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70f315213e06d81f448c1cf4ecc437092e1a75f0","amp;dn":"Godus+Beta+v2.3+Cracked-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70f315213e06d81f448c1cf4ecc437092e1a75f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,243,21,33,62,6,216,31,68,140,28,244,236,196,55,9,46,26,117,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
