Burn it or mount with Alcohol 120%, Daemon Tools etc.\n\n\n\nWorking serials and keygen are included.\n\n\n\nThere are some bugs.\n\n1) Sometimes Document Express Enterprise unexpectedly exits just after loading with error info about &quot;some missing/incorrect directory {0}&quot;. The reason is unknown (?), but this program is easily recovered by reinstalling it (you can just choose &quot;Repair/Upgrade&quot; option of installer).\n\n2) Some PDFs can't be converted to DjVu, probably because of pdftodjvu using outdated GhostScript engine version 8.14. Unfortunately, it cannot be upgraded to the recent versions without breaking the functionality of pdftodjvu.\n\n3) Sometimes IRIS OCR engine doesn't like some pages, so it doesn't produce text layer there. Fortunately, alternative OCR software (such as FineReader) can be used later to do OCR in DjVu documents.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nSome components are distributed free of charge, so updated versions of them can be downloaded from:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.caminova.jp/en/downloads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.caminova.jp/en/downloads/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(Choose DjVu Browser Plug-in and DjVu Shell Extension Pack).\n\n\n\nThe ownership rights to the commercial development of the DjVu encoding software have been transferred to different companies over the years, including AT&amp;T, LizardTech, Celartem and Caminova, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nThere is some nice free open source DjVu software.\n\n1) WinDjView is a nice free DjVu viewer for MS Windows: http://windjview.sourceforge.net\n\n2) DjVuLibre is Open Source DjVu library and viewer for Linux, MacOS and other platforms: http://djvu.sourceforge.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888df9cde7da81b6ab1da59f8340ff7707d7d34f","amp;dn":"LizardTech+Document+Express+Ent+5.1+%26+Pro+6.0+%28DjVu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888df9cde7da81b6ab1da59f8340ff7707d7d34f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,141,249,205,231,218,129,182,171,29,165,159,131,64,255,119,7,215,211,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
