Our founding fathers understood that without faith in God, rights and morality could not last. Without religion, true freedom cannot long endure. So for those who seek to take those rights away, transferring the gifts given by God to the individual back to the control of a secularist state, belief in God is the first tie to be severed.\n\nSince the 1920s, a battle has waged across America between radical leftists of the ACLU and those who would keep America true to its inception as Ã¢â‚¬Å“one nation, under God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bad Samaritans is best-selling author Jerome CorsiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s explosive look into the history of ACLU and its radical agenda to separate America from its religious roots and remake our nation in its own atheistic image.\n\nTold in a straightforward, no-nonsense style, Corsi lays out the history of this struggle, its communist roots, and the court cases that are serving to slowly erode the foundations of our freedom. Today we see the fruits of the ACLUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s master planÃ¢â‚¬â€a culture flooded with pornography, placing little worth on the value of a human life, and one in which protection and special treatment seem to exist for everyone except those of a Judeo-Christian background.\n\nBad Samaritans looks behind the headlines and shows the ACLUÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fingerprints as it works to destroy freedom and enslave our constitutional republic to the demands of a Marxist state. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to fight back.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. Jerome R. Corsi received a Ph.D. from Harvard University in political science in 1972.
