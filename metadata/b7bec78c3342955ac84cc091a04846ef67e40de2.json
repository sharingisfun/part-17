The town is full of tourists and the at the Perpignan police headquarters, Sebag and Molino, two tired cops who are being slowly devoured by dull routine and family worries, deal with the dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s misdemeanors and petty complaints without a trace of enthusiasm.\n\nBut out of the blue a young Dutch woman is brutally murdered on a beach at ArgelÃƒÂ¨s, and another disappears without a trace in the alleys of the city. A serial killer obsessed with Dutch women? Maybe. The media goes wild.\n\nGilles Sebag finds himself thrust into the middle of a diabolical game. If he intends to salvage anything. He will have to put aside his domestic cares, forget his suspicions about his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faithfulness, ignore his heart murmur, and get over his existential angst. He waits joylessly, patiently, and lets himself go. The stone house may end up being his grave. WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing what, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chasing who?\n\nGenre: Fiction, Literary, Mystery/Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7bec78c3342955ac84cc091a04846ef67e40de2","amp;dn":"Summertime%2C+All+Cats+Are+Bored+by+Philippe+Georget","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7bec78c3342955ac84cc091a04846ef67e40de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,190,199,140,51,66,149,90,200,76,192,145,160,72,70,239,103,228,13,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
