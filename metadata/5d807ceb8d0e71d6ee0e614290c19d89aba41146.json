With a string of classic albums and a heavy world-touring schedule, the band was a driving force of the thrash metal movement of the `80s and early `90s. But when many of their peers began chasing empty trends and losing their edge, OVERKILL never wavered and are one of the last soldiers standing that can still properly deliver a good metal ass kicking - a fact confirmed by a single viewing of this DVD.\n\nIn March of 2002 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, OVERKILL gave back to the community that launched them with a blistering performance now captured forever in the form of WRECKING EVERYTHING - LIVE. With a set list spanning their entire influential career (including some rarely performed classics), the album is the definitive snapshot of a hometown OVERKILL show. The enthusiasm is boundless, the energy is through the roof and, well, you can almost smell the Jersey air. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Necroshine\n02. Thunderhead\n03. E.Vil N.Ever D.Ies\n04.
