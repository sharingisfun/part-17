The scripting language is simple yet powerful, and complex filters can be created from basic operations to develop a sophisticated palette of useful and unique effects.\n\nplz seed after downloading..\n\ndont give any unwanted comments...like some shits who are already wasting my time..\n\nthanks you..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c988a6fe12ed4d77d93e8c84408ef7c56787422","amp;dn":"Avisynth+258+%5BVERIFIED%5D+By+Team+Nanban","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c988a6fe12ed4d77d93e8c84408ef7c56787422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,152,138,111,225,46,212,215,125,147,232,200,68,8,239,124,86,120,116,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
