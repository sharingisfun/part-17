ENJoY!\n\n \n\nTibetan Buddhist rites from the monasteries of Bhutan CD1\n\n\nThe first day of March marked a new era in Bhutanese history when \na nationwide ban on smoking in public places was enacted. The \ncurrent law, along with a prohibition on the sale of all tobacco \nproducts (enacted two months earlier), was justified by the \ncountryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s health ministry as a way of protecting both past and \nfuture generations. Continued preservation of a distinct Bhutanese \nway of life has been a mainstay of the current government, as found \nin stringent tourist laws, mandates on the protection of forests \nand in promotion of the idea of Gross Domestic Happiness. \n\n\n\n\nThirty years earlier, King Jigme Darje Wangchuck, imbued with a \nsimilar spirit of conservation, invited ethnomusicologist and \nEnglishman John Levy to record and document the music of Bhutan. \nWhile Levy died in 1976 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ he was 66 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ he left behind over 700 \nrecordings, including songs from his native England, Iceland, \nSri Lanka, Taiwan, South Korea, China and Bhutan. A recent reissue \nof LevyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Bhutanese taped recordings, from 1971, have been \nre-mastered and reissued as a two CD set entitled, Tibetan Buddhist \nRites from the Monasteries of Bhutan. \n\n\nFour schools of thought dominate the religious landscape of Tibetan \nBuddhism; they are the Gelukpa, Nyingmapa, Kagyu and Sakhya orders. \nEach of the schools interact with one another and share similarities, \nbut they also differ in aspects of practice, certain teachings \n(e.g. philosophical, epistemological), and musical traditions. \n\n\nBhutan shares a similar religious culture to that of Tibet. While \nthe Gelukpa school rose to political power in Tibet (1690-1959), it \nwas the Drukpa Kagyu (or more simply, Drukpa) order ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ a derivative of \nthe Kagyu order ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that took political hold in Bhutan. The religious \nand musical life of Bhutanese Buddhists is dominated by the \ntraditions of both the Drukpa and Nyingmapa orders. \n\n\nThe re-released recordings do well to present the clarity of LevyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s \nthoughts, as well as the musical forms akin to both the Nyingmapa \nand Drukpa. The two CDs are divided into three parts, with the first \npresenting ritual music of the Drukpa. These songs were recorded in \nthe towns of Thimpu and Punashka, and draw upon dominant religious \nforms, found throughout Bhutan, as well as folk elements particular \nto region. The second section presents music from ritual dances from \nboth the Nyingmapa and Drukpa orders. Both monastic and public \nceremonies from two separate annual festivals are presented in the \nthird section. \n\n\nWhile the music on the two-disc set is presented as Tibetan Buddhist \nRites, it is also distinctly Bhutanese. The opening track, a \npropitiatory rite, serves as an invitation to Genyen: a protector \ndeity specifically associated with an area in Bhutan in the Thimpu \nValley. &quot;Chham gi Serkyem gi Yang (Tune for Offering of Consecrated \nDrink)&quot; also calls attention to the particulars of Bhutanese Buddhism: \ncalling attention to specific protector deities of Bhutan and Serkyem, \na Bhutanese take on beer. \n\n\nThe recordings also serve to present a majority of the various instruments \nused in both monastic and non-monastic song. The music of the shawm, a \ndouble-reeded long horn, the silayen (cymbals), dramnyen (seven-string \nlong-necked guitar) and zurlim (flute) share space on these albums. Yet, \nthe most spectacular musical element on this CD comes from the individual \nvoices and polytonal throat chanting of monks. The most compelling piece, \nin praise of the Nyingmapa scholar Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), is \nperformed by a manip, or wandering ascetic. \n\n\nLevy did a remarkable job here of allowing the music to be played and \npresented in its natural state, not as the subject for recording, but \nas an extension of the performance of everyday life.\n\n\nBy Corey Bills - 2005\n\n\nHiQuality: 320Kbps\n+Covers\n\n\nMISSING TRACK 20\nYou can download it here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4422025&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4422025&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d842c746d88e769aa4c97a5f45db5b7f2bd1b48","amp;dn":"TIBET+-+Tibetan+Buddhist+rites+from+the+monasteries+of+Bhutan+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d842c746d88e769aa4c97a5f45db5b7f2bd1b48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,132,44,116,109,136,231,105,170,76,151,165,244,93,181,183,242,189,27,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
