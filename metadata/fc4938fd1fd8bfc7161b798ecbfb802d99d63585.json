Holly was unique, his legendary status and his impact on popular music all the more extraordinary for having been achieved in barely 18 months. Among his rivals, Bill Haley was there first and established rock &amp; roll music; Elvis Presley objectified the sexuality implicit in the music, selling hundreds of millions of records in the process, and defined one aspect of the youth and charisma needed for stardom; and Chuck Berry defined the music's roots in blues along with some of the finer points of its sexuality, and its youthful orientation (and, in the process, intermixed all of these elements). Holly's influence was just as far-reaching as these others, if far more subtle and more distinctly musical in nature. In a career lasting from the spring of 1957 until the winter of 1958-1959 -- less time than Elvis had at the top before the army took him (and less time, in fact, than Elvis spent in the army) -- Holly became the single most influential creative force in early rock &amp; roll.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Down The Line (Undubbed) (Buddy &amp; Bob)\n02.Soft Place In My Heart (Undubbed) (Buddy &amp; Bob)\n03.You And I Are Through (Buddy &amp; Bob)\n04.Midnight Shift\n05.Love Me\n06.Don't Come Back Knockin'\n07.Blue Days, Black Nights\n08.Baby, Won't You Come Out Tonight\n09.I'm Gonna Set My Foot Down\n10.Changing All Those Changes\n11.Rock-A-Bye Rock\n12.Rock Around With Ollie Vee\n13.Girl On My Mind\n14.Ting-A-Ling\n15.Modern Don Juan\n16.Holly Hop (Undubbed)\n17.Brown-Eyed Handsome Man\n18.That'll Be The Day\n19.I'm Looking For Someone To Love\n20.Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Words Of Love\n02.Not Fade Away\n03.Everyday\n04.Ready Teddy\n05.Tell Me How\n06.Oh Boy!\n07.Listen To Me\n08.Peggy Sue\n09.I'm Gonna Love You Too\n10.It's Too Late\n11.Maybe Baby\n12.You've Got Love\n13.Rock Me My Baby\n14.Look At Me\n15.You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)\n16.Little Baby\n17.Rave On\n18.Well...All Right\n19.Take Your Time\n20.Fool's Paradise\n\n\nDisc 3\n\n01.Think It Over\n02.Heartbeat\n03.It's So Easy\n04.Lonesome Tears\n05.Love's Made A Fool Of You\n06.Wishing\n07.Early In The Morning\n08.Now We're One\n09.Reminiscing\n10.True Love Ways\n11.It Doesn't Matter Anymore\n12.Raining In My Heart\n13.What To Do (Undubbed)\n14.Peggy Sue Got Married (Undubbed)\n15.That Makes It Tough (Undubbed)\n16.Crying, Waiting, Hoping (Undubbed)\n17.Learning The Game (Undubbed)\n18.You're The One (Undubbed)\n19.Smokey Joe's Cafe (Undubbed)\n20.Dearest (Undubbed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n                 \n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc4938fd1fd8bfc7161b798ecbfb802d99d63585","amp;dn":"Buddy+Holly+-+Memorial+Collection+3CD+%282008%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc4938fd1fd8bfc7161b798ecbfb802d99d63585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,73,56,253,31,216,191,199,22,27,121,142,203,251,128,45,153,214,53,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
