It will teach you the proper terms and ways to apply rules that you might already know instinctively, yet not quite understand why they work the way they do.\r\n\r\nHere Is A Quick Preview Of What You'll Learn Inside...\r\n\r\nHappy accidents: This tip teaches you how to pay attention to the following rules in order to replicate happy accidents, and to be able to more purposefully craft your photographs.\r\nRule of thirds: This basic rule of composition is often the first to be learned in many art classes. It teaches you where to place points of interest in your photos.\r\nLeading lines: This tip shows you how lines can help move a viewerâ€™s eye around the composition.\r\nMove around: Donâ€™t just stick to one position or vantage point when you shoot. Moving around gives you access to different perspectives, which might actually bring better compositions than what you first assumed.\r\nHorizon lines: Different from leading lines, horizon lines break up the frame into two parts.\r\nShape: You will learn how to utilize shape that already exists in the frame, and how to create it where you want it using points of interest.\r\nForeground and background: This tip also mentions usage of mid-ground, and why you should take advantage of the entire depth of your frame, not just the immediate foreground.\r\nWeight: You can give weight to your photos by placing a â€œheavierâ€ subject to one side, or the top or bottom of a frame.\r\nJuxtaposition: Juxtaposition has to do with both the composition of your photo as well as the content of your photo. It basically means that you will place two opposite things side by side. This could be anything, from darkness and light, complementary colors, or things that have differing symbolic meaning.\r\nBalance: Balance, ironically, you may think, is achieved in odd numbers.\r\nTension: Tension also often has a lot to do with the content of a photo as well. You can create tension by examining the relationships of your subjects and composing them accordingly.\r\nFraming: Framing is so very important in composition. It can dramatically alter a viewerâ€™s perception of a scene. Also, especially with people, itâ€™s important not to cut part of your subject out of the frame.\r\nColor: Finally there is color, which can often be used as a crutch by new photographers. However, with this tip you will learn how to properly control it and use it to your advantage for maximum visual and emotional effect.\r\nAnd so much more!\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct Details:\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 402 pages\r\nPublisher: Sender Publishing (March 22, 2016)\r\nPublication Date: March 22, 2016\r\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services LLC\r\nLanguage: English\r\nASIN: B01DCP2RFU\r\n\r\nBTC - 1CZ4nTozpgfgqufWhiXDtBu9pVurd41SPz\r\n\r\nenjoy...\r\n\r\nYOURs INsincerely...\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n.:.Shailab.:.\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/shailab/\r\n \nhttps://kat.cr/user/shailab/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad4b2e0f5a21636e1b5131f127e4974e1505cb0e","amp;dn":"12+Photography+Composition+Rules+Your+Photos+Shine+James+carren","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad4b2e0f5a21636e1b5131f127e4974e1505cb0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,75,46,15,90,33,99,110,27,81,49,241,39,228,151,78,21,5,203,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
