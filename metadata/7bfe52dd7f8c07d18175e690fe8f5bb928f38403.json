They criticised it for being short on evidence and long on assertion and Darwin, being the honest scientist that he was, agreed with them. He knew that his theory was riddled with 'difficulties', but he entrusted future generations to complete his work and prove the essential truth of his vision, which is what scientists have been doing for the past 150 years.\n\nEvolutionary biologist Professor Armand Marie Leroi charts the scientific endeavour that brought about the triumphant renaissance of Darwin's theory. He argues that, with the new science of evolutionary developmental biology (evo devo), it may be possible to take that theory to a new level - to do more than explain what has evolved in the past, and start to predict what might evolve in the future.\n\nFile Name ..........: What_Darwin_Didn't_Know_20090126_BBC_Four.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 896.03 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: 01:28:38\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1285 KB/s\nResolution .........: 656 x 368\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.78:1\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nQuality Factor .....: 0.212 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bfe52dd7f8c07d18175e690fe8f5bb928f38403","amp;dn":"What+Darwin+Didn%5C%27t+Know+BBC4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bfe52dd7f8c07d18175e690fe8f5bb928f38403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,254,82,221,127,140,7,209,129,117,230,144,254,143,91,185,40,243,132,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
