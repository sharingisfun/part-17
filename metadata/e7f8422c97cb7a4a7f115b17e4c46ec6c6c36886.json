It was also a prolific album with a lot of left over material later released on B-sides.  For this release I've reordered the album a bit, and sequenced these B-sides into the album where I felt they fit the best.  It's a full CD worth of music now, and I think it's an even better album than what they released originally\n\n01 Return to Now\n02 All You Need is Now\n03 Blame The Machines\n04 Being Followed\n05 Leave a Light On\n06 Safe (in the Heat of the Moment)\n07 Girl Panic!\n08 The Man Who Stole a Leopard\n09 Networker Nation\n10 To Close to the Sun\n11 Too Bad You're So Beautiful\n12 Early Summer Nerves\n13 Other People's Lives\n14 Mediterranea\n15 Runway Runaway\n16 This Lost Weekend\n17 Before the Rain\n18 A Diamond in the Mind\n\nBonus:\n19 All You Need is Now (Youth Kills mix)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7f8422c97cb7a4a7f115b17e4c46ec6c6c36886","amp;dn":"Duran+Duran+-++All+You+Need+Is+Now+%28resequenced+and+expanded+by+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7f8422c97cb7a4a7f115b17e4c46ec6c6c36886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,248,66,44,151,203,122,74,127,17,91,23,228,196,110,198,198,195,104,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
