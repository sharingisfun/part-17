Released in February 1967, the song knocked The Beatles' &quot;Penny Lane&quot; out of the #1 slot for three weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. It was the group's only chart-topper. &quot;Happy Together&quot; reached #12 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1967. The song was written by Garry Bonner and Alan Gordon, former members of a band known as The Magicians. The song had been rejected a dozen times before it was offered to The Turtles, and the demo acetate was worn out.\n\nThe Turtles are an American rock group led by vocalists Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman. The band became notable for several Top 40 hits beginning with its cover version of Bob Dylan's &quot;It Ain't Me Babe&quot; in 1965. The group scored its biggest and best-known hit in 1967 with the song &quot;Happy Together&quot;.\n\nThe band, originally a surf-rock group called the Crossfires, was formed in 1965 in Westchester, California, by Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman. With the help of DJ and club owner Reb Foster, the Crossfires signed to the newly formed White Whale Records and adhering to the prevailing musical trend, re-branded themselves as a folk rock group under the name &quot;the Tyrtles,&quot; the intentional misspelling inspired by the Byrds and the Beatles. However, the trendy spelling did not survive long.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Together_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Together_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaLHpAAdF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaLHpAAdF&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 5200kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:02:59\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
