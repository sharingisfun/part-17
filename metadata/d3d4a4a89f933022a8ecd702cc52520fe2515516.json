This information is based on 45 years of experience training dogs. For the last 30 years I have studied the art of protection training dogs. I was a police K9 handler for 10 years, and was chairman of the training committee for the WI police dog association for a number of those years. I have bred German Shepherds for police service work for 28 years. During this time I have bred over 350 litters of working dogs. I have dogs from my kennel working in law enforcement, Search and Rescue and competing in Schutzhund all over this country. No one I know in the United States can make these claims. \n\nEveryone has an Opinion:\n\nI tell you these things for one reason. You found this web page because you have a problem with your dog. You have also found out that &quot;Everyone has an opinion on how to solve your problem.&quot; You only need to use Google for a few minutes to see this, or ask your neighbor or best friend. Everyone thinks they know what you should be doing. The problem is that very few people have the experience to back up their opinions. \n\nEvery year hundreds of thousands of dogs go through obedience training. The vast majority of dominant dogs that enter training classes come out of class just as dominant as before they started. The reason for this is that instructors and owners alike do not address issues of pack drive and rank within the pack. \n\nThese instructors and pet owners underestimate the genetic power of the &quot;PACK DRIVE GENES&quot; that flows through the veins of a family dog. Dogs, like wolves, seek to live in a family packs. A family pack can be one dog living with his human family, or multiple dogs and their human family.\n\nWhen the average pet owner gets a new dog the owner&amp;#039;s first goal is to show the dog how much he likes the dog. This is the absolute opposite of how dogs think. When a dog meets another dog they will always establish their rank with each other before they become friends and play (or fight) with the new dog.\n\nRank within the Pack:\n\nDogs instinctively try to establish a rank within their family pack. The vast majority of dogs would rather not be a pack leader. In fact, many become stressed when they are forced into that position by a human pet owner that does not practice proper pack procedures.\n\nDominant dogs are dogs that have problems with pack and rank issues. \n\nThis DVD was produced to help people analyze their dogÃƒÂ¢??s dominance and aggression problems. I provide the information for them to come up with a solution to those problems. These solutions include educating the owners on pack drive and rank drive. \n\nLearning to be a Pack Leader:\n\nOwners of dominant dogs don&amp;#039;t have an option, they must learn to become pack leaders. Unfortunately, many people are not themselves leaders in their normal lives. Becoming a pack leader for some people is a foreign concept. In my DVD I explain a logical protocol for these pet owners to follow that will result in their dogs&amp;#039; changing the way they view their position in the family pack.\n\nThis DVD is a project I have been working on for over 5 years. In my opinion it may be the most important training DVD I have ever produced. More dogs are given up for adoption or euthanized every year because of dominance and aggression problems than any other reason. Not all of these dogs are salvageable but I believe the vast majority of dominance problems can controlled so that those dogs can live a better life with their family pack. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d4a4a89f933022a8ecd702cc52520fe2515516","amp;dn":"Leerburg+Dealing+with+Aggressive+and+Dominant+Dogs+%28Dog+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d4a4a89f933022a8ecd702cc52520fe2515516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,212,164,168,159,147,48,34,168,236,215,2,204,82,82,15,226,81,85,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
