The position seems to be last row in the middle. Although the picture quality is blurred you have a good total view what's going on at the stage.\r\n\r\nNipote's notes.\r\nNice document, I remember very well this first night, after the Mermaid Theatre, in my first days of IFWT hub.\r\nThe video have a decent audio, but sometimes you can listen phone's interference so I decided to change the audio with the excellent DAT Master for this date (rec 4) taped or from Andreas C or from Rolf, not clear after 10 years.\r\nI made two small patches with original audio on the intro of A Pocketful Of Stones and on first notes of Wot's...Uh The Deal.\r\nI removed some parts of pre and post show.\r\n\r\n\r\n******************************************************************\r\n\r\nFOR TRADE OR GIVE AWAY ONLY - DO NOT SELL !!!\r\n\r\nMarooned65,Nipote and MkFloyd - 2016-03-10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c8ee8122664070e46b5fdf7f9fd86427136b34","amp;dn":"David+Gilmour+-+2006-03-10+-+Remember+This+First+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c8ee8122664070e46b5fdf7f9fd86427136b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,200,238,129,34,102,64,112,228,107,95,223,127,159,216,100,39,19,107,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
