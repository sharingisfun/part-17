The answer is NO.\nAs I go through my records and my mp3 collections, there will be a new instalment if I come across enough songs that fit these mixes.   So hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part 21 that features many cool minimal/dark wave tunes. Enjoy responsibly and seed! If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re new to this style or wondering what the heck is minimal wave, hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a useful write up:\n\nMainly characterized by minimal musical structures, the sound of Minimal Wave was hallmarked by the use of the analog synthesizers and drum machines that were manufactured in the 1970s and 1980s by Roland, Korg, Yamaha, ARP, Linn, Oberheim, Moog and Sequential Circuits (to name a few).\n\nMost of the Minimal Wave bands recorded in their home studios and created their own album artwork, which naturally paved the way for a D.I.Y. aesthetic to emerge. Generally, the musicians were influenced by avant-garde movements such as futurism and constructivism as well as by the literature of science fiction and existentialism. They had an innovative, unique approach to music-making, which was less polished than the music that appeared on mainstream charts during the same time period.\n\nThe Minimal Wave genre actually formed only several years ago, as a result of a resurgence of interest in the roots of pre-MIDI electronic New Wave (1978-1985), mainly from North America, Europe and Japan. This music is sometimes referred to as Minimal Electronic, Minimal Synth, Cold Wave, New Wave, Techno pop, or Synthpop, depending on the particular style, year, and location of the band. Many of these bands released their music in small batches on cassette or vinyl, and distributed it themselves.\n\nThis is What I Call Minimal 80s!
