Their sound changed much over the Hagar years, from Roth's hard-rocking ways to a more polished, commercial style dubbed &quot;Van Hagar&quot;. While the band continued to sell millions of records and go on sell-out tours, many fans of the Roth-era albums refused to accept Hagar as an adequate replacement, and disliked their new style. In 1996, Hagar left the band too, again because of disagreements with Eddie van Halen.\n\n\n1.  Red\n2.  (Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay\n3.  I've Done Everything For You\n4.
