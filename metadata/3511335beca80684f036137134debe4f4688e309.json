Twice a day for 40 days, Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat, but Saul and all the Israelites are afraid. David, bringing food for his elder brothers, hears that Saul has promised to reward any man who defeats Goliath, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his sling (Hebrew: Ã—Â§Ã–Â¸Ã—Å“Ã–Â·Ã–â€”Ã—Â¢Ã¢â‚¬Å½ qÃ„ï¿½laÃ¢â‚¬Ëœ) and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. &quot;The Philistine cursed David by his gods&quot;, but David replies: &quot;This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, and he will give you into our hand.&quot;[5]\n\nDavid hurls a stone from his sling with all his might and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites &quot;as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron&quot;. David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to Jerusalem, and Saul sends Abner to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, &quot;I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3511335beca80684f036137134debe4f4688e309","amp;dn":"The+Bible+Series+-+David+and+Goliath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3511335beca80684f036137134debe4f4688e309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,17,51,91,236,168,6,132,240,54,19,113,52,222,190,79,70,136,227,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
