Choi\nPencils:  Kenneth Lashley\nInks:  Tim Townsend and Andrew Henessy\nColors:  Nolan Woodard\nLetters:  Jeff Eckleberry\nCover:  Greg Land\n\nFrom the stunning sadism that brought you an entire brood of Deadpool droogs comes the chromosomal clusterhiccup that is Lady Deadpool. Agile, armed, and a howling she-lunatic, this recluse is robbed of the only thing she adores more than binge eating: cable TV. In an America ravaged by colossal debt and careening unemployment, the loss of the glowing idiot box is more than this girl can take. Why won't the government do anything? How is General America complicit? Was the genocide of all sitcom writers necessary? Should Wanda ransack the loins of a hot activist? Probably. 'Cause this Merc with a Mouth packs lipgloss. And it's sticky.\n\nThanks goes to XxxX for this release.\n\n\nNamora #1\nPublisher:  Marvel\nPublication Date:  June 23, 2010\n\nWriter:  Jeff Parker\nArtist:  Sara Pichelli\nColorist:  Rachelle Rosenberg\nLetterer:  Dave Sharpe\nCover:  Stephanie Hans\nVariant Cover:  Ramona Fradon\n\nThe powerful agent of ATLAS and Atlantean Princess known as Namora finds a missing colony of her aquatic people in the Barents Sea, and goes to bring them back to the new home of Oceana.
