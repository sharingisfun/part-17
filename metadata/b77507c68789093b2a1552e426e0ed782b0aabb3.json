This modest comedy-drama examines how the impending doom affects its cast. McKellar plays an architect who plans to meet the end alone at dinner. Others (Sandra Oh, David Cronenberg) make a suicide pact, but are caught apart and struggle to get together before the end. Another man (Callum Keith Rennie) pursues final sexual conquests and a milquetoast woman (Tracy Wright) strives to gain courage. Of course, the group ends up interacting.\n\nSummary from imdb.com\n\nSTARRING:\nDon McKellar\nSandra Oh\nJessica Booker\nCallum Keith Rennie\nGeneviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ve Bujold\nDavid Cronenberg\nRobin Gammell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77507c68789093b2a1552e426e0ed782b0aabb3","amp;dn":"Last+Night+1998+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77507c68789093b2a1552e426e0ed782b0aabb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,117,7,198,135,137,9,59,42,21,82,228,38,224,237,120,43,10,171,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
