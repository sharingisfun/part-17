The series was published by Marvel Comics for four issues between November 1995 and February 1996. It was a direct continuation, in terms of creative teams and storylines, of the previous Web of Spider-Man series in the same way that the other three primary Spider-Man series (The Amazing Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, and Spider-Man) were replaced by Amazing Scarlet Spider, Spectacular Scarlet Spider, and Scarlet Spider respectively during this period. While those series each reverted to their original titles after two issues (The quarterly Spider-Man Unlimited was similarly redone for one issue as Scarlet Spider Unlimited), Web remained a Scarlet Spider title for two additional issues before the series was cancelled entirely.\n\nRepacked: Changed all names of images contained in CBR archives to be consistent, to make sure all readers will get them all in the correct order.
