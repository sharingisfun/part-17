It is a technique with tremendous potential, especially in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields. This is the first book to be devoted to the topic and presents reviews by the world leaders in the field on the theory and development of the technique and current and potential future applications. &quot;Capillary Electrochromatography&quot; provides an excellent introduction to the field for graduates and professionals in industry and academia with an interest in separation science.[part of the RSC Chromatography Monographs series]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c59dead18d6031523e063fb37fae61edb4a6e15","amp;dn":"Capillary+Electrochromatography+%28RSC+Chromatography+Monographs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c59dead18d6031523e063fb37fae61edb4a6e15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,89,222,173,24,214,3,21,35,224,99,251,55,250,230,30,219,74,110,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
