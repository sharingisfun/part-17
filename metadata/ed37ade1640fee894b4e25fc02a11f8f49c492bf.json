A German doctor of dubious credentials finds a phone number in Travis' wallet, which belongs to his brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell). Walt is shocked to hear about his brother's condition, since no one in the family has seen or heard from Travis in four years; Walt flies to Texas to bring him home, only to find Travis wandering by the side of the road, and they begin the long drive back to Los Angeles, where Walt lives with his wife, Anne (Aurore Clement), and Hunter (Hunter Carson), Travis' seven-year-old son. At first, Travis refuses to speak and is oddly distant, but in time he begins to talk again, and when he arrives in California, he begins the painful process of reacquainting himself with his son and trying to reconcile with his wife, Jane (Nastassia Kinski).\n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087884/ | Rating: 7.9 / 10 (14,869 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Paris.Texas.1984.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.76 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 25mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 737 Kbps\nSource                           : Criterion NTSC DVD9\n                                       \nVideo.                          \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nBit rate                         : 1 254 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 1 284 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.151\nStream size                      : 1.27 GiB (72%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio.           \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 465 MiB (26%)\nLanguage                         : English\n\nChapters.\n\n00:00:00.000                     : Chapter 1\n00:07:06.559                     : Chapter 2\n00:18:48.227                     : Chapter 3\n00:25:10.475                     : Chapter 4\n00:38:08.252                     : Chapter 5\n00:51:26.716                     : Chapter 6\n00:58:43.152                     : Chapter 7\n01:10:58.721                     : Chapter 8\n01:26:03.458                     : Chapter 9\n01:34:55.823                     : Chapter 10\n01:40:50.677                     : Chapter 11\n01:49:11.177                     : Chapter 12\n01:58:53.926                     : Chapter 13\n02:19:39.971                     : Chapter 14\n02:23:12.884                     : Chapter 15\n02:25:10.318                     : Chapter 16\n\nKARiNA.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed37ade1640fee894b4e25fc02a11f8f49c492bf","amp;dn":"Paris.Texas.1984.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed37ade1640fee894b4e25fc02a11f8f49c492bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,55,173,225,100,15,238,137,75,78,37,252,2,161,31,143,73,196,146,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
