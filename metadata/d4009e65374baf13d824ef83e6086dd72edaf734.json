ASP.NET, a part of the Microsoft .NET platform, is a revolutionary programming framework that enables the rapid development of enterprise-class Web applications. It provides the easiest and most scalable way to develop, deploy, and run Web applications that can target any browser or device. In fact, these features are only a few of several that make ASP.NET developers' first choice for creating Web applications.\n\nASP.NET makes application development much easier than it was with classic ASP, and\nhence it has dramatically improved developers' productivity. ASP.NET enables you to\nprovide richer functionality to your Web applications by writing the least amount of code.\nThe best part is that ASP.NET enables you to select any of the available .NET\nprogramming languages. So, unlike classic ASP, in which you had to depend on\ninterpreted VBScript and JScript languages, ASP.NET provides a wide choice of\nprogramming languages.\n\nIn addition to the usual Web applications, ASP.NET allows you to create other types,which enables you to extend your applications' reach to new customers and business partners. For example, XML Web services enable sharing of data across the Internet regardless of the operating system and the programming language ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this certainly widens the reach of your applications. Also, ASP.NET provides you with mobile controls that enable your applications to target a large number of mobile Web devices.\n\n[...]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4009e65374baf13d824ef83e6086dd72edaf734","amp;dn":"ASP.NET+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4009e65374baf13d824ef83e6086dd72edaf734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,0,158,101,55,75,175,19,216,36,239,131,230,8,109,215,46,218,247,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
