Still I 've bought this film in Budapest, during my vacation there, July 2005, because I found the story fascinating and the actress Katalin KarÃƒÂ¡dy just WONDERFUL !!! I did see this movie first at the Budapest Open Air film-festival and was lucky to find this film on DVD in a small shop there. Well, if someone who does not understand Hungarian language at all finds this film well enough to even BUY the DVD, this should be a good recommendation ,right.Since the actress Katalin Karady is very famous in Hungary ( she went to USA after world war II and died there in the 1990s)I was disappointed not to find much more by her in Budapest.I found very little on her but besides the DVD I found some CDs with Hungarian songs, featured in her films too.So, this was a recommendation for HalÃƒÂ¡los Tavasz from a Dutch admirer of Karady !\n\nThis heart-stopper is perhaps the work of a pure GENIUS.\n\nAlthough setback by lack of technology and funds, this is still a masterpiece.\n\nTHE SUBTITLES ARE CUSTOM MADE, SPECIAL THANXXX TO MOVIOLA FOR HIS HELP IN CORRECTIONS!\n\nTechnical Specs\nSource: Internet, pirateisland.ws, feliratok.com \nGroup/Ripper: Special ThanxXx to errangon!\nVideo Format: AVI/XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 883 Kbps\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps \nAspect Ratio: 8:7\nResolution: 576 x 416\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.147\nAudio Format: Joint Stereo LAME 3.9\nAudio Bitrate: 129 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1101324201bf1f12a9de8edcd3db680384c0072d","amp;dn":"Deadly+Spring+%281939%29+Halalos+Tavasz+ENG+Sub+SWATura+-+OD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1101324201bf1f12a9de8edcd3db680384c0072d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,1,50,66,1,191,31,18,169,222,142,220,211,219,104,3,132,192,7,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
