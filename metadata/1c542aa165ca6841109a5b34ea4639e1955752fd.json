Low Risk = High Risk.\n00:41 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Low risk statements are boring and are chump like.\n01:02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Risk is a relative term.\n01:10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not the risk of getting rejected, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the risk of not getting laid.\n01:28 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stop reducing the risk of getting rejected, instead stop reducing the risk of going home alone.\n01:32 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Play to win. Play to have fun\n01:45 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Approach\n10:54 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Breakdown\n11:24 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ High Risk Move\n11:38 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Girls will think Ã¢â‚¬Å“Who is this guy doing something out of the ordinaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n11:46 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ More bold movements makes you look more confident\n11:59 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sitting and talking is better than standing and talking\n12:21 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sit with girls instead of talking down to them\n12:40 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ If they can dish it out, they should be able to take it as well\n12:52 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In the short run, these bold moves might get you rejected more; but in the long run youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get laid more.\n13:32 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s okay to tease girls.\n13:56 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Not poking fun can ruin the attraction.\n14:18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Most guys donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask girls right away on a date.\n14:28 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never too soon to go out on a date.\n14:53 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ If you forget the girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name, just ask.\n15:13 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Being blunt and honest shows the girl that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re confident\n15:45 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Make it apparent to who youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going after\n16:27 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hide your pride, put your ego aside, and go for it\n17:01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Be the guy that the girl will remember for the rest of her life\n17:18 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Try something youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never tried before\n17:28 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Be the guy who stands out from the crowd\n \nJason spins the notion that a high risk move is in reality, a low risk move. Too many guys out there think that the low risk move will lessen the chance of them getting rejected; when in fact this is further from the truth. In this episode, Jason explains why this is and what type of high risk moves you should be implementing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c542aa165ca6841109a5b34ea4639e1955752fd","amp;dn":"Simple+Pickup%3A+Project+Go+-+Week+36%3A+High+Risk+%3D+Low+Risk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c542aa165ca6841109a5b34ea4639e1955752fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,84,42,161,101,202,104,65,16,154,91,52,234,70,57,225,149,87,82,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
