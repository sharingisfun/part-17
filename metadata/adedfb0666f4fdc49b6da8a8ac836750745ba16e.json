People who use this method must be closely aligned with their health care team and highly motivated because it not only requires close scrutiny of blood glucose levels, but also vigilant monitoring of food intake and medication dosage, among other things. Intensive diabetes management has proven very effective and is now the rule in diabetes care. Intensive Diabetes Management is geared toward the healthcare practitioner who wants to implement this method on his or her patients.\n\nThis new edition is updated to cover the latest advances in medical research. New insights into diabetes and how they impact this particular treatment are covered. In addition, the data, guidelines, and procedures have been revised to reflect the newest positions of the American Diabetes Association's standards of care.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adedfb0666f4fdc49b6da8a8ac836750745ba16e","amp;dn":"Intensive+Diabetes+Management%2C+5E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adedfb0666f4fdc49b6da8a8ac836750745ba16e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,237,251,6,102,244,253,196,155,109,168,168,172,131,103,80,116,91,161,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
