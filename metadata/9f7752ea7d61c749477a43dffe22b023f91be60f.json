It reached number 12 in the United States \nand number one in the United Kingdom. The album was produced by Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits.\n\nBy this time, the band comprised Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher, and \nthe album features session musicians including Paul Franklin, Phil Palmer, Danny Cummings \nand American drummer Jeff Porcaro from Toto.\n\nDire Straits promoted the album with a gruelling world tour which lasted until the end of \n1992. The group disbanded in 1995, after which Mark Knopfler pursued a solo career and \nreleased his debut album Golden Heart in 1996 (not counting previously released soundtracks) \nand has released many solo records since.\n\n\n   1.
