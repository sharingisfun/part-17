It contains various tracks from the 4 years that Adam served as the composer for the show. Some are from earlier seasons, as well as some from later seasons. It does contain the 2 versions of I Dont Want to Wait that were composed for season 5, as well as the 2 themes that were composed for Dawson and Joey. This is very rare, so get it while you can! You will not be able to find this music anywhere else! It is very high quality, ripped accurately with EAC and LAME 3.97! Hope you enjoy it DC fans! Let me know what you think!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a39733824a335a57660b8abe78c88b4ebc6b606","amp;dn":"Adam_Fields-Dawsons_Creek_Rare_Score_Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a39733824a335a57660b8abe78c88b4ebc6b606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,57,115,56,36,163,53,165,118,96,184,171,231,140,136,180,235,198,182,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
