But Garcia-Fons writes in the short liner note to Oriental Bass that his dream of a bass &quot;half Gypsy and half Mauretanian&quot; takes the instrument through Andalusia and the Mediterranean. His compositions travel the same routes, drawing in trombone, flutes, accordion, flamenco guitar, tablas, lute, derbouka, daf, and more. The mix of hand percussion from Eastern Europe and North Africa with flamenco flairs makes Garcia-Fons&amp;#039;s music dizzying. This is very springy music, bouncing and bounding with choruses of horns pulsing powerfully. Few composers can balance, much less thrive in, the panoply of national styles that Garcia-Fons draws in with Oriental Bass.\n\n(Review by Andrew Bartlett from Amazon.com)\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a28d1e459a4cf1ccbcf92a553705bd068c174e","amp;dn":"Renaud+Garcia-Fons+-+Oriental+Bass%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a28d1e459a4cf1ccbcf92a553705bd068c174e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,162,141,30,69,154,76,241,204,188,249,42,85,55,5,189,6,140,23,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
