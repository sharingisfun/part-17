Finding itself on the wrong end of a trade dispute with the United States, and noting America's generosity in rebuilding the countries it had fought in World War II, Grand Fenwick's rulers hit upon the idea of declaring war on the U.S., losing, and then reaping a Marshall Plan-style handout. The plan, proposed by Grand Fenwick's prime minister (played by Peter Sellers), is approved by the monarch (also played by Peter Sellers), who dispatches an invasion force under the command of Grand Fenwick's hapless Field Marshal (also played by Peter Sellers). Their only mistake is not telling their invasion force leader that he's supposed to lose. Sellers lands in New York City during an air raid drill and finds the streets empty. He then proceeds to capture a brilliant scientist (David Kossoff), his assistant (Jean Seberg) and his awesome new weapon. The U.S. is forced to surrender!\n\n  Starring: Peter Sellers, Jean Seberg, William Hartnell, David Kossoff, Leo McKern.\n\n  Directed by: Jack Arnold.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 20min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 448","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f832fece43069fedadfc1bb687295c76b0f5b58","amp;dn":"The+Mouse+That+Roared+%281959%29+%28Peter+Sellers%2C+Jean+Seberg%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f832fece43069fedadfc1bb687295c76b0f5b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,131,47,236,228,48,105,254,218,223,193,187,104,114,149,199,107,15,91,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
