It was directed by Adrian Maben and recorded in the month of October with 24 tracks studio quality without a live audience.[1]\n\nThe performances of &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, and &quot;One of These Days&quot; were filmed from October 4, 1971 to October 7, 1971. The remaining songs were filmed in a Paris studio, along with additional front projection footage for insertion into the Pompeii performances.[2] The sequences in Paris were filmed in late 1971/early 1972, and can be distinguished by the absence of Richard Wright's beard. This version was released in theaters in September 1972 and is also included on the DVD edition as an extra feature. In August 1974, another version was released combining the original film with supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios. These sessions were actually staged for the film[citation needed], as the recording of the album had been completed when these sessions were filmed in January 1973 and the band was mixing the album at the time.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a7f1b405c5390535e3a694f134d8a543f96f2b","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd-+Live+at+Pompeii+-+The+Directors+Cut.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a7f1b405c5390535e3a694f134d8a543f96f2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,167,241,180,5,197,57,5,53,227,166,148,241,52,216,165,67,249,111,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
