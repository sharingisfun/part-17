The joint Italian-French productions were made with the involvement of the author himself, who wrote screenplays and the Italian dialogue for them, so they could be considered the &quot;official&quot; movie versions of the Don Camillo stories. Guareschi is quoted as warmly approving the way that stars Fernandel and Gino Cervi brought to life his two famous protagonists, the battling parish priest and Communist mayor of a small village in post-war Italy. \n\nAs the story opens, we meet hot-tempered Don Camillo complaining to the Lord about the recent election of the town's Communist contingent. The new Mayor, Peppone, is a particular thorn in Camillo's side, as the two have had an on-going rivalry which only escalates after the election. Conflicts abound: Peppone wants to have his son baptized &quot;Lenin,&quot; but Don Camillo has other ideas. The priest has been trying for years to scrape together the money for a town recreation center, then suddenly the Communists tap an unorthodox source of funds and build their own &quot;People's Palace.&quot; Peppone wants to fly the Red banner at a church procession, and he doesn't take Don Camillo's veto well. Don Camillo invests heart and soul into a soccer match between the church's team and the Party's. The Communists call a strike against the local landowners, but Don Camillo is determined to save the neglected farm animals. And somehow, amid all the sometimes-humorous, sometimes serious conflict, a Catholic &quot;Juliet&quot; and a Communist &quot;Romeo&quot; have fallen in love. Can priest and mayor lay down their fists and help them?\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Don Camillo.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 924 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 1 724 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.225\n      Stream size : 1.22 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 140 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192\n      Language : Italian\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043918/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0043918/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nItalian audio: English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by crasus, whom we thank\n\nJulien Duvivier - Don Camillo (1952)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15bc897d6d27d18eaf538565a4c2bfbd97d67e26","amp;dn":"Julien+Duvivier+-+Don+Camillo+%281952%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15bc897d6d27d18eaf538565a4c2bfbd97d67e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,188,137,125,109,39,209,142,175,83,133,101,164,194,191,189,151,214,126,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
