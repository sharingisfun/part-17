The pre-Slime band was called Screamer, and the post-Slime band is Ã¢â‚¬â€œ contrary to the occasional rumors Ã¢â‚¬â€œ not Emils (Slime backwards), but Rubberslime, with the member Elf. In 2010, the band reformed to play some concerts for their 30th anniversary.\n\nThe band was founded by Michael &quot;Elf&quot; Mayer (guitar), Eddi RÃƒÂ¤ther (bass) and Ball (Peter Wodok Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums). Some months later, Dirk &quot;Dicken&quot; Jora joined as vocalist. Christian Mevs joined the band in 1980 as second guitarist, and Ball left in 1981 and was replaced by Stephan Mahler. For the 2010 concerts Alex Schwers played bass guitar.\nDirk Jora at Rock in Caputh 2013\n\nNotable songs are &quot;Deutschland Muss Sterben (...Damit Wir Leben KÃƒÂ¶nnen)&quot; (Germany must die (... so we can live)) (an allusion to &quot;Deutschland muÃƒÅ¸ leben, auch wenn wir sterben mÃƒÂ¼ssen&quot; (Germany must live, even if we have to die), the inscription on the Kriegerdenkmal in Hamburg-Dammtor which is a line of the Soldatenlied by the German poet Heinrich Lersch), &quot;Bullenschweine&quot; (literally cop swines), &quot;Polizei SA/SS&quot; (police SA/SS), comparing police to the SA and SS and &quot;A.C.A.B.&quot; (&quot;All Cops Are Bastards&quot;).\n\nThey sang song against war (e.g. &quot;We Don't Need the Army&quot;), and they made a punk anthem with the song &quot;Hey Punk&quot;. They even produced songs against their government (&quot;They Don't Give a Fuck&quot;), their justice (&quot;Gerechtigkeit&quot; - means fairness), their police and their politicians (&quot;Sand im Getriebe&quot;). The song &quot;Yankees Raus&quot; (Yankees out) is against imperialism. The following years, neo-fascism in Germany was rising more and more, so they felt dutybound to sing against them.\n\nAlle gegen alle is the third album by the German Punk rock band Slime, released in 1983.\n\n1   Linke SpieÃƒÅ¸er   \n2   StÃƒÂ¶rtebeker   \n3   Untergang   \n4   Zu Kalt   \n5   Ihr Seid SchÃƒÂ¶n  \n6   Religion  \n7   Nazis Raus\n8   Sand Im Getriebe  \n9   Alle Gegen Alle   \n10  Die Letzten   \n11  Etikette TÃƒÂ¶tet  \n12  Ich Will Nicht Werden\n13  Tod   \n14  Junge Junge   \n15  Guter Rat Ist Teuer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925c6bb57f33d88264de0cb21cb4cca0798e20af","amp;dn":"Slime+-+Alle+gegen+Alle+%5B1983%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925c6bb57f33d88264de0cb21cb4cca0798e20af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,92,107,181,127,51,216,130,100,222,12,178,28,180,204,160,121,142,32,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
