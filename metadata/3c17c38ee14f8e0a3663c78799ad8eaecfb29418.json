If that's what you're looking for, you should opt for something a lot more clichÃƒÂ©d and conventional, like Sgt. Pepper's, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, or Electric Ladyland. Long a scarce collector's item, this features three extended &quot;raps&quot; by Dr. Leary over collage-like backing tracks of music (including brief samples of the Beatles and Pink Floyd), percussion, and electronics. The raps, which were guaranteed to make parents recoil in horror at the time, sound quaintly dated and silly today, rife with self-conscious mantras and revelatory declarations of breakthroughs into different planes of consciousness and celebrations of the wonders of drug use. This timepiece owes much of its collectibility to &quot;Live and Let Live,&quot; which features an unspectacular jam in the background by an all-star band of Jimi Hendrix (on bass), Stephen Stills, John Sebastian, and Buddy Miles. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Live And Let Live\n02.You Can Be Anyone This Time Around\n03.What Do You Turn On When You Turn On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c17c38ee14f8e0a3663c78799ad8eaecfb29418","amp;dn":"Timothy+Leary+-+You+Can+Be+Anyone+This+Time+Around+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c17c38ee14f8e0a3663c78799ad8eaecfb29418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,23,195,142,225,79,142,10,54,99,199,135,153,173,142,174,207,178,148,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
