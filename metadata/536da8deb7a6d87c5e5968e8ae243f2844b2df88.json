At the heart of the medieval legends surrounding this manuscript, lies the name of a forgotten prophet: Julius of Samaria. His story was lost to the mists of time... until now.\n\nThirty years after the death of Christ, Julius is a general, a legate of the Emperor, persecutor of Jews and Christians. But the crimes he is planning at the heart of the Empire will bring him to the edge of the abyss. Damned to live in hell, among his victims, Julius finds himself plunged headlong into the mysteries and prophecies surrounding the coming of the last messiah, the revelation of the word of god... and the advent of the age of darkness.\n\nenjoy\n\nThis is a prequel to The Third Testament, but you don't necessarily have to read that to read this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:536da8deb7a6d87c5e5968e8ae243f2844b2df88","amp;dn":"The+Third+Testament+-+Julius+I+%282010%29+%28phillywilly%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"536da8deb7a6d87c5e5968e8ae243f2844b2df88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,109,168,222,183,166,216,124,94,89,104,232,174,36,63,40,68,178,223,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
