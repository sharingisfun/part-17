It investigates whether war in Iraq was morally justified and whether coalition forces capturing and hanging its president were morally and legally acceptable internationally. The book further investigates the opinion of the UN, EU, and Islamic countries against the American unilateral invasion of Iraq. Additionally, it investigates the abuse of power in U.S. military detentions that caused a rise in worldwide condemnation of the U.S. The book also explores how the ultra-conservative Islamic insurgents of Bin Laden penetrated Northern Iraq, which intended to lay out the ignition of civil-war between the two main religious sects there, namely Sunni and Shia. The book examines the steps taken in the democratization and reconstruction of a devastated Iraq while the author highlights that democracy in Iraq has to evolve from within the Iraqi people, their culture, their traditions, and their social values.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“[A] very informative and highly readable book. . . .The bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s evenhanded treatment of complex issues surrounding the Iraq War as well as the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jargon-free writing style should appeal to specialists and nonspecialists alike. Summing Up: RecommendedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½--Choice\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is an important examination of the Iraq conflict. The strength of the book is in its completeness -- it provides excellent documentation of the events leading up to the conflict as well as a sophisticated discussion of key developments following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. It is written from an Arab perspective and is especially good at pointing out the American/Iraqi misunderstandings that have compounded and drawn out this sad tragedy. It has no ax to grind, just a thorough objective examination of the record. While other books have touched on various aspects of the conflict, this is by far the most complete.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½--Robert Looney, Distinguished Professor, Naval Postgraduate School\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nMohamed El-Shibiny is the former UNESCO Chief Technical Advisor for East Africa, the Philippines, and Qatar and as Regional Representative for the Middle East Gulf States as well as Dean of the Faculty of Education and Islamic Studies at Sultan Qaboos University and advisor to the Minister of Higher Education in the Sultanate of Oman.
