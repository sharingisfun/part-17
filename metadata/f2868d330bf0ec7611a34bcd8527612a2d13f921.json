N. Roquelaure.\nThe trilogy comprises The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's\nPunishment and Beauty's Release, first published individually in 1983,\n1984 and 1985 in the United States. They are erotic BDSM novels\nset in a medieval fantasy world, loosely based on the fairy tale\nof Sleeping Beauty. The novels describe explicit sexual adventures\nof the female protagonist Beauty and the male characters Alexi,\nTristan and Laurent, featuring both maledom and femdom scenarios\namid vivid imageries of bisexuality, homosexuality, ephebophilia\nand pony play. The trilogy was a bestseller, outearning the author's\ncommercially successful first novel Interview with the Vampire.\n\n\n\nBefore E.L. JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Fifty Shades of Grey and Sylvia Day's Bared\nto You, there was Anne RiceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New York Times best seller The\nClaiming of Sleeping Beauty\n\nIn the traditional folktale of &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; the spell\ncast upon the lovely young princess and everyone in her castle\ncan only be broken by the kiss of a Prince. It is an ancient\nstory, one that originally emerged from and still deeply\ndisturbs the mind's\nunconscious. In the first book of the trilogy, Anne Rice,\nwriting as A.N. Roquelaure, retells the Beauty story and\nprobes the unspoken implications of this lush, suggestive\ntale by exploring its undeniable connection to sexual\ndesire. Here the Prince awakens Beauty, not with a kiss,\nbut with sexual initiation. His reward for ending the hundred\nyears of enchantment is Beauty's complete and total enslavement\nto him . . . as Anne Rice explores the world of erotic yearning\nand fantasy in a classic that becomes, with her skillful pen,\na compelling experience. Readers of Fifty Shades of Grey will\nindulge in RiceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deft storytelling and imaginative eroticism,\na sure-to-be classic for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sequel to The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, the first of\nAnne Rice's (writing as A.N. Roquelaure) elegantly written\nvolumes of erotica, continues her explicit, teasing exploration\nof the psychology of human desire. Now Beauty, having indulged\nin a secret and forbidden infatuation with the rebellious slave\nPrince Tristan, is sent away from the Satyricon-like world of\nthe Castle. Sold at auction, she will soon experience the tantalizing\npunishments of &quot;the village,&quot; as her education in love, cruelty,\ndominance, submission, and tenderness is turned over to the\nbrazenly handsome Captain of the Guard. And once again Rice's\nfabulous tale of pleasure and pain dares to explore the most\nprimal and well-hidden desires of the human heart. Preceding\nthe visceral eroticism of E.L. JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Fifty Shades of Grey and\nSylvia Day's Bared to You, and even more haunting than her\nown novel Belinda, this second installment is not to be missed.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m7wYptRS8O8zVZatAtWXvtQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m7wYptRS8O8zVZatAtWXvtQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nBefore E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey and Sylvia Day's\nBared to You,, there was Anne RiceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s provocative take on\nthe timeless fairy tale Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sleeping Beauty. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ In the final\nvolume of Anne Rice's deliciously tantalizing erotic\ntrilogy, Beauty's adventures on the dark side of sexuality\nmake her the bound captive of an Eastern Sultan and a\nprisoner in the exotic confines of the harem. As this\nvoluptuous adult fairy tale moves toward conclusion, all\nBeauty's encounters with the myriad variations of sexual\nfantasy are presented in a sensuous, rich prose that\nintensifies this exquisite rendition of Love's secret world,\nand makes the Beauty series and incomparable study of erotica.\nIn it, Anne Rice, writing as A.N. Roquelaure, makes the\nforbidden side of passion a doorway into the hidden regions of the psyche and the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2868d330bf0ec7611a34bcd8527612a2d13f921","amp;dn":"The+Sleeping+Beauty+Trilogy++-+By+Anne+Rice%28Audio+read+by+George","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2868d330bf0ec7611a34bcd8527612a2d13f921","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,134,141,51,11,240,236,118,17,163,75,205,133,39,97,42,45,19,249,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
