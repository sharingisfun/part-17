Fast, easy, and fluid, Acorn provides the options you'll need without any overhead. Acorn feels right, and won't drain your bank account.\n\n* Take screenshots using Acorn and edit\n  them right away.\n\n* Chain together image filters to create\n  stunning effects.\n\n* Layer based image editing, an industry\n  standard.\n\n* Make new images and layers using your\n  built-in iSight.\n\n* Easy image and canvas resizing, just by\n  changing the size of your window.\n\n* Take advantage of every pixel of your\n  monitor with full screen image editing.\n\n* Tablet sensitive for pressure strokes and\n\n  using the tablet's eraser.\n* Vector shape and text layers.\n\n* Freeform, elliptical, rectangular, and\n  magic wand selections.\n\n* Gradients.\n\n* Create and apply custom text styles.\n\n* Control opacity and blending modes for\n  each layer.\n\n* Write plugins using the Python scripting\n  language, as well as in Objective-C.\n\n* GPU powered. The same graphics card\n  that makes your gaming experience\n  smooth, helps Acorn fly through the\n  toughest of graphics operations.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n* Fixed a bug where opening a zero length\n\n* PDF would crash Acorn.\n\n* Fix: Turned off support for automatic\n  background termination in Mac OS X10.7.\n\n* Fix: Hiding the palette with the tab key\n  and then trying to use the brush tool\n  where it just was would previously fail.\n\n* Now it works as expected. Hurray!\n\n* Fixed a bug where using the eyedropper\n  tool to pick up a color wouldn't draw with\n  the right color depending on what the\n  colorspace your image was in.\n\n* Fixed a bug where you would get an error\n  after a warning when canceling a save for\n  an image in a flat format when you had\n  multiple layers.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nIntel, Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a22f43ccc0d36676537fea25a6bcac9251870f4","amp;dn":"Acorn+v+3.1.1+with+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a22f43ccc0d36676537fea25a6bcac9251870f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,34,244,60,204,13,54,103,101,55,254,162,90,107,202,201,37,24,112,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
