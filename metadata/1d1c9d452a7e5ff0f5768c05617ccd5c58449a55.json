This is a great album, though not one that would necessarily appeal to the boomers that probably represent the majority of the SACD buying public.\r\nI won't bang on too much about what a wonderful album this is. But if you are unfamiliar with the album it is worth noting that it was somewhat derided (though quite popular) upon its release. Given the pejorative title of 'geek rock' and largely dismissed as artless.\r\nOnce you dig past the surface however, a different picture emerges. One full of wry self depreciating humour, intelligence and musical wit. As music fans themselves they do integrate references (sometimes just a bar or two) to create a richly individualistic musical whole.\r\nThis was produced by Ric Ocasek of The Cars fame and he did an excellent job on it in the first instance. Rob Loverde at Mofi has also done an excellent job on the mastering.\r\n\r\nThis is a rich, full and smooth sounding mastering, though you will have to wait until the last track for the audiophile piece de resistance that is 'Only in Dreams'. Mr Ocasek really went for it on that track. Overall, compression is minimal, the sound stage has depth and is commendably wide. Even though this is for the most part a pretty dense album sonically, the various instruments are also well delineated on the sound stage.\r\n\r\nHeartily recommended.
