Perhaps their coup is more analogous to an unexpected sloppy french kiss, in terms of saliva imagery. But Emergency &amp; I heralds a new era in rock and roll. Nothing else you own sounds like this record, yet everything you own echoes throughout. The Dismemberment Plans chromosomes carry the superior DNA of rock's genealogy through a natural sexual affair with music, not the cold process of cloning. The perfect nucleotides of the Pixies, Talking Heads, Fugazi, and Prince spindle in beautiful double-helixes throughout these 12 tracks. Specific moments recall Gang of Four (&quot;8 1/2 Minutes&quot;) or Radiohead (&quot;The Jitters&quot;), but this melange is wholly unique-- boiled down for synapse-popping flavor. Certainly some will scratch their heads, but innovation is never unanimously understood...&quot;\n\n(Brent DiCrescenzo, October 01, 1999 / Pitchforkmedia)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:010ae1837902dce2e132f02c99b099c174d53da8","amp;dn":"The+Dismemberment+Plan+-+1999+-+Emergency+%26+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"010ae1837902dce2e132f02c99b099c174d53da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,10,225,131,121,2,220,226,225,50,240,44,153,176,153,193,116,213,61,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
