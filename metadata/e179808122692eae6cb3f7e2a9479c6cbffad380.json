His tunes, recorded in the late '70s, weren't gathered together on an album until Shanachie's 1989 release Lamb's Bread, which promptly went out of print in 2000. when Lamb's Bread International came out on Blood and Fire, re-packaged the Walker tunes with 6 tracks by similarly obscure early '80s DJ Welton Irie.  The fact that Blood &amp; Fire felt the need to pad the album with the Irie tunes shows just how little Sylford Walker material there is available. \n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve used the vocal tunes from the B &amp; F CD and produced extended dub versions for, Lambs bread, Cleanliness is Godliness, Deuteronomy and Eternal Day. Using the corresponding tracks from B &amp; FÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Termination Dub vinyl release, let me know what you think.
