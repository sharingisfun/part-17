One documentary was broadcast every month, each focusing on a different incarnation of the Doctor. The series began in January with a First Doctor documentary and proceeded chronologically through the Doctors until it culminated with an Eleventh Doctor documentary in November. Each documentary was then followed up by a broadcast of a story featuring that Doctor, edited into an omnibus format (save the Eighth, the only doctor to have a single-parter from his era shown). All stories shown in the classic era prior to the 2005 revival have made their BBC America debut. \n\n\nThe Doctor Revisited Episode Descriptions Courtesy Of:\n\nInternet Movie Database (IMDB, &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2795780/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2795780/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand\n\nThe Television Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2013-01-27 - The Doctors Revisited - The 1st Doctor, William Hartnell (Video:H264 1920x1080, 1963kbps, 29fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 95kbps)\n\nThe First Doctor introduced viewers to an incredible show that is still popular 50 years later.
