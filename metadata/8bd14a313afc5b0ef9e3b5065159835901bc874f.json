With No Breaks (A laugh-out-loud comedy memoir)(EPUB+PDF+MOBI)[Team Nanban]tmrg\n\nNick Spalding | CreateSpace | 2012 | ISBN: 1461164095 | English | 168 pages | EPUB+PDF+MOBI | 0.25 MB + 1.2 MB + 0.35 MB\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nNick Spalding tried to write a book in 24 hours. Turns out that's impossible... it took 30!\n\nLife... With No Breaks is a unique, hilarious and heartfelt look at the modern world we live in, told by a master story-teller with much to say - and only a weekend to say it in.\nYou'll laugh out loud reading Nick's odyssey of non-stop writing in a collection of anecdotes, asides and stories - all dredged up from an over-stimulated brain functioning on caffeine, nicotine and the occasional chocolate biscuit.\nThe book is a conversation with you, and with Nick you'll venture into the thorny topics of love, life, sex, horribly timed bowel movements and a deathly fear of sponges (among many other things).\nAfter you've read Life... With No Breaks, you may never look at the world the same way again!\n\nReviews:\n\n&quot;You have to admire any writer who can produce a book as hilarious as this in just over a day. Bastard!&quot; - Stephen Leather, best selling author\n&quot;A collection of anecdotes, adventures and confessions that reads as satisfyingly as a novel. It's paced, it's organised, it's witty, it's wise, it's from the hip. There's never a dull moment.&quot; - Neil Marr, editor in chief, BeWrite Books\n&quot;I thought it was a scream of a book... and that was before I knew its history - that Nick had written the whole thing in a single sitting.&quot; - Mark Coker, Smashwords founder &amp; CEO\n&quot;This isn't a typical, run-of-the-mill memoir book. It's more an extremely funny series of short stories linked with Spalding's opinions and thoughts about the world. He wrote it in a single period of 30 hours, which is pretty incredible!&quot; - Amazon Reviewer\n\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                                           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/b506/153204b84.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/b506/153204b84.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bd14a313afc5b0ef9e3b5065159835901bc874f","amp;dn":"Life...+With+No+Breaks+%28A+laugh-out-loud+comedy+memoir%29%28EPUB%2BPDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bd14a313afc5b0ef9e3b5065159835901bc874f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,209,74,49,58,252,91,14,249,227,181,6,81,89,131,89,1,188,135,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
