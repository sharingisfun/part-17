Set against the grim backdrop of a country ravaged by race riots, mass unemployment, heavy-handed police tactics and the rise of Right Wing political factions, this compelling pseudo-documentary traces the early years of The Clash, the rise of a politician (Margaret Thatcher), and the story of one disaffected British youth, superbly portrayed by Ray Gange (the real-life inspiration for and subject of The Clash song Rudie Can't Fail). Above all, though, RUDE BOY is a priceless document of the devastating live power of The Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World evidenced by their incendiary performance filmed at the SWP/Anti-Nazi League Carnival in London's Victoria Park.\n\nScene Access:\nThere are 28 scene access points to navigate you through Rude Boy the Movie.
