There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid &quot;Na'vi&quot; in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an &quot;avatar&quot; identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.\n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 2.21 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 773 Kbps\nDuration: 2h 58mn\nSample: No \nSubtitles: English \n\nVideo Info\n\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate: 1 514 Kbps\nResolution: 1280 X 720 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9 \nQuality Factor(QF): 0.069\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nSource: 720p-CHD\n\nAudio Info\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 256 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 6 channels (Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE)\n\nScreen Shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/56000/photo-55833.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/56000/photo-55833.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/56000/photo-55834.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/56000/photo-55834.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c8a2546e7c507e5c42ab327f27561c84b7ea18","amp;dn":"Avatar+2009+Extended+Collectors+Edition+BRRip+720p+x264+-+TPB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c8a2546e7c507e5c42ab327f27561c84b7ea18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,200,162,84,110,124,80,126,92,66,171,50,127,39,86,28,132,183,234,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
