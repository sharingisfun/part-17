In the opening title track, he breaks down the very word Ã¢â‚¬Å“mantraÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as a concept- chanted and recited through history as Ã¢â‚¬Å“phonetic outreachÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and distilled here as an introduction to his own; Ã¢â‚¬Å“spoken word as a weapon.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da9b1a26f6ca54e90b4f3ce34bf3b5f7567d3a7","amp;dn":"Mantra+Power+Of+The+Spoken+FLAC-+Soon13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da9b1a26f6ca54e90b4f3ce34bf3b5f7567d3a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,169,177,162,111,108,165,78,144,180,243,206,52,191,59,95,117,103,211,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
