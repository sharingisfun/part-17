The Classic 1959-1966 Recordings\nRelease Date: September 18, 2007\nLabel: Ace Records (CDCHD 1180)\n\n\nLike many a journeyman bluesman, Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson led something of an itinerant recording life during much of his career, wandering from label to label in the 1950s and 1960s with just a little chart success. Untouchable! does a great service to collectors by assembling 27 tracks from 1959-1966, many of which, surprisingly, had not only never previously come out on CD, but had never been reissued in any form. While in general these are blues/R&amp;B crossover sides, there's more variety than one might think, and though the hopping between styles makes it a little uneven, it makes for a better listen in one gulp than you might expect. There's some relatively straight blues, particularly in the earlier sides; there are rather more blends of blues/R&amp;B with pop than many blues fans might realize exist, sometimes on covers of pop standards, and sometimes employing strings; and there are cuts, particularly in the mid-'60s selections, that verge on out-and-out soul. It's true that the three songs most likely to be familiar to general blues and rock fans are among the very best material here, those being &quot;Looking Back,&quot; which was covered by John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Peter Green on guitar); &quot;Cuttin' In,&quot; a 1962 Top Ten R&amp;B hit and one of Watson's most effective fusions of blues (with biting guitar) and orchestration; and &quot;Gangster of Love,&quot; one of Watson's signature tunes (though this 1963 King single, fine as it is, is not his original version). But everything here is at least OK, and much of it is above average to excellent, even on some tracks where the influences of others like Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry, the Olympics, the Temptations, and Ray Charles are obvious. There might be a little less guitar pyrotechnics than some straight-ahead blues fans would like, and it's unfortunate that a few interesting cuts referred to in the liner notes from this period were not available for licensing. But overall it's a solid overview of a time when Watson was among the more interesting (and certainly overlooked) artists building bridges between the blues, R&amp;B, and soul. --Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\n\nVeteran photographer Brian Smith has good reason to remember the night of 3 April 1965 that R&amp;B legend Johnny Ã¢â‚¬Å“GuitarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ Watson played ManchesterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Twisted Wheel club, with sidekick- Larry Williams, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was the first time I took out my wife [39 years married, last June] - though I still stuck to the job in hand and buggered off to the Ã¢â‚¬ËœWheel All-NighterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ after I had put her on the bus home. I got a few decent black and whites on at Twisted Wheel, and then a couple at the Princess Club, same week: on stage, and some posed too.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSome of BrianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best shots adorn the booklet of this Ace collection of what might be termed JGWÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmissing yearsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - those between his first flurry of success as a guitar- crushing mid-50s bluesman, and his reivention as a 60s soul hero. For the first half of the 1960s, Johnny bounced from label to label in an effort to recapture the chart success that he had first found with ModernÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RPM subsidiary. He had few hits along the way, but he made a whole lot of great music and Ã¢â‚¬Å“UNTOUCHABLE!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ represents the first time that almost all of it has been gathered together. \n\nWatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s longest residency of these years was with King Records, for whom he cut the sublime CuttinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ In Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which became his biggest hit of the 1960s, in 1961. He also cut the definitive reading of his anthem Gangster Of Love for King, as well as a bunch of highly-potent sides that have since become cherished items among those who collect New Breed R&amp;B in all its forms. Prior to King, he also made great one-off singles for Class and Arvee that successfully approximated the sound of his peers the Hollywood Flames (who backed him on his Class 45) and the Olympics (who probably did the same on our title track). The original version of his classic, Looking Back, is here, as are a clutch of post King sides that nowadays sell for between Ã‚Â£200 (AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Gonna Move) and Ã‚Â£400 (Big Bad Wolf) among todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Northern Soul hardcore. All in all, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Untouchable!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ paints a fascinating picture of a man who had the will, and found the way, to bridge two eras of black music, prior to his greatest success. \n\nWith another must-have item for blues and soul collectors, young, cool and in his prime, here is the late, great Johnny Ã¢â‚¬Å“GuitarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Watson. --Tony Rounce, Ace Records\nTrack Listing:\n1.
