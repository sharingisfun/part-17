The new edition covers the evolution of wireless communications technologies and systems. The major new topics are OFDM (orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing), MIMO (multi-input multi-output) systems, frequency-domain equalization, the turbo codes, LDPC (low density parity check code), ACELP (algebraic code excited linear predictive) voice coding, dynamic scheduling for wireless packet data transmission and nonlinearity compensating digital pre-distorter amplifiers. The new systems using the above mentioned technologies include the second generation evolution systems, the third generation systems with their evolution systems, LTE and LTE-advanced systems, and advanced wireless local area network systems.\n\nThe second edition of Digital Mobile Communication:\n-  Presents basic concepts and applications to a variety of mobile communication systems\n-  Discusses current applications of modern digital mobile communication systems\n-  Covers the evolution of wireless communications technologies and systems in conjunction with their background\n\nThe second edition of Digital Mobile Communication is an important textbook for university students, researchers, and engineers involved in wireless communications.\n\nAbout the Author\nYoshihiko Akaiwa is a leading researcher in the digital mobile communication field. Currently he works as a consultant regarding communications technologies. He worked as a researcher for over twenty years at the NEC Corporation and was a professor at Kyushu University. \n\nCONTENTS\nPreface to the Second Edition xiii\nPreface to the First Edition xv\n1 Introduction 1\n2 Signal and Systems 9\n3 The Elements of Digital Communication System 127\n4 Mobile Radio Channels 189\n5 Elements of Digital Modulation 219\n6 Digital Modulation/Demodulation for Mobile Radio Communication 281\n7 Other Topics in Digital Mobile Radio Transmission 355\n8 Equipment and Circuits for Digital Mobile Radio 493\n9 Digital Mobile Radio Communication Systems 543\nIndex 613\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/webykj7l7/Introduction_to_Digital_Mobile_Communication_2n.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/webykj7l7/Introduction_to_Digital_Mobile_Communication_2n.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaadd6388bbcc9e5afe7a8686ae6a2f898b86374","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Digital+Mobile+Communication+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaadd6388bbcc9e5afe7a8686ae6a2f898b86374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,173,214,56,139,188,201,229,175,231,168,104,106,230,162,248,152,184,99,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
