But there is no peace among the survivors, a few of whom are immune to the &quot;blood death,&quot; while the rest desperately seek a cure. All of this is only background for this well-crafted exercise in breathless sensationalism.\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17d257f18bb182987fb38037b9adb4486b7cc0bf","amp;dn":"%5C%2748+-+James+Herbert+%5BUnabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17d257f18bb182987fb38037b9adb4486b7cc0bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,210,87,241,139,177,130,152,127,179,128,55,185,173,180,72,107,124,192,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
