In a series of 500 nearly wordless, highly informative step-by-step procedurals, readers learn how to do hundreds of useful (and fascinating and important and sometimes downright bizarre) tasks, including: Perform CPR, dance the tango, pack a suitcase, win a bar bet, play the blues, make authentic sushi rolls, fight a shark . . . and 493 more essentials of modern life. Packed with useful hands-on reference material, Show Me How is a work of art that just happens to also be an indispensable real-life resource. \n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 320 pages \nPublisher: Harper Design; First Edition edition (October 28, 2008) \nLanguage: English \nISBN-10: 0061662577 \nISBN-13: 978-0061729621 \nAverage Customer Review: 4.4 out of 5 stars  \nAmazon Best Sellers Rank: #16,267 in Books ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6533551dfd4eda1f67c414411d46c066bb6e82","amp;dn":"Show+Me+How+-+500+Things+You+Should+Know+-+Instructions+For+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d6533551dfd4eda1f67c414411d46c066bb6e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,101,51,85,29,253,78,218,31,103,196,20,65,29,70,192,102,187,110,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
