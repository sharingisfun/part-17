Directed by Jun Fukuda with special effects by Sadamasa Arikawa (supervised by Eiji Tsuburaya), the film starred Tadao Takashima, Akira Kubo, and Akihiko Hirata. The 8th film in the Godzilla series, it was also the second of two island themed Godzilla adventures that Toho produced with slightly smaller budgets than most of the Godzilla films from this time period. Continuing the trend of shifting the series towards younger audiences, the film introduced an infant Godzilla named Minilla.\n\nThe film was released straight to television in the United States in 1969 by the Walter Reade organization.\n\n\nFormat                         : AVI\nFile size                      : 700 MiB\nDuration                       : 1h 26mn\nOverall bit rate               : 1 137 Kbps\nWidth                          : 640 pixels\nHeight                         : 272 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                     : 23.976 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b16cf7126557c49ca12fbc1f4a48ba21f5b2ea08","amp;dn":"Son+Of+Godzilla+%281967%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b16cf7126557c49ca12fbc1f4a48ba21f5b2ea08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,108,247,18,101,87,196,156,161,47,188,31,74,72,186,33,245,178,234,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
