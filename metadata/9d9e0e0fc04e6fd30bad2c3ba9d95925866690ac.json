Il Segreto.\nNot only did Piovani earn his first widespread notice for his contributions to Marco Bellocchio's 1970 effort Nel Nome del Padre, but the project inaugurated an ongoing creative collaboration with the director that included the pictures Salto Nel Vuoto and Matti da Slegare.\nThe composer was also a favorite of the brothers Taviani (La Notte di San Lorenzo), Mario Monicelli (Speriamo Che Sia Femmina), Nanni Moretti (Caro Diario), and the renowned Federico Fellini, a partnership that included the global hits Intervista and Ginger e Fred.\nDespite his growing renown, rumors circulated that Piovani was in fact little more than an alias for Italian film maestro Ennio Morricone, a misconception Piovani often chooses to exploit during his public appearances.\nSuch gossip largely subsided when 1998's Holocaust fantasy La Vita ÃƒÂ¨ Bella earned the composer his first Oscar, although he lost out on a Grammy Award to composer Randy Newman.\nPiovani also won the Ciak d'Oro in 2001 for his work on Moretti's La Stanza del Figlio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d9e0e0fc04e6fd30bad2c3ba9d95925866690ac","amp;dn":"Nicola+Piovani+-+Ginger+%26amp%3B+Fred+OST+%282014%29+%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d9e0e0fc04e6fd30bad2c3ba9d95925866690ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,158,14,15,192,78,111,211,11,173,44,59,169,217,89,37,134,102,144,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
