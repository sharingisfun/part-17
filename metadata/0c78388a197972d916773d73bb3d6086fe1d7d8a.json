A fair exchange. So it's with great regret that we pass on news\nthat the Californians now make Gene Simmons and co seem like\nBaudelaire.\n\nWell, not quite, but since the five-year gap between their second and\nthird records, Weezer have become both prolific and a near-parody of\nthemselves. While 2002's Maladroit breathed life into the notion that\nCuomo could re-establish himself as one of the great rock songwriters\nof his generation, it was followed by the dreadful pop-punk of Make\nBelieve and last year's garbled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“red albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, their third self-titled\nLP. This is a band in decline and, as if to prove it, they've made\nRaditude.\n\nRecorded with a mix of other songwriters including Jermaine Dupri,\nJacknife Lee and the All-American Rejects' Nick Wheeler, this is a\nstrange album indeed. Let us not forget that Rivers is smart guy, a\nHarvard graduate no less, so hearing him sing for half an hour and in\nclunky terms abut the myriad joys of &quot;partying all night&quot; like a\n17-year-old is fairly perturbing. The Girl Got Hot, the tale of a\nclassmate from high school who, duh, &quot;got hot&quot;, is the worst example of\nthis douchebaggery. This is a band better than appealing to the basest\nof FM radio power-pop desires, surely.\n\nThere are a few good moments ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ particularly the single and first track\n(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To, which borrows A\nTown Called MaliceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bassline to tell the story of an anxious teenage\nlove, and Love Is The Answer, a rock/classical-Indian fusion which\nfeatures sometime Jai Ho singer Amrita Sen and was written for Make\nBelieve before being recorded by Sugar Ray and resurrected here. Lil\nWayne crops up to for a guest rap too, on the self-explanatory Can't\nStop Partying. But these detours aren't enough to rescue proceedings.\n\nIt's the songs reused from Cuomo's Alone II demo compilations that are\nby far the best things here, and it's the sensitivity in these tracks\nthat made early Weezer so great and, mainly, whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s missing elsewhere\non Raditude. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album seemingly designed to garner royalties from\nfuture films in the American Pie franchise; the sound, almost literally\none assumes, of a band in a midlife crisis.\n\nPrevious release nuked for stolen from torrents, here is a &quot;proper&quot;\nincluding scans etc. I think it has different bonus tracks too, but I\ncan't be arsed to look.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f98a908b9cb9918c8a91d79890&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c78388a197972d916773d73bb3d6086fe1d7d8a","amp;dn":"Weezer-Raditude-%28Deluxe_Edition%29-2CD-2009-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c78388a197972d916773d73bb3d6086fe1d7d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,120,56,138,25,121,114,217,22,119,61,115,187,61,96,134,254,29,125,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
