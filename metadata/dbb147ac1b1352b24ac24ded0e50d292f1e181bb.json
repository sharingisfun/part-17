It was released as a single in January 2000, peaking at number 55 in the UK Singles Chart. It was the last song to which Dury would contribute his voice, before he died in March 2000. \n\nOne interesting thing to note about the video is that Lee Thompson looks the same character-wise as in his Crunch! single It's OK, I'm a Policeman. \n\nMadness are a British pop/ska band from Camden Town, London, that formed in 1976. The band continue to perform with their most recognised line-up of seven members, although their line-up has varied slightly over the years. They were one of the most prominent bands of the late-1970s 2 Tone ska revival. \n\nMadness achieved most of their success in the early to mid 1980s. Both Madness and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade, holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts. However, Madness achieved this in a shorter time period (1980 - 1986). \n\nThe Nutty Boys were Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman of Madness. The name &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; was actually the name of their album, while the new band was called &quot;Crunch!&quot;. The posters for their first concert mistakenly listed the band as &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; instead of &quot;Crunch!&quot;, and the name accidentally stuck. While the members of the band Madness were nicknamed &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; as a whole, this section lists only the work released by Thompson and Foreman under &quot;The Nutty Boys&quot; name in the early 1990s. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_Fed_Fred&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_Fed_Fred&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAFMJAaEK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/gAFMJAaEK&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:39\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
