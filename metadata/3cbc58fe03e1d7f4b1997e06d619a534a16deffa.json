Irish-born but Yorkshire-raised, she played fiddle in \n\nher fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band in Ireland. Trained at Liverpool Institute for Performing \n\nArts, she started composing when working on a theatre show that needed \n\nsongs. On the EP Rebox, her only previous release, she accompanied herself \n\nwith a hand-cranked music box, incongruously covering classics by Cocteau \n\nTwins, New Order, OMD and Soft Cell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mostly songs older than the singer \n\nherself.\n\nIn complete contrast, The Broken Wave features eight Peel originals plus two \n\ntraditional Irish songs. Her compositions avoid the conventional \n\nverse-chorus-verse form, their restrained melodies giving each its own \n\ndistinctive charm. They vary in mood, covering subjects from the joy and \n\nhope of falling in love through to the pain and loss of betrayal.\n\nPeelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lyrics often have a mysterious, poetic quality. Rather than tackling a \n\nsubject head-on, she tends to employ allusions and metaphors. Her insights \n\ninto the break up of relationships display a maturity rare in a 28-year-old. Her \n\nvoice is her other great asset. Although occasionally reminiscent of other \n\nsingers, it is unmistakably unique. Crucially, its fragile beauty ideally conveys \n\nthe longing and yearning contained within the complex emotions of the songs.\n\nOn Solitude, addressed to a lost love, it brings a lump to the throat to hear \n\nher deliver these lines in a frail, vulnerable voice, &quot;The look on your face as \n\nshe moves near / My eyes start to burn, oh why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t they close / I just want \n\nto see why she is better than me, better than me / Better than me.&quot; Ouch.\n\nThe accompanying music is folk-pop with just enough quirky edginess to keep \n\nit sounding fresh. Producer Mike Lindsay achieves a fine balance between \n\nsensitively showcasing PeelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice and upstaging it, only rarely overdoing the \n\ndrums. Peel plays violin and piano, as well as deploying that music box on the \n\ntwo Irish songs. On Solitude and the equally poignant DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Kiss the Broken \n\nOne, subtle string arrangements by Nitin Sawhney complement and enhance \n\nthe vocals without being a distraction.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/07/hannah-peel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/07/hannah-peel/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cbc58fe03e1d7f4b1997e06d619a534a16deffa","amp;dn":"Hannah+Peel...The+Broken+Wave%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cbc58fe03e1d7f4b1997e06d619a534a16deffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,188,88,254,3,225,215,244,177,153,126,6,214,25,165,52,161,109,239,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
