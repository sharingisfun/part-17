But now the sun has turned the entire world into baked and barren wasteland. Forests are scorched. Animal carcasses line the roads. Even the nights are dazzling bright. Marie, her little sister Leonie and Phillip are heading for the mountains in a car with covered windows. Rumor has it there is still water there. Along the way they run into Tom, a first-rate mechanic that becomes indispensible. But can they trust him? Tension grows in the small group. As if things weren't bad enough, they are lured into an ambush. Their real battle for survival begins.\n\n\n\nTitle ______________ Hell\nSource _____________ Blu-ray\nRelease ____________ 05-07-2012\nRipper _____________ Zoo\nRuntime ____________ 01:29:27\nVideo ______________ x264 @ 2,208 Kbps\nAudio ______________ AC3 6CH @ 448 Kbps\nResolution _________ 1280 x 544\nGenre ______________ Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nLanguage ___________ German\nSubtitle ___________ English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d876bfef4a808f32446ec4d64b9fc7cc768a874f","amp;dn":"Hell.2011.720p.BDRip.x264.AC3-Zoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d876bfef4a808f32446ec4d64b9fc7cc768a874f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,118,191,239,74,128,143,50,68,110,196,214,75,159,199,204,118,138,135,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
