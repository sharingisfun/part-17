Months later, Ewaen and friends are finally enrolled as freshmen at the University of Benin. Their routine now consists of hanging out in a parking lot trading jibes, chasing girls and sex, and learning to manage the staff strikes and crumbling infrastructure. But Nigerian campuses in the 1990s can be dangerous places, too. Violent confraternities stake territories and stalk for new recruits. An incident of petty crime snowballs into tragedy...\n\nFine Boys is Eghosa ImasuenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second novel. In the witty, colloquial style fast becoming his trademark, Imasuen presents everyday Nigerian life against the backdrop of the pro-democracy riots of the 1980s and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90s, the lost hopes of June 12th, and the terror of the Abacha years. Indeed Fine Boys is a chronicle of not just a time in Nigeria, but its post-Biafran generation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:665d738082e9e25a641ad9f096fd734fd05933a2","amp;dn":"Fine+Boys+-+Imasuen%2C+Eghosa.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"665d738082e9e25a641ad9f096fd734fd05933a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,93,115,128,130,233,226,90,100,26,217,240,150,253,115,79,208,89,51,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
