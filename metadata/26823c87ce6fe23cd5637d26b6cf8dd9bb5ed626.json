Working his way slowly up the ladder to success, Power achieves fame when he is praised to skies by fatuous, fickle critic Laird Cregar. A country boy at heart, Power finds himself way over his head with sophisticates, and is soon torn between his pious and faithful wife Linda Darnell and sexy, mercenary Rita Hayworth. It is Darnell, however, who comforts Power after his final, fatal goring in the bull ring. The film's best scenes depict the curious combination of horror and fascination with which bullfighting aficionados treat this most barbaric of &quot;sports.&quot; Blood and Sand was previously filmed in 1922 with Rudolph Valentino; a Valentino contemporary, Alla Nazimova, plays Power's mother in the remakes. Portions of this film turned up as stock footage in the 1945 Laurel and Hardy comedy The Bullfighters.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033405/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033405/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-24488&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-24488&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector:\nRouben Mamoulian\n\n\n\n\n\tTyrone Power\t... \tJuan\n\tLinda Darnell\t... \tCarmen Espinosa\n\n\tRita Hayworth\t... \tDona Sol\n\n\tAlla Nazimova\t... \tSenora Augustias (as Nazimova)\n\n\tAnthony Quinn\t... \tManolo de Palma\n\n\n\nVideo #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 850 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 14.985 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.185\n      Stream size : 759 MiB (86%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L1\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 - 128 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 1-pass CBR\n      Duration : 2h 5mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 114 MiB (13%)\n\n\n\n     Please seed at least as much as you D/L.\n      =======================================\n     Thanks \n\n      John","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26823c87ce6fe23cd5637d26b6cf8dd9bb5ed626","amp;dn":"Blood+And+Sand+%281941%29+-+Tyrone+Power+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26823c87ce6fe23cd5637d26b6cf8dd9bb5ed626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,130,60,135,206,111,226,60,213,99,125,38,182,207,141,217,187,94,214,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
