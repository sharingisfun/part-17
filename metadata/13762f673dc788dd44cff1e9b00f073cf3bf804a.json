Slidin' Home\n\nAfter years of knocking around the Washington, D.C.-area circuit, local guitar legend Danny Gatton finally got to cut his first album for a major label. It was indeed worth the wait, spot-welding blinding speed and immaculate chops that went in a million different directions (jazz, country, rockabilly, blues, you name it) to a musical sensibility that made this all-instrumental album a whole lot more than just yer average fretboard wanking jam-fest. Gatton's Telecaster really shines on diverse material ranging from Martin Denny's &quot;Quiet Village&quot; to the roadhouse shuffle &quot;Funky Mama&quot; to the off-the-wall rendition of the theme to The Simpsons. Kudos to Elektra for having the corporate balls to put this out; short, chunky, and middle-aged, Danny Gatton was a bona fide guitar hero for the '90s, putting the lie to the hard canard that only speedburner metal mega-hair dudes can make the front covers of the guitar mags.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13762f673dc788dd44cff1e9b00f073cf3bf804a","amp;dn":"Danny+Gatton+-+88+Elmira+Street+%5B1991%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13762f673dc788dd44cff1e9b00f073cf3bf804a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,118,47,103,61,199,136,221,68,207,241,233,176,15,7,60,243,191,128,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
