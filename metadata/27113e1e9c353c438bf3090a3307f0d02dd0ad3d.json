However, it's been a while since \nthey've come back together, which is all about to change. When one of their own, \nReuben Tishkoff, builds a hotel with another casino owner, Willy Bank, the last \nthing he ever wanted was to get cut out of the deal personally by the loathsome Bank. \nBank's attitude even goes so far as to finding the amusement in Tishkoff's misfortune \nwhen the double crossing lands Reuben in the hospital because of a heart attack. \nHowever, Danny and his crew won't stand for Bank and what he's done to a friend. \nUniting with their old enemy Benedict, who himself has a vendetta against Bank, \nthe crew is out to pull off a major plan; one that will unfold on the night Bank's \nnewest hot spot opens up. They're not in this for the money, but for the revenge.\n\nGeneral           : Oceans.Thirteen.2007.720p.Bluray.x264.anoXmous.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 801 Kbps\nLength            : 700 MiB for 2h 2mn 9s 332ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 734 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 528 (2.424) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 63.8 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Sub in a .srt format:\n\nOceans.Thirteen.2007.720p.Bluray.x264.anoXmous_eng.srt\nOceans.Thirteen.2007.720p.Bluray.x264.anoXmous_swe.srt\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCrime | Thriller                  Ratings: 6.9/10\n                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496806/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496806/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis work very fine with PSP and XBOX\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nScreens made by Media Player Classic:\n                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/0d6dbd172982999&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/0d6dbd172982999&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*********** THX to anoXmous for this and let them coming :=)************\n\n\n--FUCK YOU --HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gsta domstolen__The courts exist for the citizens--FUCK YOU --","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27113e1e9c353c438bf3090a3307f0d02dd0ad3d","amp;dn":"Oceans.Thirteen.2007.720p.Bluray.x264.anoXmous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27113e1e9c353c438bf3090a3307f0d02dd0ad3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,17,62,30,156,53,60,67,139,243,9,10,51,7,240,208,45,208,173,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
