In preparing his theatrical cut, director Rainer Werner Fassbinder shaved away the subplots and supporting characters to focus tightly on the story of railway stationmaster Bolweiser (Kurt Raab) and his philandering wife Hanni (Elisabeth Trissenaar). Set in late-1920s Bavaria, Bolweiser is a Nazi party man surrounded by grotesque, toadying underlings at the station but is pathetically servile to his increasingly frustrated, unhappy wife. Disgusted by her weak-willed husband, she finds passion in the arms of the butcher. Bolweiser ignores the town gossip and even perjures himself to defend his wife in a trial--an act which later dooms him. Exquisitely photographed (by Michael Balhaus) and beautifully designed, Fassbinder's lush, romantic style suffuses his caustic portrait of the self-destructive Bolweiser (a painfully perfect performance by Raab), and the petty small-town citizens who seal his fate. Even as Bolweiser sinks to the depths of self-pity, Fassbinder's gorgeous, shimmering canvas makes the small-minded doings look so much more tawdry.\n\n__________________________________________\n\nDVDrip\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:49:51\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 512x384\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 736 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,15 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 154 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5caed105fbb2b38228076c73d35b021dc175d044","amp;dn":"The+Stationmaster%5C%27s+Wife+%28Rainer+Werner+Fassbinder+-+1977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5caed105fbb2b38228076c73d35b021dc175d044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,174,209,5,251,178,179,130,40,7,108,115,211,91,2,29,193,117,208,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
