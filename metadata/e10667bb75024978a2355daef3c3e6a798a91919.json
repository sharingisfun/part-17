We cannot do without salt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ every living creature needs the essential sodium in salt. This book explores the history and uses of salt, proving that it is much more than just a white granular substance you sprinkle from a salt cellar on to your food. In Roman times, it was so highly valued that soldiers were paid in salt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is where we get the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœsalaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ from. Salt also has many important industrial uses, such as producing plastics, bleaching cotton and linen, disinfecting water, manufacturing glass, curing leather and making paper. Last but not least, salt is invaluable in cooking Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when used in moderation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the book contains a range of recipes for smoked and cured meat, cheeses, breads, preserved fruit and vegetables, and tasty sauces and seasonings. There is a guide to the salt content of processed foods, and an explanation of the problems that can be caused by eating too much salt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10667bb75024978a2355daef3c3e6a798a91919","amp;dn":"Practical+Household+Uses+of+Salt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10667bb75024978a2355daef3c3e6a798a91919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,6,103,187,117,2,73,120,162,53,93,174,243,195,230,167,152,169,25,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
