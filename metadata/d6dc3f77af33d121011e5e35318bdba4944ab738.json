Content is the first collection of Doctorowâ€™s infamous articles, essays, and polemics.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s why Microsoft should stop treating its customers as criminals (through relentless digital-rights management); how America chose copyright and Happy Meal toys over jobs; whyis taking a faceplant; how Wikipedia is a poor cousin of The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy; and, of course, why free e-books kick ass.\r\n\r\nPracticing what he preaches, all of the author's books, including this one, are simultaneously released in print and on the Internet under Creative Commons licenses that encourage their reuse and sharing. He argues persuasively that this practice has considerably increased his sales by enlisting readers to promote his work. Accessible to geeks and non-techies alike, this is a timely collection from an author who effortlessly surfs the zeitgeist while always generating his own wave.\r\n\r\nRead by Paul Michael Garcia\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6dc3f77af33d121011e5e35318bdba4944ab738","amp;dn":"Cory+Doctorow+-+Content","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6dc3f77af33d121011e5e35318bdba4944ab738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,220,63,119,175,51,209,33,1,30,94,53,49,139,219,164,148,74,183,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
