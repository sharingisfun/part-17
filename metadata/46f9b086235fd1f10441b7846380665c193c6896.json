According to Einstein, nothing can go faster, leaving the stars and distant galaxies almost impossibly out of our reach. But the dreams of star travelers are not dead. There could be ways to break the speed of light. Scientists around the world are challenging Einstein's speed limit and turning one of the most fundamental laws of physics upside down. By delving into the mystery of light, physicists are designing warp drives, hunting for wormholes, and discovering ways to teleport matter. The stars await and our chance to explore the final frontier might be within reach.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1936 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 29\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime per Part 43.mins\nNumber of Parts: 11\nPart Size: 641 MB\nSource: DVD\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f9b086235fd1f10441b7846380665c193c6896","amp;dn":"Discovery.Ch.Through.The.Wormhole.Season.2.08of11.Can.We.Travel.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f9b086235fd1f10441b7846380665c193c6896","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,249,176,134,35,95,209,241,4,65,183,132,99,128,102,92,25,60,104,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
