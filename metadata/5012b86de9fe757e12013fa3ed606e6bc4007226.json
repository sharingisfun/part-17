The input from both technologists developing these new methods as well as routine clinicians familiar with practical aspects and medical relevance guarantees that this practical work is a valuable asset for a wide audience, including technical personnel and decision makers in treatment centers, experts working in companies developing diagnostic devices, and clinicians specializing in advanced diagnostic methods. Since basic researchers are increasingly adopting novel diagnostic tools developed for human use as well, this will also be of interest for biomedical research institutions with large animal facilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5012b86de9fe757e12013fa3ed606e6bc4007226","amp;dn":"Ex-vivo+and+In-vivo+Optical+Molecular+Pathology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5012b86de9fe757e12013fa3ed606e6bc4007226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,18,184,109,233,254,117,126,18,1,63,163,237,96,110,107,196,0,114,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
