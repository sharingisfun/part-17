I am in the process of obtaining and sharing them all. I will also continue to collect as more soundtracks are released.\nI previously listed there being twelve, but I recently discovered they are German releases of radio plays. I don't think I'll be obtaining those in the near future...my German is nonexistent.\n\nThis album is the Original Cast Recording of &quot;Barbie Live In Fairytopia&quot;. Although Melissa Lyons, the singer of Barbie in the other musicals, is not present for this album, but her replacement did a wonderful job. The songs are delightful and heart-warming. I like how a few songs reuse melodies as they visit similar themes throughout the story. I think the movie of Fairytopia would have progressed from mediocre to fantastic if it had been a musical. Mattel really missed out on sales for that one. ;)\nSadly, I do not yet have any video for &quot;Barbie Live In Fairytopia&quot;. I did find some news about a possible DVD release. If it is in the works, I expect it to be released after the tours, so not to cut into ticket sales. :p Cross your fingers, guys!\nI've also included the lyrics that came in the booklet. It includes just a few of the songs. When I have some spare time, I'll jot down the lyrics for the rest of the songs, too.\n\nSongs From Barbie: Fairytopia\nTrack Listing:\n{Act One}\n1.
