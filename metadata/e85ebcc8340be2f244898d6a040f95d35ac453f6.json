The Ventures' Christmas Album just might be the best rock &amp; roll holiday record ever made. The instrumental twang kings deliver pretty much what you'd expect--note-for-note renditions of standards, all dressed up with ubiquitous sleigh bells as well as the requisite reverb. What really makes this disc a blast though is the way the quartet weaves 1960s pop signatures into every tune; warping &quot;Woolly Bully&quot; into &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,&quot; &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; into &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,&quot; and so on. Spin this and let your party guests have fun guessing which hit single will morph into a Christmas classic.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nTwelve Yuletide standards along the lines of &quot;White Christmas,&quot; &quot;Frosty the Snowman,&quot; and &quot;Sleigh Ride.&quot; All are arranged more or less along the lines of the classic early Ventures sound, with quotes from Ventures songs like &quot;Walk Don't Run&quot; thrown in, as well as phrases from contemporary hits like &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and &quot;When You Walk in the Room.&quot; If not for the ubiquitous overdubs of annoyingly corny sleigh bells, this would rank among the better rock &amp; roll X-mas albums. But apparently the producers couldn't resist watering down the band's trademark sleek guitar-bass-drums lineup with seasonal flavor\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e85ebcc8340be2f244898d6a040f95d35ac453f6","amp;dn":"The+Ventures+-+The+Ventures%5C%27+Christmas+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e85ebcc8340be2f244898d6a040f95d35ac453f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,94,188,200,52,11,226,242,68,137,141,106,4,15,149,211,90,196,83,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
