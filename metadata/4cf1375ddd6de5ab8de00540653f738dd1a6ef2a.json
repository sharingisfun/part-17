About 30 cool screens are available on \nthe WinCustomize site, and the program can randomly select one on every boot.\nEditing is less straightforward. \nYou build or modify logon screens by tweaking parameters on a lengthy list of\nelements. \nSo you might, for instance, change the FirstColor parameter of the Centre Panel\nelement to a new shade of blue. \nThis allows you to customize everything from background to letterings to buttons,\nbut beginners will find the process quite confusing.\n\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stardock.com/products/Logonstudio/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stardock.com/products/Logonstudio/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContains:\n\nLogon Studio for Windows XP Users [v1.01]\n&amp;\nLogon Studio for Windows Vista Users [v1.0]\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf1375ddd6de5ab8de00540653f738dd1a6ef2a","amp;dn":"Logon+Studio+%5BXp+%26+Vista+Versions%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf1375ddd6de5ab8de00540653f738dd1a6ef2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,241,55,93,221,109,229,171,141,224,5,64,101,63,115,141,209,166,239,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
