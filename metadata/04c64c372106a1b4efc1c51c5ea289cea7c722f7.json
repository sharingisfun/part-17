Her albums were loose and eclectic on the surface, yet were generally tied together by polished, professional songcraft. Crow's sunny, good-time rockers and world-weary ballads were radio staples for much of the '90s, and she was a perennial favorite at Grammy time. Although her songwriting style was firmly anchored to the rock tradition, she wasn't a slave to it -- her free-associative, reference-laden poetry could hardly have been the product of any era but the '90s. Her production not only kept pace with contemporary trends, but sometimes even pushed the envelope of what sounds could be heard on a classicist rock album, especially on her self-titled sophomore effort. All of this made Crow one of the most dependable stars of the decade, and she showed no signs of relinquishing her hard-won success in the new millennium. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n01.All I Wanna Do\n02.Soak Up The Sun\n03.My Favorite Mistake\n04.The First Cut Is The Deepest\n05.Everyday Is A Winding Road\n06.Leaving Las Vegas\n07.Strong Enough\n08.Light In Your Eyes\n09.If It Makes You Happy\n10.The Difficult Kind\n11.Picture\n12.Steve Mcqueen\n13.A Change Would Do You Good\n14.Home\n15.There Goes The Neighborhood\n16.I Shall Believe\n17.The First Cut Is The Deepest\n\n\n\n\nThanks to only1joe for his previous upload!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04c64c372106a1b4efc1c51c5ea289cea7c722f7","amp;dn":"Sheryl+Crow+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04c64c372106a1b4efc1c51c5ea289cea7c722f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,198,76,55,33,6,161,180,239,193,197,28,94,162,137,206,167,199,34,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
