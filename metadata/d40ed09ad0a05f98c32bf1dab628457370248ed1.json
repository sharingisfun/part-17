Countless readers have turned to Back to Basics for inspiration and instruction, escaping to an era before power saws and fast food restaurants and rediscovering the pleasures and challenges of a healthier, greener, and more self-sufficient lifestyle.\nNow newly updated, the hundreds of projects, step-by-step sequences, photographs, charts, and illustrations in Back to Basics will help you dye your own wool with plant pigments, graft trees, raise chickens, craft a hutch table with hand tools, and make treats such as blueberry peach jam and cheddar cheese. The truly ambitious will find instructions on how to build a log cabin or an adobe brick homestead.\n\nMore than just practical advice, this is also a book for dreamersÃ¢â‚¬â€even if you live in a city apartment you will find your imagination sparked, and there's no reason why you can't, for example, make a loom and weave a rag rug. Complete with tips for old-fashioned fun (square dancing calls, homemade toys, and kayaking tips), this may be the most thorough book on voluntary simplicity available. 2,000 color photos and 200 black-and-white illustrations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d40ed09ad0a05f98c32bf1dab628457370248ed1","amp;dn":"Back+to+Basics+A+Complete+Guide+to+Traditional+Skills+-+Abigail+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d40ed09ad0a05f98c32bf1dab628457370248ed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,14,208,154,208,160,95,152,195,43,241,218,182,40,69,115,112,36,142,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
