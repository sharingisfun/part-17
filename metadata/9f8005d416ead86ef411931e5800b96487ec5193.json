Parodies of television and radio formats were common ('Fat Man On A Bicycle', and so on). Controversial satirist Chris Morris has praised the show on many occasions, in particular for its observations on the media. Many say its influence can be felt in On The Hour and other such programmes.\n\nThere was also a show of the same name running on BBC Radio 4 in 1998, again hosted by Fry. \nThis was a completely different show, however, being a series of 45-minute serious debates interspersed with the occasional sketch or piece of music.\n\n\nCast:\nStephen Fry\nHugh Laurie\nJim Broadbent\nEmma Thompson\nPhyllida Law\nRobert Bathurst\nJulia Hills\nAlison Steadman \n\n\nSaturday Night Fry - S01 - E01\nSaturday Night Fry - S01 - E02\nSaturday Night Fry - S01 - E03\nSaturday Night Fry - S01 - E04\nSaturday Night Fry - S01 - E05\nSaturday Night Fry - S01 - E06\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s &amp; 44mn\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f8005d416ead86ef411931e5800b96487ec5193","amp;dn":"Saturday+Night+Fry+%28Stephen%29+-+S01+%26+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+%26+Chat+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f8005d416ead86ef411931e5800b96487ec5193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,128,5,212,22,234,216,110,244,17,147,30,88,0,185,100,135,236,81,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
