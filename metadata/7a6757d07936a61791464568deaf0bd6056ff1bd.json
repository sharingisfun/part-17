This release offers thoughtful solo piano (also on &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;), slow, romantic ballads (&quot;How Long Has This Been Going On,&quot; &quot;Paper Moon&quot;), and tasty mid-tempo treatments (&quot;As Time Goes By,&quot; &quot;When Your Lover Has Gone&quot;). While there are no barnburners, the heat rises to a steady simmer on &quot;You'd Be So Nice...&quot; and &quot;How High the Moon,&quot; where the players are audibly enjoying themselves. Leonhart's solos are consistently interesting, drizzled with wit, and the ever-lyrical Charlap provides rarely heard verses to six of these nine classic tunes. The CD will lease those who like their jazz served straight up and pared down to essentials; its simplicity is deceptive, given the level of expertise and feeling throughout.
