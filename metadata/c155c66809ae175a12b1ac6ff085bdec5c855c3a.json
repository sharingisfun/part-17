But, to be honest, it isn&amp;#039;t a bad album.  Certainly not one of their best, it&amp;#039;s better than Hot Streets.  It&amp;#039;s an album that builds on the past hits and gets the band back in its old groove.\n\nThat being said, it is unabashedly Disco.  Which sucks.  There are some great songs here but get ready for the bell bottoms.  And it has Donnie Dacus.  He sucks.  And like a lot of big bands in the late 70s, they added a percussion dude who danced around in the back shaking maracas.  This guy was Brazilian and had a really funky name -- Laudir de Oliveira.  The Doobies did the same thing, they had this guy with knee-high socks playing the bongos.  *Sigh* -- I miss the old days.\n\nIf you listen to this album, pay attention to the prominent role that Cetera begins to play in the band&amp;#039;s success.  I don&amp;#039;t know if Bobby was burned out, coked out, or just depressed because of Terry&amp;#039;s death but he&amp;#039;s never been the same.  Bobby Lamm is one of the great unappreciated songwriters in the world.\n\nAnother thing that doesn&amp;#039;t bode well for this album -- when one of the songwriters has a name like Dave &quot;Hawk Wolinski.  And when your drummer starts writing tunes a la Ringo Starr.  Don Henley is about the only drummer who can get away with it and when you talk about Henley you have to use the term &amp;#039;drummer&amp;#039; loosely.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nStreet Player\n\nMama Take\n\nMust Have Been Crazy\n\nWindow Dreamin&amp;#039;\n\nParadise Alley\n\nAloha Mama\n\nReruns\n\nLoser With a Broken Heart\n\nLife Is What It Is\n\nRun Away\n\nCloser to You\n\nStreet Player (Dance Mix)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c155c66809ae175a12b1ac6ff085bdec5c855c3a","amp;dn":"Chicago+XIII+%2813%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c155c66809ae175a12b1ac6ff085bdec5c855c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,85,198,104,9,174,23,90,18,177,172,111,240,133,189,236,92,133,92,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
