Arab terrorists, with the collusion of Osama bin Laden, are behind the attack, which is supposed to destroy Western civilization. A New York City law firm enlists cyber expert Jeff Aiken to track down a virus that has knocked out the company's computer network. While working on this problem, Jeff uncovers the larger threat. With the help of &quot;stunningly attractive&quot; Daryl Haugen, an old friend who becomes his love interest, Jeff attempts to warn the authorities, but to little avail. The author effectively employs the usual genre typesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½government traitors, amoral hackers, professional assassinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but his main characters spend too much time at the keyboard to build up much heat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ee447afa954758e34b0769698f974c05489b2b7","amp;dn":"Zero+Day+-+A+Novel+%282011%29+Mark+Russinovich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ee447afa954758e34b0769698f974c05489b2b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,228,71,175,169,84,117,142,52,176,118,150,152,249,116,192,84,137,178,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
