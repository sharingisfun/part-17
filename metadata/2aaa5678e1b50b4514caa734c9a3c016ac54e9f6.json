This time he tries to sing, and while he retains the electronic keyboard doodling he started out with, here he uses it as a break in the action rather than as an end in itself. \nEspecially toward the end of the disc, Adamski really lets down his guard and tries to entertain the masses. He even turns the theme from David Lynch's 1978 movie Eraserhead into the chorus for a ridiculous alphabet song. His zig-zagging synthesizer squiggles still tend to drift toward the stratosphere, and his crooning is painfully overwrought. \nBut if parts of Musical Pharmacy are indeed pretty boneheaded, at least it's the kind of boneheadedness you don't need to be high on drugs to appreciate.
