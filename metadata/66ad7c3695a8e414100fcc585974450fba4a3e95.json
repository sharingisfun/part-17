Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy.\n\nOn October 19, 2006, it was announced that The Film Crew would be providing commentary tracks for a series of B-movies. To promote their announcement, the Crew offered a poll on their website asking viewers to sample clips of each film and choose which they would prefer to see released first out of the four titles announced.\n\nThe four titles, in order of votes received (and, as a result, their release order), are Hollywood After Dark, starring Rue McClanahan (of The Golden Girls fame), Killers from Space, starring Peter Graves, The Wild Women of Wongo, The Giant of Marathon, starring Steve Reeves.\n\n\n\nTechnically, this is not a genuine Rifftrax. However, it was written and produced by former MST3K cast members Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy. When no distributor for &quot;The Film Crew&quot; DVDs were found, the cast went on to create Rifftrax.

Rifftrax is a small, independent company of 10 people who do this for a living.
