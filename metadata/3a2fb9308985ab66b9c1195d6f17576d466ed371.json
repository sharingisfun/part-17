On MOTHER, people will hear a new direction from the singer. Heavily influenced by the more rock-based, edgy and intense sound of title track, and Pink Floyd cover, Mother, Maines teamed up with friend and Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, and guitar wizard Ben Harper, who co-produced the record with Maines. The album was recorded in Harper's studio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a2fb9308985ab66b9c1195d6f17576d466ed371","amp;dn":"Natalie+Maines+-+Mother+2013+%28Scene+V0%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a2fb9308985ab66b9c1195d6f17576d466ed371","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,47,185,48,137,133,171,102,185,193,25,93,111,23,87,109,70,110,211,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
