Yet now the consensus is that he made some of the finest pop/rock recordings of his era. Sure, he had more promotional push than any other rock musician of the '50s; no, he wasn't the greatest singer; and yes, Elvis, Gene Vincent, Carl Perkins, and others rocked harder. ...\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-p109220/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nThis is a reissue of the two albums -- 1966's Bright Lights &amp; Country Music, and 1967's Country Fever -- on which Nelson plunged for the first time into country music whole hog. On Bright Lights he still used his regular band, but augmented them with Glen Campbell and future Byrd Clarence White, and regular guitarist James Burton played dobro. It wasn't country-rock, but straight country without any Nashville gloss in the production, emphasizing covers of songs by Willie Nelson, Merle Travis, Bill Anderson, and Doug Kershaw. Nelson sounded more engaged with the material than he had in years, and the album was a decent effort, but as it relied so heavily on songs that had already been made famous by others, it wasn't going to make him stand out as an innovator. Nelson acquitted himself well with his one original, &quot;You Just Can't Quit,&quot; and Campbell contributed &quot;Here I Am,&quot; yet the best cut was the fastest: &quot;Night Train to Memphis.&quot; Country Fever was similarly weighted toward interpretations of country classics. Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, and Acuff-Rose all get covered, and his sensitive reading of Willie Nelson's &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot; was a standout. There's no denying, though, that the best cut is the one that gets closest to rockabilly (a cover of &quot;Mystery Train&quot;). Nelson's two original compositions weren't much, but on the other hand there was an obscure Bob Dylan tune that the composer had not released (&quot;Walkin' Down the Line&quot;), and &quot;Things You Gave Me,&quot; with its steady beat and harmonies, sounded more like a foreshadowing of late-'60s California country-rock than anything else Nelson had recorded up to this point.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/bright-lights-country-musiccountry-fever-r365196/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/bright-lights-country-musiccountry-fever-r365196/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n======\n\nBright Lights &amp; Country Music\nAMG Review\n\nby Richie Unterberger\n\nAlthough Nelson's move into straight country music didn't result in notable commercial gains, it made sense given that his last few rock albums hadn't done much, and that most rockabilly performers had long since gone into the country market. Nelson had recorded some country material throughout his career, and this album didn't really require a radical rethink. He still used his regular band, but augmented them with Glen Campbell and future Byrd Clarence White, and regular guitarist James Burton played dobro. It wasn't country-rock, but straight country without any Nashville gloss in the production, ...\n\nRead all of the review at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/bright-lights-country-music-r45410/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/bright-lights-country-music-r45410/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n======\n\nCountry Fever\nAMG Review by Richie Unterberger\n\nCountry Fever continued the country direction of Nelson's previous album, Bright Lights &amp; Country Music, and the approach of each record was similarly weighted toward interpretations of country classics.
