Bax's rhapsodic genius and brilliant sense of orchestration eventually won him new audiences in the 1980s and 1990s. His Third Symphony was seen as a watershed work even at its premiere, a piece whose strength, confidence and craft proclaimed Bax as one of Britain's leading symphonists.\r\n\r\n\r\nBio and images included.
