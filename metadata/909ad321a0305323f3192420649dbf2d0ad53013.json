In this shocking and indelible behind-the-scenes journey, Joel Bakan, acclaimed author and award-winning maker of the renowned film and international bestselling book The Corporation, uncovers the astonishing degree to which companies exploit the special vulnerabilities of children, manipulate parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fears, and operate with callous disregard for childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health and well-being.\n\nThe number of children taking dangerous psychotropic drugs has skyrocketed as pharmaceutical companies employ insidious, often illegal tactics to inflate diagnoses of disorders and convince parents their children require medication. A highly sophisticated marketing industry deploys increasingly subtle and powerful tactics to play on childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intense emotions and desires and to lure them into obsessive consumerism. Computer game designers craft techniques to titillate children with sex and violence, while social media developers infiltrate and shape childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social and emotional worlds to compel them to spend more and more monetizable time online. AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s schools are being transformed into profit centers while children are subjected to increasingly regimented teaching that thwarts curiosity and creativity, numbing the joy of learning. And childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chronic health problems, from asthma to cancer, autism, and birth defects, steadily escalate as thousands of new industrial chemicals are dumped into their environments.
