Although it is a relatively short work, and 128 kbps is tolerable to all but hipsters.\n\n\nMany have asked, so here it is again, but please seed if you enjoy it and purchase if you are knocked out by it.  Recommended Records catalog some of the greatest music ever laid down.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f916180a475d32146cd3c3ab4353af3e813fb48","amp;dn":"%27News+From+Babel%3A+Work+Resumed+On+The+Tower%27++1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f916180a475d32146cd3c3ab4353af3e813fb48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,145,97,128,164,117,211,33,70,205,60,58,180,53,58,243,232,19,251,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
