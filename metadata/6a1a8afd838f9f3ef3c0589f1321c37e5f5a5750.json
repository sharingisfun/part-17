It received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Sound Recording for Nathan Levinson, and was named one of the 10 Best Films of 1933 by Film Daily. Warner already had a follow-up of sorts, Gold Diggers of 1933, in production before the film's release, and the success of both films permitted a higher budget and more elaborate production numbers in Warner's next follow-up, Footlight Parade.\n\nMOVIE REVIEW:- 42nd Street (1933)\nIt is 1932, during the early days of the Depression, and noted Broadway producers Jones (Robert McWade) and Barry (Ned Sparks) are putting on Pretty Lady, a musical starring Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels). Dorothy is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon (Guy Kibbee), who is the show's &quot;angel&quot; (financial backer). But while she is busy keeping Dillon both hooked and at arm's length, Dorothy is also secretly seeing her old vaudeville partner, the out-of-work Pat Denning (George Brent).\n\nJulian Marsh (Warner Baxter), who is the best, is hired to direct. His doctor warns him he risks another nervous breakdown or even his life if he continues on his high-pressure profession. Despite his long success, however, Marsh is broke as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash. He must make his last show a major hit and financial success if he is to have enough money to retire on.\n\nCast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few &quot;casting couch&quot; innuendos flying around. NaÃƒÂ¯ve newcomer Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler), who arrives in New York from her home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming (Una Merkel) and Ann &quot;Anytime Annie&quot; Lowell (Ginger Rogers), take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee (George E. Stone); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler (Dick Powell), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat.\n\nWhen Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy (Tom Kennedy) to rough him up. That plus Dorothy's realization that their situation is unhealthy makes Pat agree to break away from each other for a while; he gets a stock job in Philadelphia.\n\nRehearsals continue for five weeks to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's opening in Philadelphia, when Brock fractures her ankle. Next morning, Dillon, having quarreled with Dorothy, wants Marsh to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. Annie, however, tells Marsh that she cannot carry the show, but the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Marsh rehearses Sawyer mercilessly (vowing &quot;I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl&quot;) until an hour before the premiere.\n\nBilly finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her; she enthusiastically kisses him. Then Dorothy shows up and wishes Peggy luck, telling her that she and Pat are getting married. The show goes on. Nearly twenty minutes are devoted to three Busby Berkeley production numbers: &quot;Shuffle Off to Buffalo&quot;, &quot;Keep Young and Healthy&quot;, and &quot;42nd Street&quot;. Pretty Lady is a hit.\n\nIn the original Bradford Ropes novel, Julian Marsh and Billy Lawler are lovers. Since this sort of relationship was deemed unacceptable to audiences of the era, a romance was created for Billy and Peggy.\n\nJulian Marsh (Warner Baxter), a successful Broadway director, produces a new show, in spite of his poor health. The money comes from a rich older man, who is in love with the star of the show, Dorothy Brock. But Dorothy (Bebe Daniels) doesn't respond to his love, because she's still in love with her old partner. On the night before the premiere, Dorothy breaks her ankle, and Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler), one of the chorus girls, tries to take over Dorothy's part. \n\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4999 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 89 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 89 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a1a8afd838f9f3ef3c0589f1321c37e5f5a5750","amp;dn":"42nd+Street+%281933%29+DVD5+-+Musical+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a1a8afd838f9f3ef3c0589f1321c37e5f5a5750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,26,138,253,131,143,159,62,243,192,88,159,19,33,195,126,95,90,87,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
