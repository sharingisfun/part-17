Horowitz never attempted one. Neither did Rubinstein. Ashkenazy recorded them all, but with only partial success. Richter never managed all 32 works at one time, and Gilels died before completing his cycle. The most successful complete recordings--Schnabel, Kempff, Arrau, and Backhaus--are all by pianists with a solidly intellectual mindset, however powerful their technique. Goode joins this select company, turning in performances of uncompromising integrity and musical strength. Of course, his reputation as a musician's musician precedes him: here is a player sensitive to Beethoven's every nuance, presenting the composers thoughts with exemplary clarity and taste. This is the Beethoven cycle for the '90s. --David Hurwitz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:925a8016715e5d161bad8061f9466f93238a3d50","amp;dn":"Beethoven+complete+piano+sonatas+Richard+Goode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"925a8016715e5d161bad8061f9466f93238a3d50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,90,128,22,113,94,93,22,27,173,128,97,249,70,111,147,35,138,61,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
