By May 1945 Soviet soldiers had stormed Berlin and brought down Hitler's regime.\n\nTotal War follows the fortunes of these fighters as they liberated Russia and the Ukraine from the Nazi invader and fought their way into the heart of the Reich. It reveals the horrors they experienced - the Holocaust, genocide and the mass murder of Soviet POWs - and shows the Red Army, brutalized by war, taking its terrible revenge on the German civilian population. \n\nFor the first time Russian veterans are candid about the terrible atrocities their own army committed. But they also describe their struggle to raise themselves from the abyss of hatred. Their war against the Nazis - which in large part brought the Second World War in Europe to an end - is a tarnished but deeply moving story of sacrifice and redemption.\n\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:549c48008bea07c30477b927f7c8db8fd3564f64","amp;dn":"Total+War+From+Stalingrad+to+Berlin+by+Michael+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"549c48008bea07c30477b927f7c8db8fd3564f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,156,72,0,139,234,7,195,4,119,185,39,247,200,219,143,211,86,79,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
