The physical model also handles the particle and gas flow problems that arise from coal gasification and fluidized beds. The second part of this book deals with the computational methods for particle transport.\nReadership: Undergraduate and graduate students studying mechanical engineering; professionals dealing with fluid mechanics, nuclear physics, and plasma physics in their day-to-day encounters -- particularly the use of two-phase flows, and particle transport","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:295f5f36b227a18352f415aeaaa280f446eebb28","amp;dn":"Computational+Methods+for+Two-Phase+Flow+and+Particle+Transport","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"295f5f36b227a18352f415aeaaa280f446eebb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,95,95,54,178,39,161,131,82,244,21,174,170,162,128,244,70,238,187,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
