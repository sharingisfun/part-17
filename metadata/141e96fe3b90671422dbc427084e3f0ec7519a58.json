It started in Compton.  It ended in family.\n\n\tDeath Row Records exploded on the music scene in 1993 with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gangster RapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sound that took the world by storm.

Marion Ã¢â‚¬Å“SugeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unconventional business practices increasingly mirrored the violent, hard-edged themes of its music.\n\nTold entirely in the words of those who were there, Welcome to Death Row is the complete and largely untold story of this enigmatic enterprise.
