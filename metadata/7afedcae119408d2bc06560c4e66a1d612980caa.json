I uploaded the title track earlier this year, so I want to clarify that this torrent contains French duo Justice's entire highly-anticipated second LP, Audio, Video, Disco, their follow-up to 2007 debut album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â . It contains previously released tracks &quot;Civilization,&quot; &quot;Helix,&quot; &quot;Canon,&quot; &quot;Newlands,&quot; and the aforementioned title track. Seed and enjoy!\n\n1. Horsepower (3:39)\n2. Civilization (4:11)\n3. Ohio (4:01)\n4. Canon (Primo) (0:27)\n5. Canon (3:39)\n6. On 'n' On (4:30)\n7. Brianvision (3:11)\n8. Parade (4:01)\n9. Newlands (4:14)\n10. Helix (4:31)\n11. Audio, Video, Disco\n\nNOTE: There's a small audio dip towards the end of the eighth track, &quot;Parade.&quot; I'm assuming this is an audio error. It's not a big deal and I don't know if there are any corrected versions of that track available, but I thought I'd let you know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afedcae119408d2bc06560c4e66a1d612980caa","amp;dn":"Justice+-+Audio%2C+Video%2C+Disco+%5BFULL+ALBUM%5D+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afedcae119408d2bc06560c4e66a1d612980caa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,254,220,174,17,148,8,210,188,6,86,12,78,102,161,214,18,152,12,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
