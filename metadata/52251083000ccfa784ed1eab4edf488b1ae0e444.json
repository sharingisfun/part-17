The project originated when Atlantic Records president Ahmet ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n wanted to record an album of his favourite songs from the 1950s. Plant was chosen because ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n had seen his pick-up band the Honeydrippers performing 1950s standards. Included in the band were Chic front man Nile Rodgers, and former Yardbirds guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy PageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the latter was Plant's former band mate in Led Zeppelin. &quot;Sea of Love&quot; became Plant's biggest-selling single.\n\nAccording to various Led Zeppelin biographies[who?], the success of &quot;Sea of Love&quot; was a blow to Plant's ego, as the song was initially the B-side of the proper single &quot;Rockin' at Midnight,&quot; but radio stations flipped the single and played &quot;Sea of Love&quot; much more than the original A-side. Plant has stated in various interviews[citation needed] that the blow he perceived to his own ego as a result, was the reason that nothing more was ever done with the Honeydrippers as he was terribly afraid he'd be regarded as nothing but a crooner from that point onward. When asked about the Honeydrippers, Plant would simply say, &quot;They're asleep.&quot;[citation needed]\n\nThe album was re-released in a remastered edition in 2007 as part of a Robert Plant remaster series. Plant and ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n discussed the possibility of doing a new Honeydrippers album, but with the latterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death December 2006, the plan was shelved permanently.\n\nTrack listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. &quot;I Get a Thrill&quot;   \n2. &quot;Sea of Love&quot;   \n3. &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;    \n4. &quot;Young Boy Blues&quot;   \n5. &quot;Rockin' at Midnight&quot;  \n\nBONUS TRACK\n\n6. &quot;Rockin' at Midnight&quot; [LIVE] \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Honeydrippers was a rock band of the 1980s. Former Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert Plant formed the group in 1981 to satisfy his long-time goal in having a rock band with a heavy R&amp;B basis. Formed originally in Worcestershire, Plant went on to record an EP in the US. In addition to Plant, the band was composed of fellow former Led Zeppelin member guitarist Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck (a former Yardbirds member like Page) and other friends and well-known studio musicians. They performed in a concert at Keele University in 1981. It released only one EP on 12 November 1984, titled The Honeydrippers: Volume One.\n\nThe Honeydrippers peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 with a remake of the Phil Phillips' tune &quot;Sea of Love&quot; and hit the top 30 with &quot;Rockin' at Midnight,&quot; which was originally the B-side to &quot;Sea of Love.&quot; With the EP's success, Plant stated that a full album would be recorded, but it never was. The band appeared on Saturday Night Live on December 15, 1984, performing &quot;Rockin' at Midnight&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus is Back in Town.&quot; The band featured Brian Setzer on guitar and Paul Shaffer on piano.\n\nOn 23 December 2006, Robert Plant performed a charity show at Kidderminster Town Hall under the title The Return of the Honeydrippers to raise money for his neighbor Jackie Jennings, who was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor.[1]\n\nAfter Plant's appearance at the 2006 Montreux Jazz Festival to honor Ahmet ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n, the two discussed a new Honeydrippers album for 2007.[citation needed] After ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n's death, Plant has said that this is now unlikely.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMembers:\n\nRobert Plant - vocals \nJimmy Page - guitars \nJeff Beck - guitars \nRobbie Blunt - guitar \nBrian Setzer - guitar \nAndy Silvester - guitar \nWayne Terry - bass \nJim Hickman - bass \nKevin O'Neill - drums \nRicky Cool - harmonica \nKeith Evans - saxophone \nPaul Shaffer - keyboard \nNile Rodgers \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52251083000ccfa784ed1eab4edf488b1ae0e444","amp;dn":"Honeydrippers+-+%5C%27VOL.1+-+%5BBONUS+TRACK%5D%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52251083000ccfa784ed1eab4edf488b1ae0e444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,37,16,131,0,12,207,167,132,237,30,171,78,223,72,139,26,224,228,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
