Starting with the 1947 Floyd Jones (the classic &quot;Stockyard Blues&quot;) and Johnny Young sessions for Old Swingmaster with Snooky in support and running right from the early '50s into the early-'60s sides for the JOB label with &quot;Boogie Twist&quot; (his Vee-Jay and Parrot sides are not here), this is ground floor Chicago blues one step removed from Maxwell Street. Lots of unissued sides-all of them great-plus the inclusion of the instrumental &quot;Boogie,&quot; which became the blueprint for Little Walter's hit &quot;Juke.&quot; Pryor's finest moments on wax. ~Review by Cub Koda\n\nTracklist\n01.
