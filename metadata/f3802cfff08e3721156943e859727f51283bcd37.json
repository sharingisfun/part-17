Despite this, a few FL9s are still in occasional revenue-generating service, whilst some have been preserved in museum collections. \n\nThe EMD FL9 for Train Simulator is available in New Haven Ã¢â‚¬ËœMcGinnisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heritage livery, as operated by the Connecticut Department of Transport in the 2000s. Features of the model including in-cab signalling as seen on the New York-New Haven line. Also included are Metro-North Shoreliner III passenger cars with passenger view, and driveable cab car","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3802cfff08e3721156943e859727f51283bcd37","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015++New+Haven+FL9+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3802cfff08e3721156943e859727f51283bcd37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,128,44,255,240,142,55,33,21,105,67,232,89,114,127,81,40,59,205,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
