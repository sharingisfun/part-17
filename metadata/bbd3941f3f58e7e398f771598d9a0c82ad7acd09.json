The 1st CD Pressings - Japan 1987.\n\nThe New York Dolls created punk rock before there was a term for it. Building on the Rolling Stones' dirty rock &amp; roll, Mick Jagger's androgyny, girl group pop, the glam rock of David Bowie and T. Rex, and the Stooges' anarchic noise, the New York Dolls created a new form of hard rock that presaged both punk rock and heavy metal. Their drug-fueled, shambolic performances influenced a generation of musicians in New York and London, who all went on to form punk bands. And although they self-destructed quickly, the band's two albums remain two of the most popular cult records in Rock &amp; Roll history.\n\nOriginally Released: 1973/1974\nThis CD Released: January 15, 1988\nLabel: Nippon Phonogram Co. Ltd.\nCatalog No.: 33PD-422\n\nThanks to the original uploader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbd3941f3f58e7e398f771598d9a0c82ad7acd09","amp;dn":"New+York+Dolls+-+Self-titled+%26amp%3B+Too+Much+Too+Soon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbd3941f3f58e7e398f771598d9a0c82ad7acd09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,211,148,31,63,88,231,227,152,247,113,89,141,154,12,130,173,122,205,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
