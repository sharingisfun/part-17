They are attacked by masses of zombies, and those bitten become zombies as well. The Lanes narrowly escape and flee to an apartment complex to be extracted by a helicopter sent by Gerry's former UN colleague, Thierry. The family reaches the helicopter and are taken to a US Navy ship off the coast of New York, where a team of analysts and military personnel are analyzing the scope of the worldwide outbreak. A virologist, Dr. Fassbach, argues that the plague is a virus, whose origin must be found in order for a vaccine to be developed. The naval commander tells Gerry that, because of his expertise as a former UN investigator, he is to investigate the virus and help Fassbach find the source of the outbreak. Reluctantly agreeing for the sake of his family's staying on the ship, Gerry leaves on a plane for the military base in South Korea.\n\nArriving at the Camp Humphreys at Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi-do in South Korea, where the word &quot;zombie&quot; was supposedly first used in reference to the outbreak, they are attacked and Fassbach accidentally kills himself. At the base, Gerry learns from the commander that the zombies are attracted to noise. The commander also informs Gerry of a local who was found foaming at the mouth that bit a doctor and shows him to a room of incinerated bodies, where they, the soldiers, first saw the outbreak. An imprisoned CIA traitor tells Gerry to go to Jerusalem, where leader Jurgen Warmbrunn has established a safe zone just before the outbreak was officially acknowledged, implying Israel might have had prior knowledge.\n\nHeading to Jerusalem, Gerry meets Warmbrunn, who explained that Israel's intelligence service, Mossad had months earlier intercepted communications from army general in India, which stated that Indian troops were fighting the &quot;undead&quot;. With this knowledge and using a program implemented to prevent Israel being caught off guard, as in past conflicts, a quarantine is established, and they are letting uninfected civilians in. Due to loud noises coming from within the zone however, thousands of infected on the other side of the wall begin piling onto each other and climb over. Chaos erupts, and Gerry's escort soldier, Segen, is bitten. Gerry immediately cuts off her hand to prevent her from turning and they escape on a plane as Jerusalem falls to the infected.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab68fb41d597a6c3979c03628db395481edc4c3","amp;dn":"World+War+Z+TSCam.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab68fb41d597a6c3979c03628db395481edc4c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,182,143,180,29,89,122,108,57,121,192,54,40,219,57,84,129,237,196,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
