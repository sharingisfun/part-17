The story is set in the Town of &quot;St. Petersburg&quot;, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Mark Twain lived.\n\n In the 1840s an imaginative and mischievous boy named Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother, Sid, in the Mississippi River town of st. Petersburg, Missouri. After playing hooky from school on Friday and dirtying his clothes in a fight, Tom is made to whitewash the fence as punishment all of the next day. At first, Tom is disheartened by having to forfeit his day off. However, he soon cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work. He trades the treasures he got by tricking his friends for whitewashing for tickets given out in Sunday school for memorizing Bible verses, which can be used to claim a Bible as a prize. He received enough tickets to be given the Bible. However, he loses much of his glory when, in response to a question to show off his knowledge, he incorrectly answers that the first disciples were David and Goliath.\n\n Thank you Author for Amazing BOOK","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba9e15abc2ffe2fe0683c8aec2947d8604b57e63","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Tom+Sawyer-+Mark+Twain.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba9e15abc2ffe2fe0683c8aec2947d8604b57e63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,158,21,171,194,255,226,254,6,131,200,174,194,148,125,134,4,181,126,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
