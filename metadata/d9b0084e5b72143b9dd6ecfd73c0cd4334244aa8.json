Regardless, the latter dates are the closest thing to an\n   official chronology I could uncover, and are thus used for ordering purposes here.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b0084e5b72143b9dd6ecfd73c0cd4334244aa8","amp;dn":"Magenta+Collection+%28300%2B+pages%29+%28Eurotica%2B%26hellip%3B%29+%282002-%26gt%3B%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b0084e5b72143b9dd6ecfd73c0cd4334244aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,176,8,78,91,114,20,59,157,214,236,253,115,192,205,67,52,36,74,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
