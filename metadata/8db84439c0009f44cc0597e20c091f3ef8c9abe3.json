The New York Times played a crucial role in breaking the WikiLeaks story, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOpen SecretsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the definitive chronicle of the documentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ release and the controversy that ensued. It includes detailed analyses of the documents by Times correspondents; opinion essays by Frank Rich, Maureen Dowd and others; and the full text of all the cables and war logs posted on The Times's Web site, along with 27 new cables selected for this volume. It also includes an essay in which the executive editor of The Times, Bill Keller, explains how the newspaper came to publish documents obtained by WikiLeaks, and why it did; expanded profiles of Julian Assange, WikiLeaks's founder, and Bradley Manning, the Army private suspected of being his source; and original essays on what the fracas has revealed about American diplomacy and government secrecy. A legal and technological thriller and a primer on world politics, &quot;Open Secrets&quot; is also a field guide to how information and power are wielded today, and why it matters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8db84439c0009f44cc0597e20c091f3ef8c9abe3","amp;dn":"Open+Secrets+WikiLeaks%2C+War+and+American+Diplomacy+-+NYT+%5BEBOOK+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8db84439c0009f44cc0597e20c091f3ef8c9abe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,184,68,57,192,0,159,68,204,5,151,226,12,9,31,62,248,201,171,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
