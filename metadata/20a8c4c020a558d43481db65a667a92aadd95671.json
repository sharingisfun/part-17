There are actors making strange assertions and then short clips of these famous men commenting out of context. The film tells the tale of how Stanley Kubrik was involved in a vast government conspiracy regarding the moon landings. It is quite entertaining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20a8c4c020a558d43481db65a667a92aadd95671","amp;dn":"Dark+Side+of+the+Moon+%28William+Karel+mockumentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20a8c4c020a558d43481db65a667a92aadd95671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,168,196,192,32,165,88,212,52,129,219,101,166,103,169,42,173,217,86,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
