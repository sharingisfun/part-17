The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.\n\nIn this pack, Cosmic Gate. There from the start, still going strong. If you think back to all the anthems you have heard, these guys are in there probably more than once. With amazing singles like Firewire, Exploration of Space, Back to Earth and more that have never really truly left the playlists around the world. This pack contains over 12 hours!\n\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Club Noxx Belgium 20101022.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Defqon One 20040619.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Einslive Lubeck 20020825.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Ice Palace Miami 20110325.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Kontor 20021123.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Orgasmatron 20020413.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Rosenmontags 20010226.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ RPR Maximal 20020201.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Sputnik Maximal 20030407.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Trance Energy 20020216.mp3\nCosmic Gate - Live @ Trance Energy 20030215.mp3\n\nI have avoided sets that are too new or likely easy to find and stuck to ones that I think should hang around for many years to come!\n\nThese are all amazing, but Orgasmatron in Italy, Rosenmontags Germany and Kontor really stand out in my mind as sets that I couldn't stop listening to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b04ad147ad37cce78cd0d0afeca44eb4e287de","amp;dn":"Gods+Collection+-+Cosmic+Gate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b04ad147ad37cce78cd0d0afeca44eb4e287de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,176,74,209,71,173,55,204,231,140,208,208,175,236,164,78,180,226,135,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
