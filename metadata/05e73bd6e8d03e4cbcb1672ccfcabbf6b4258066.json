She is best known for her comic book series, The Further Fattening Adventures of Pudge, Girl Blimp, which lasted from 1973 to 1978.\n\nMarrs was a frequent contributor to underground comics and one of the 'founding mommies' of the Wimmen's Comix collective. She provided stories for Wet Satin, Manhunt, El Perfecto, and Gates of Eden. Her parodies often substituted lesbians in place of heterosexual figures, as in feature strips in the long-running Gay Comix.\n\nAs one of Mike Friedrich's Star Reach regulars, she expanded her writing and art style to include serious fantasy fiction in Stark's Quest (1977-79), a study of ESP, politics, and social engineering. From this body of work, 'Waters of Requital' (1977) is especially powerful. She created short futuristic graphic tales for Heavy Metal magazine, Epic Illustrated and Imagine magazine.\n\n\nEl Perfecto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7636144/El_Perfecto_%28Underground_-_Restored%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7636144/El_Perfecto_%28Underground_-_Restored%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGates of Eden &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7670672/Gates_of_Eden_(Underground_-_Restored)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7670672/Gates_of_Eden_(Underground_-_Restored)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nManhunt is my next upload.\n\nI'm working on finding Wet Satin (I have neither of them) and putting together complete runs of Star Reach and Wimmen's Comix. If anybody can help with that, please drop me a not at the SuprBay. (I have Star Reach 1-9 and all of the Star Reach Classics, I only have issues 10, 15 and the collected edition of Wommen's Comix). \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e73bd6e8d03e4cbcb1672ccfcabbf6b4258066","amp;dn":"Lee+Marrs+Comix+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e73bd6e8d03e4cbcb1672ccfcabbf6b4258066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,231,59,214,232,208,62,76,188,177,103,44,207,202,187,246,180,37,128,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
