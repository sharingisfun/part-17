Page flubs twice during the last part of Black \r\nDog, repeating the bum note to make it seem intentional after the first mistake, then bursting with another flurry of notes, as he attempts the end the song a second time. No Quarter is a really nice version here and Jonesy is in peak form tonight playing some really interesting jazzy notes. Plant introduces Bonzo as something the people in China and Korea are never gonna see; something the people in Russia will never get a chance to look at; a gentleman â€œfull of shit and speedâ€. Unfortunately, Jimmyâ€™s guitar goes mute, leaving Jonsey and Bonzo alone. After some fun during Heartbreaker, as the boys chase each other around, perhaps the highlight of this set follows. After the theremin madness, Jones launches into a bit of The Crunge, but itâ€™s ignored by Page. Plant then sings a bit of Honey Bee, answered by a flurry of buzzing notes from Page, circa 1970! After that brief interlude, and a tease of â€œone nightâ€¦.â€ from Plant, Page answers with notes from Going Down. Plant and company pick up on this and the band launches into a full version of the song, complete with solo, a real rarity during the more static shows of the 1973 US Tour. A rousing version of â€œThe Oceanâ€ closes out the show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f091c33f10e3cb482d16de7c8857f1894fd657ce","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.05.28+San+Diego%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f091c33f10e3cb482d16de7c8857f1894fd657ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,145,195,63,16,227,203,72,45,22,222,124,136,87,241,137,79,214,87,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
