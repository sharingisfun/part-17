He is most famous for the novel Ãƒâ‚¬ rebours (Against Nature). His style is remarkable for its idiosyncratic use of the French language, wide-ranging vocabulary, wealth of detailed and sensuous description, and biting, satirical wit. \n\nThe novels are also noteworthy for their encyclopaedic documentation, ranging from the catalogue of decadent Latin authors in Ãƒâ‚¬ rebours to the discussion of the symbology of Christian architecture in La cathÃƒÂ©drale. Huysmans' work expresses a disgust with modern life and a deep pessimism, which led the author first to the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer then to the teachings of the Catholic Church.\n\nGenre: Fiction, European Literature, 19th century\n\n\nAgainst Nature (A Rebours):\n\nWith a title either translated either as Against Nature or as Against The Grain, this wildly original fin-de-siÃƒÂ¨cle novel follows its sole character, Des Esseintes, a decadent, ailing aristocrat who retreats to an isolated villa where he indulges his taste for luxury and excess. \n\nVeering between nervous excitability and debilitating ennui, he gluts his aesthetic appetites with classical literature and art, exotic jewels (with which he fatally encrusts the shell of his tortoise), rich perfumes, and a kaleidoscope of sensual experiences. The original handbook of decadence, Against Nature exploded like a grenade (in the words of its author) and has enjoyed a cult readership from its publication to the present day.\n\nThe Damned (La-Bas):\n\nAt the novel's center is Durtal, a writer obsessed with the life of one of the blackest figures in history, Gilles de Rais -- child murderer, sadist, necrophile, and practitioner of all the black arts. The book's authentic, extraordinarily detailed descriptions of the Black Mass have never been surpassed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b20832955dcbe8bf4007fbab9aa2c9dfe1bb736d","amp;dn":"Two+Novels+by+Joris-Karl+Huysmans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b20832955dcbe8bf4007fbab9aa2c9dfe1bb736d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,8,50,149,93,203,232,191,64,7,251,171,154,162,201,223,225,187,115,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
