Hall's fifth album (from 1971), and The Rhymer and Other Five and Dimers (from 1973), his seventh, are combined onto one CD on this British reissue. While the pairing of two LPs that weren't consecutive might be a little disconcerting to some collectors, at least both of these records counted among Hall's stronger titles, and were released fairly close to each other, if not exactly next to each other. In Search of a Song is the stronger of the two, containing an abundance of the wry, sly, storytelling songs for which Hall's most famous (or at least most critically respected). &quot;The Year That Clayton Delaney Died,&quot; a number-one country single, is the most famous of its tunes. But some of the others actually pack a sharper wit, like &quot;L.A. Blues,&quot; which puts down city life with far more agreeable disgust than most of the numerous country tunes which take that theme as its subject, and the memorable character of &quot;The Little Lady Preacher.&quot; In comparison, The Rhymer and Other Five and Dimers doesn't have nearly as much of an edge, though it boasted a couple hits in &quot;Ravishing Ruby&quot; and &quot;Spokane Motel Blues.&quot; Its songwriting and production veer closer to mainstream country sentimentality, with some deviations from Hall's usual approach via a cover of Billy Joe Shaver's &quot;Old Five and Dimers Like Me&quot; and a couple of duets with Patti Page.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2311e204f2671add7c50c476b459e3b20df4fb0a","amp;dn":"Tom+T.+Hall+-+In+Search+Of+A+Song+%2F+The+Rhymer+And+Other+Five+An","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2311e204f2671add7c50c476b459e3b20df4fb0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,17,226,4,242,103,26,221,124,80,196,118,180,89,227,178,13,244,251,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
