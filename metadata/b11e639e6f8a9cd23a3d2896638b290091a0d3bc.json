They are hard to follow, very ugly, and not print friendly. I organized the calendar in 9 rows of 10, which keeps track of the 90 day progress quite well. Included are two calendars: a 2-step and a 3-step program.\n\nThe 2-step program is for those who want to use only the first two DVDs in the Power 90 series. This includes Sculpt 1-2 and 3-4 and Sweat/Abs 1-2 and 3-4. Each step is plotted for 45 days.\n\nThe 3-step program is for those who want to use the Master Series in addition to the standard 2 DVDs. This includes Sculpt 5-6 and Sweat 5-6. (Note: the Master Series does not include an Ab Ripper, so use Ab Ripper 3-4 to complement Sweat 5-6.) Each step is plotted for 30 days.\n\nCamera icons signify when pictures are to be taken of your body to track progress. Dates have been left out and aren't really needed as long as you stay on top of the program. There is space to the left of the day number in case you do need to write the dates down. There is plenty of space in the middle of each day for an &quot;X&quot; to mark completion of that day's workout.\n\nHopefully this makes it easier to keep track of your training!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11e639e6f8a9cd23a3d2896638b290091a0d3bc","amp;dn":"Power+90+P90+90-day+Calendar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11e639e6f8a9cd23a3d2896638b290091a0d3bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,30,99,158,111,138,156,210,58,61,40,150,99,139,41,0,145,160,211,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
