The best of the five Earl's Court gigs, this show \r\nhas the band reaching a peak for 1975, one that is even better than Seattle and \r\nLA two months earlier. Nicky Horne simply introduced the band: &quot;Welcome to Earl's Court. For the next three hours ... your mother wouldn't like it!&quot; No Quarter must be the best version ever recorded, and Dazed And Confused is an incredible journey. Dennis Healey was again remembered during the introduction to the Dazed: &quot;We gotta fly soon. Y'know how it goes with Dennis ... dear Dennis. Private enterprise ... no artists in the country anymore ... he must be dazed and confused!&quot; Stairway To Heaven contains probably the best solo ever by Jimmy on the song while Plant's vocal is not the best. The humour was belonged to the whole group so Bonham took the microphone as they climbed for the encores and said: &quot;I'd like to say at this point that I think football's a load of bollocks!&quot; what caued a quick retort from Plant: &quot;I'd like to say that soccer's a wonderful sport, the best sport.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:981ae1cb05c4e2e080ed015f35b17ed3ae3d50e3","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.05.24+Earl%27s+Court%2C+London+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"981ae1cb05c4e2e080ed015f35b17ed3ae3d50e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,26,225,203,5,196,226,224,128,237,1,95,53,177,126,211,174,61,80,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
