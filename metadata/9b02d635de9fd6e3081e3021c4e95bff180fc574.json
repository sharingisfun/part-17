Alan Ladd was cast as Raven in the film, but the character&amp;#039;s description in the book suggests someone quite different.\n\nRaven is a man dedicated to ugly deeds. When Raven is paid for killing the Minister of War with stolen notes, he becomes a man on the run. Tracking down the agent who double-crossed him, and eluding the police simultaneously, he becomes both the hunter and the hunted.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b02d635de9fd6e3081e3021c4e95bff180fc574","amp;dn":"Graham+Greene+-+This+Gun+for+Hire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b02d635de9fd6e3081e3021c4e95bff180fc574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,2,214,53,222,159,214,227,8,30,48,33,196,233,91,255,24,15,197,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
