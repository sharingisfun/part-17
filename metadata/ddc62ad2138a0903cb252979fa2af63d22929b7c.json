They subsequently dropped out of their studies to further concentrate on the band that would ultimately become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together along with James LaBrie and Jordan Rudess until September 8, 2010 when Portnoy left the band. In October 2010, the band held auditions for Portnoy's replacement drummer. Mike Mangini was announced as the new permanent drummer on April 29, 2011.\nThe band is well known for the technical proficiency of its instrumentalists, who have won many awards from music instruction magazines. Guitarist John Petrucci has been named as the third player on the G3 tour six times, more than any invited players. In 2009 he was named the No. 2 best metal guitarist by Joel McIver in his book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists. He was also named as one of the &quot;Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time&quot; by GuitarOne magazine. Former drummer Mike Portnoy has won 23 awards from Modern Drummer magazine and is also the second youngest person (at the age of 37) to be inducted into the Rock Drummer Hall of Fame. His replacement Mike Mangini has also previously set 5 WFD records. John Myung was voted the greatest bassist of all time in a poll conducted by MusicRadar in August through September 2010. The band was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2010.\nThe band's highest-selling album is the gold-selling Images and Words (1992), which reached #61 on the Billboard 200 chart. Both the 1994 release Awake and their 2002 release Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also entered the charts at #32 and #46 respectively and received mostly positive reviews. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence also led to Dream Theater becoming the initial band reviewed in the music section of Entertainment Weekly during its opening week of release, despite the magazine generally preferring more mainstream music. In 2007, Systematic Chaos entered U.S. Billboard 200 at #19. By 2008, Dream Theater had sold over 2.1 million albums in the U.S. and over 10 million records worldwide.\n\n.:Dream Theater:.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3947/dreamw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3947/dreamw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe albums\nMp3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CBR 320 kbps\n\nMajesty (pre Dream Theater)\n1986-No Sleep Since Brooklyn - Instru Mental III @320\n1987-Instru Mental @320\n1992-Instru Mental II @320\n1995-When Dream and Today Unite\n\nStudio albums\n1989 When Dream And Day Unite(Remaster) @320\n1992 Images And Words @320\n1994 Awake @320\n1997 Falling Into Infinity @320\n1999 Metropolis Pt. 2 - Scenes From A Memory @320\n2002 Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence (2 CD) @320\n2003 Train of Thought @320\n2005 Octavarium @320\n2007 Systematic Chaos (with Bonus DVD rip Documentary) @320\n2009 Black Clouds And Silver Linings (3 CD) @320\n\nEP\n1995 A Change of Seasons @320\n2009 Wither @320\n\nCompilation albums\n2008 Dream Theater's Greatest Hit (... &amp; 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs) @320\n\nLive albums\n1993 Live At The Marquee @320\n1998 Once In A LIVEtime (2 CD) @320\n2001 Live Scenes From New York (3 CD) @320\n2004 Live at Budokan (3 CD) @320\n2006 Score-The 20th Anniversary Tour (3 CD) @320\n2008 Chaos in Motion 2007-2008 (3 CD) @320\n\nSingles (some)\n1994 Lie (Promo_Single) @320\n1994 Lie @320\n1994 The Silent Man @320\n1995 A Change Of Seasons @320\n1996 Hollow Years @320\n2000 Through Her Eyes @320\n2003 As I Am (Promo Single) @320\n2007 Constant Motion (Promo) @320\n2009 A Rite Of Passage (CD-Single) @320\n\nOfficial bootlegs - Cover Series\n2002 Master of Puppets (Metallica) @320\n2005 The Number of the Beast (Iron Maiden) @320\n2006 The Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) (2 CD) @320\nCD1 Dark Side Of The Moon\nCD2 Bonus Disc - A Saucerful of Floyd\n2007 Made in Japan (Deep Purple) @320\n2009-Uncovered 2003-2005 @320\n\nOfficial bootlegs - Demo Series\n2003 Majesty Demos 1985-1986 @320 @320\n2004 When Dream And Day Unite Demos 1987-1989 (2 CD) @320\n2005 Images And Words Demos 1989-1991 (2 CD) @320\n2006 Awake Demos 1994 @320\n2007 Falling Into Infinity Demos 1996-1997 (2 CD) @320\n2009 Train Of Thought Instrumental Demos 2003 @320\n\nOfficial bootlegs - Studio Series\n2003-The Making Of Scenes From A Memory (2 CD) @320\n2009-The Making Of Falling Into Infinity @320\n\nOfficial bootlegs - Live Series\n2003-Los Angeles, California 5-18-98 (2 CD) @320\n2004-Tokyo, Japan 10-28-95 (2 CD) @320\n2005-When Dream And Day Reunite @320\n2006-Old Bridge, New Jersey 12-14-96 (2 CD) @320\n2007-New York City 3-4-93 (2 CD)\n\nOther albums\n1996-Christmas CD @320\n1996-Guitar Talkin' @320\n1996-Uncovered (2 CD) @320\n1998-Once In A Livetime Outtakes @320\n1998-Trial Of Singles @320\n1999-Cleaning Out The Closet (plus Bonus video) @320\n2000-Scenes From A World Tour (plus Bonus video) @320\n2001 Four Degrees Of Radio Edits @320\n2002-Taste The Memories @320\n2002-The Atco Demos @320\n2003-Graspop Festival 2002 @320\n2003-Stream Of Consciousness @320\n2004 A Sort Of Homecoming @320\n2004 The Covers 2 @320\n2007-Images And Words 15th Anniversary Performance @320\n2007-Lifting Shadow (Companion CD) @320\n2009-Progressive Nation 2008 @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc62ad2138a0903cb252979fa2af63d22929b7c","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+Discography+1986-2009+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc62ad2138a0903cb252979fa2af63d22929b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,198,42,210,19,138,9,3,203,37,41,121,250,42,246,61,34,146,155,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
