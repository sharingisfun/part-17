Along with designers, engineers, and builders, he'll find the most dangerous, most spectacular, most difficult, and most inventively executed aspects of the job.   \n\nDanny arrives at the planet's most humongous project: the Sakhalin oil and gas complex now under construction on a remote Russian island. The Russians are pouring billions into this city-sized operation, which is designed to suck fossil fuel from a frigid corner of the Pacific. Danny puts on his work boots and actually gets to bolt down a huge gas tank suspended from a crane. He also pays a visit to a crane operator more than 1,000 feet up in the air. \n\nFile Size ------- 347mb\nLength ---------- 43:08\nResolution ------ 720x432\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by thehashden.com\n\n&lt;&lt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aabd2fa0cdaeb0c0892594bb42c40d48bef65c78","amp;dn":"Science+Channel%3A+Build+it+Bigger+-+Sakhalin+Oil+and+Ice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aabd2fa0cdaeb0c0892594bb42c40d48bef65c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,189,47,160,205,174,176,192,137,37,148,187,66,196,13,72,190,246,92,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
