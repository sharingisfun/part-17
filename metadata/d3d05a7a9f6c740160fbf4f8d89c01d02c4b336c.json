How right he was. Another Blood and Fire release, so it comes with nuff Liner Notes by Steve Barrow, and Artwork. This album is a collection of Tappa Zukies (David Sinclair, July 2, 1955) dubs, mixed by Philip Smart. It's one of the best DUB albums I've heard, and certainly some tracks, like MPLA, I consider to be in my all time top ten. On several tracks the mixing takes over the original sound so much, that a true mystic vibe enters. No smooth, polished versions, but hardcore dub coming from the ghetto's of Kingston Jamaica.\n It is a mix of the best quality reggae musicians that play on this album. In his notes, Steve Barrow writes &quot;First issued when dub was still relatively fresh, and long unavailable, 'Tappa Zukie In Dub' proves a fitting cornerstone to the producer's career, so just string up and stand back, and let King Tappa rock the musical atmosphere!&quot;.\n\n\n Tracklist:\n 1.
