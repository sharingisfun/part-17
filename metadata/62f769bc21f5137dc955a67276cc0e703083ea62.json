Light, soulful, and jazzy, Moondance opens with the sweetly nostalgic &quot;And It Stoned Me,&quot; the song's pastoral imagery establishing the dominant lyrical motif recurring throughout the album -- virtually every track exults in natural wonder, whether it's the nocturnal magic celebrated by the title cut or the unlimited promise offered in &quot;Brand New Day.&quot; At the heart of the record is &quot;Caravan,&quot; an incantatory ode to the power of radio; equally stirring is the majestic &quot;Into the Mystic,&quot; a song of such elemental beauty and grace as to stand as arguably the quintessential Morrison moment. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://farm3.staticflickr.com/2592/3958138428_9ecb49c834.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://farm3.staticflickr.com/2592/3958138428_9ecb49c834.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1.
