He realized then... he'd hit on something. Ask almost anyone and you'll hear, &quot;Communism is dead! The Berlin Wall came down.&quot; Thought the word communism isn't used anymore, this film will show the ideas behind it are alive and well. Join Bowers for a fascinating look at the people and groups that have successfully targeted America's morality and freedom in their effort to grind America down. It's a well documented AGENDA.
