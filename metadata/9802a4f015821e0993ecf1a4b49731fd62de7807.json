He exuded charisma, raw talent, and creativity to excess - delivering some of the most revolutionary music of the 20th century.\n\nA self-taught left-handed guitarist, Jimi played with a right handed Fender Stratocaster - upside down and re-strung. His use of the Strat's tremelo bar was one of the signature elements of his blues influenced style of rock music. In addition to his songwriting and playing ability, Jimi Hendrix was also a pioneer in using the recording studio as an &quot;instrument&quot;.\n\nBorn in Seattle, Washington in 1942, Jimi Hendrix did not initially find success in his home country. He left for England in September 1966, invited there by The Animal's bass player Chas Chandler. Chas saw Jimi play at The Wha? in Greenich Village and convinced him to go to London, where the audience might be more receptive to his style.\n\nAfter just a few weeks, &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Experience&quot; trio was founded with Noel Redding on bass and John &quot;Mitch&quot; Mitchell playing drums. In the months that followed they played a string on club venues and released their first UK single - &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. The blistering &quot;Purple Haze&quot; came next, and eventually the debut album - &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; was released to rapidly growing fanbase.\n\nIn 1967 his popularity was rising, and Jimi returned to America to play at the Monterey Pop Festival. He delivered a legendary set that he ended by setting fire to his guitar - one of the defining moments in rock history.\n\nHis trip to Britan had given his music a springboard to the United States and in the years that followed, Jimi Hendrix rocketed to become an international success. His untimely demise in 1970 was a sudden and grievous shock to the those who had come to know Jimi Hendrix and his music.\n=========================================================================\n\nThe best video/audio players to play this movie are: \n\nFree DivX Player\nWindows: http://www.divx.com/divx/windows/\nMac: http://www.divx.com/divx/mac/?cid=DP0000279\n\nVLC (VideoLan)\nhttp://www.videolan.org/\n\nThe KM Player\nhttp://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=4094\n\n========================================================================================\nPlease be patient &amp; continue to share after your download completes. \nThe more who share, the faster everyone can get the file. \n\nTo all who post comments: Thank you &amp; we appreciate your feedback.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9802a4f015821e0993ecf1a4b49731fd62de7807","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+Live+Georgia%2CUSA%5B1970-58min%5D%5BA+LordOfWar+Release%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9802a4f015821e0993ecf1a4b49731fd62de7807","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,2,164,240,21,130,30,9,147,236,241,164,180,151,49,253,98,222,120,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
