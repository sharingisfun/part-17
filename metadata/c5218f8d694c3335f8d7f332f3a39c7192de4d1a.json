While Nyssa (Sarah Sutton) leaves half way through the season in 'Terminus'. Mark Strickson arrives as new companion Vislor Turlough in 'Mawdryn Undead'. In the penultimate serial of the season, the shape-shifting android Kamelion (voiced by Gerald Flood) was invited aboard the TARDIS after the Doctor freed him from the Master.
