If those states which did\nnot have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992,\napproximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate assaults\nwould have been avoided yearly. On the other hand, consistent with the notion\nof criminals responding to incentives, we find criminals substituting into\nproperty crimes involving stealth and where the probabilities of contact between\nthe criminal and the victim are minimal. The largest population counties where\nthe deterrence effect on violent crimes is greatest are where the substitution effect\ninto property crimes is highest. Concealed handguns also have their greatest\ndeterrent effect in the highest crime counties. Higher arrest and conviction rates\nconsistently and dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent with other recent\nwork (Lott, 1992b), the results imply that increasing the arrest rate, independent\nof the probability of eventual conviction, imposes a significant penalty on\ncriminals. The estimated annual gain from allowing concealed handguns is at\nleast $6.214 billion.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff02b89f18410c2cbb493ff969280927a984aa1","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Crime%2C+Deterrence%2C+and+Right-to-Carry+Concealed+Handguns.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff02b89f18410c2cbb493ff969280927a984aa1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,240,43,137,241,132,16,194,203,180,147,255,150,146,128,146,122,152,74,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
