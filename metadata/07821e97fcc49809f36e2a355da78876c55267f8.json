Picking up the pseudo-mysticism and Native American obsessions of the Doors, the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin, and the three-chord crunch of AC/DC, while adding touches of post-punk goth rock, the Cult gained a dedicated following in their native Britain with mid-'80s singles like &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; before breaking into the American metal market in the late '80s with &quot;Love Removal Machine.&quot; Though they managed one Top Ten in America with 1989's Sonic Temple, the Cult were plagued with off-stage tensions and problems that prevented them from retaining their popularity. The band split in 1995 following a pair of unsuccessful records, but returned on an occasional basis for new records -- always anchored by vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t99.95% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tBeggars Banquet\nCatalog:\t\tBEGA 2026 CD\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.She Sells Sanctuary\n02.Fire Woman\n03.Lil' Devil\n04.Spiritwalker\n05.The Witch\n06.Revolution\n07.Love Removal Machine\n08.Rain\n09.In The Clouds\n10.Coming Down\n11.Edie (Ciao Baby)\n12.Heart Of Soul\n13.Wild Flower\n14.Star\n15.Resurrection Joe\n16.Go West\n17.Sun King\n18.Wild Hearted Son\n19.Sweet Soul Sister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07821e97fcc49809f36e2a355da78876c55267f8","amp;dn":"The+Cult+-+Pure+Cult+The+Singles+%2784-%2795+%282000%29+Flac+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07821e97fcc49809f36e2a355da78876c55267f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,130,30,151,252,196,152,9,243,110,42,53,93,167,136,118,197,82,103,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
