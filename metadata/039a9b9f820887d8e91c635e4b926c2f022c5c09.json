Packed with newly transferred archive film of Spitfires, Hurricanes and Wellingtons, it also features many rarely-seen aircraft from that period including Defiants, Battles, Gladiators Ansons and many more. Duration: 94 mins\n\nThere is a filmed account of a Blenheim raid, a Sunderland sortie over Norway and Churchill reviewing new American imports for the RAF such as the P-40, the B-17 and the Douglas Boston. It also shows the wonderful work done under wartime conditions by the aircraft manufacturers, the air ministry and the training of RAF recruits.\n\nTwo extra short films (1 min &amp; 4 mins) show an inspection of the Air Ministry by HM King George VI and a visit to the RAF Eagle Squadrons made up of foreign volunteer pilots, including many Americans.\n\nThese films are of great historical importance and are essential viewing for anyone interested in aviation history.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:039a9b9f820887d8e91c635e4b926c2f022c5c09","amp;dn":"RAF+at+War+1939+-+1941","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"039a9b9f820887d8e91c635e4b926c2f022c5c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,154,155,159,130,8,135,216,233,28,99,94,75,146,108,47,2,44,92,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
