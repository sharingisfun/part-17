In this case, there are 40 songs here in a distinctly folk and pop/cabaret vein, mastered in state of the art sound, that capture some of Faithfull's best moments on various singles and her LPs, alas not in chronological order -- she became a better, less self-conscious singer as she went on, and the material here, running right up to her 1967 Decca single &quot;Is This What I Get for Loving You,&quot; embodies some of her best work, nicely annotated and well mastered, and the price is definitely right as a budget double-CD set. - Review by Bruce Eder\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Blowin' In The Wind\n[02] Come And Stay With Me\n[03] House Of The Rising Sun\n[04] Spanish Is A Rising Tongue\n[05] Fare Thee Well\n[06] Lonesome Traveller\n[07] Down In The Salley Gardens\n[08] Mary Ann\n[09] Full Fathom Five\n[10] Four Strong Winds\n[11] Black Girl\n[12] Once I Had A Sweetheart\n[13] Bells Of Freedom\n[14] Yesterday\n[15] This Little Bird\n[16] Summer Nights\n[17] Is This What I Get For Loving You\n[18] Go Away From My World\n[19] That's Right Baby\n[20] Morning Sun\n\n\tCD-01 Play Time - 00h:50m:58s\n\nCD-02 Track Listings\n\n[01] The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\n[02] Sunny Goodge Street\n[03] Green Are Your Eyes\n[04] Scarborough Fair\n[05] Coquillages\n[06] Monday, Monday\n[07] Tomorrow's Calling\n[08] If I Never Get To Love You\n[09] Time Takes Time\n[10] He'll Come Back To Me\n[11] Down Town\n[12] Plaisir D'Amour\n[13] Can't You Hear My Heartbeat\n[14] Paris Bells\n[15] They Never Will Leave You\n[16] I'm A Loser\n[17] What Have I Done Wrong\n[18] Sally Free And Easy\n[19] North Country Maid\n[20] Wild Mountain Thyme\n\n\tCD-02 Play Time - 00h:55m:31s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 01h:46m:29s\nTotal File Size....................... 2536mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
