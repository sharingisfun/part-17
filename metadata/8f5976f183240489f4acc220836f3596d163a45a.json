Science made the idea of a Creator irrelevantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ or so Strobel thought.\n\nHas science discovered God? At the very least, it&amp;#039;s giving faith an immense boost as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of life and our universe. In The Case for a Creator DVD, Strobel reexamines the theories that once led him away from God.\n\nHighlighted by spectacular computer animation, The Case for a Creator DVD is a remarkable film in which you&amp;#039;ll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness.\n\nThis video provides amazing and irrefutable evidence that points to a Divine Creator. This is a great video for any of you who are proponents of Darwin&amp;#039;s theories... because if you TRULY value keeping an open mind, this is the compelling &quot;other side of the argument&quot; that you don&amp;#039;t often hear. I hope that you&amp;#039;ll choose to watch this and to come to your own conclusions afterward. \n\nIf you are a believer then watch this video to build up your faith. It will cement your faith in the word of God, the Bible and what it preaches.\n\nKindly Seed for as long as possible. According to the Bible, faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains...so keep seeding and moving mountains of unbelief. :-)\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f5976f183240489f4acc220836f3596d163a45a","amp;dn":"Lee+Strobel+-+The+Case+for+a+Creator+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f5976f183240489f4acc220836f3596d163a45a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,89,118,241,131,36,4,137,244,172,194,32,131,111,53,150,209,99,164,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
