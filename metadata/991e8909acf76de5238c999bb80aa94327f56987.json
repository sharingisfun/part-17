He came to prominence as an early participant in London's pub rock scene in the mid-1970s and later became associated with the punk/New Wave genre. Steeped in word play, the vocabulary of Costello's lyrics is broader than that of most popular songs. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a &quot;pop encyclopedia,&quot; able to &quot;reinvent the past in his own image&quot;.\nCostello was born Declan Patrick MacManus in St Mary's Hospital, London, the son of Lilian Alda (nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e Ablett, b. 1927, Liverpool) and Ross MacManus, a musician and bandleader. He is of Irish heritage. Costello lived in Twickenham, attending Hounslow Secondary Modern School, which is now St Mark's Catholic Secondary School, in neighbouring Hounslow. With a musically inclined father (who was a jazz trumpeter and sang with The Joe Loss Orchestra), Costello's first broadcast recording was alongside his dad in a television commercial for R. White's Lemonade (I'm a Secret Lemonade Drinker). His father wrote and sang the song; Costello provided backing vocals. The advertisement won a silver award at the 1974 International Advertising Festival.\nCostello moved with his Liverpool-born mother to Birkenhead in 1971. There, he formed his first band, a folk duo called Rusty, with Allan Mayes. After completing secondary school at St. Francis Xavier's College, he moved back to London where he next formed a band called Flip City, which had a style in the pub rock vein. They were active from 1974 through to early 1976. Around this time, Costello adopted the stage name D.P. Costello. His father had performed under the name Day Costello, and Elvis has said in interviews that he took this name as a tribute to his father.\n\n.: Elvis Costello :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/7241/img295copia.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img718.imageshack.us/img718/7241/img295copia.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1977 My Aim Is True (Expanded, 2 CD) @320\n1978 This Years Model @320\n1979 Armed Forces @320\n1980 Get Happy!! @320\n1981 Almost Blue @320\n1981 Trust @320\n1982 Imperial Bedroom (remastered with bonus tracks) @320\n1983 Punch The Clock @320\n1984 Goodbye Cruel World @320\n1986 Blood &amp; Chocolate (Ryko Bonus Tracks) @320\n1986 King Of America @320\n1989 Spike (Expanded, 2 CD) @320\n1991 Mighty Like a Rose @320\n1993 Elvis Costello &amp; Brodsky Quartet-The Juliet Letters @320\n1994 Brutal Youth @320\n1995 Kojak Variety @320\n1996 Elvis Costello and The Attractions-All This Useless Beauty @320\n1998 Elvis Costello &amp; Bill Frisell-Sweetest Punch The Songs of Costello and Bacharach @320\n1998 Elvis Costello &amp; Burt Bacharach-Painted from Memory @320\n2001 For the Stars-Anne Sofie Von Otter Meets Elvis Costello @320\n2002 When I Was Cruel @320\n2003 North @320\n2004 Elvis Costello &amp; The Imposters-The Delivery Man @320\n2004 Il Sogno @320\n2006 Elvis Costello &amp; Allen Toussaint - The River in Reverse @320\n2008 Momofuku @320\n2009 Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane @320\n\nLive albums\n1978 Live at the El Mocambo (2009) @320\n1995 Deep Dead Blue, Live at Meltdown with Bill Frisell @320\n2006 My Flame Burns Blue (2 CD) @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1980 - Ten Bloody Marys &amp; Ten How's Your Fathers @320\n1985 - The Best of Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions @320\n1994 - The Very Best of Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions @320\n2001 - The Very Best of Elvis Costello (2 CD) @320\n2002 - Cruel Smile @320\n2007 - Rock and Roll Music @320\n2007 - The Best of Elvis Costello The First 10 Years @320\n\nSome bootlegs\n1977-10-22 Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions-Leicester University, UK @320\n1978-06-07 Winterland (Sbd FM) @320\n1978-11-03 Toronto early @320\n1978-11-03 Toronto late @320\n1983-08-08 NYC (with Count Basie Orchestra &amp; Tony Bennett) @320\n1983-09-07 The Gangster Is Back (Sbd) @320\n1986-10-22 Elvis Costello &amp; The Confederates-Live On Broadway (1995) @320\n1989-09-15 Berkeley (2 CD) @320\n1996-05-21 Elvis Costello and Steve Nieve, New York 1996 @320\n1998-10-29 Elvis Costello &amp; Burt Bacharach, Royal Festival Hall, London @320\n1999-01-05 with The Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra Stockholm @320\n1999-06-16 Elvis Costello and Steve Nieve.
