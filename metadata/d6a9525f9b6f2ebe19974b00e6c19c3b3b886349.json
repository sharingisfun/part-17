However, Summer's \nnotable songwriting capabilities, in addition to her collaborations with \nproducer-songwriters Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte, were able to set her \napart from rivals in the industry.\n\nThough she is most notable for her disco hits, Summer's repertoire has \nexpanded to include contemporary R&amp;B, rock, mainstream pop, and even \ngospel. Summer is one of the most successful female recording artists of the \n1970s and 1980s, and still holds the record for having three consecutive \ndouble albums hit #1 on the Billboard charts. She also became the first female \nartist to have four number-one singles in a twelve-month period. According to \nher official MySpace page, Summer has sold over 130 million records \nworldwide \n\nBorn in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, she was one \nof seven children raised by devout Christian parents. She sang in church, and \nin her teens joined a funk group called The Crow, so named because Donna \nwas the only black member of the group. At eighteen, Gaines left home and \nschool to take up a supporting role in the Broadway musical, Hair. \nUnsuccessful in getting a the part in the Broadway show (Melba Moore got \nthe role), she was offered the European Tour when the show moved to \nGermany, where Summer also performed in the German versions of several \nmusicals including Godspell and Show Boat. She settled in Munich and also \nperformed with the Viennese Folk Opera and the pop band Munich Machine.\n\nIn 1971, Gaines released a single in Europe entitled &quot;Sally Go 'Round The \nRoses&quot;, her first solo recording. The single was unsuccessful, however, and \nshe had to wait until 1974 to launch a solo career. Gaines married Austrian \nactor Helmuth Sommer (&quot;Summer&quot; is an Anglicization of his last name) in 1972 \nand gave birth to daughter Mimi the following year. Summer did various \nmusical jobs in studios and theaters for several years, including the pop \ngroup FamilyTree from 1974-75\n\nEarly success and notoriety\nWhile singing back-up for groups such as Three Dog Night, she met producers \nGiorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte. With these producers, Summer signed a \ncontract in the Netherlands and issued her first album, Lady of the Night, \nwhich included the European hit, &quot;The Hostage&quot;. The single made #1 in \nFrance and Belgium, and #2 in the Netherlands. Its follow-up, the title track \nof the album, also gained some degree of European success.\n\nIn the summer of 1975, Summer approached Moroder and Bellotte with an \nidea for a song. She had come up with the lyric &quot;Love to love you, baby&quot; as \nthe possible title for the song. Moroder was interested in developing the new \ndisco sound that was becoming increasingly popular, and used Summer's lyric \nto develop the song into a disco track. He had the idea that she should moan \nand groan orgasmically, but Summer was reticent. Eventually she agreed to \nrecord the song as a demo. She has stated that she was not completely sure \nof some of the lyrics, and parts of the song were improvised during the \nrecording. Donna later stated on a VH-1 &quot;Behind The Music&quot; program that she \npictured herself as Marilyn Monroe acting out the part of someone in sexual \necstasy). Moroder was so astounded with Summer's orgasmic vocals that he \ninsisted she release the single herself. The song, titled &quot;Love to Love You&quot;, \nwas released to modest success in Europe. When it reached America and the \nhands of Casablanca president Neil Bogart, however, he was so ecstatic over \nthe demo that he asked Moroder to produce a twenty-minute version of the \nsong. Summer, Moroder and producer Pete Bellotte cut a seventeen-minute \nversion, renamed it &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;, and Casablanca signed \nSummer and issued it as a single in November 1975. Casablanca distributed \nSummer's work in the US while other labels distributed it in different nations \nduring this period.\n\n&quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot; was Summer's first big hit in America, reaching #2 \non the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in early 1976 and becoming her first \nNumber-One Hot Dance Club Play chart hit. The album (side one of which was \ncompletely taken up with the full-length version of the title track) was also \nreleased in late 1975 and was soon certified Gold for sales of over 500,000 \nUS copies. The song was branded &quot;graphic&quot; by some music critics and was \neven banned by some radio stations for its explicit content. Time magazine \nreported that 22 orgasms were simulated in the making of the song, and \nsome of the music press dubbed Summer &quot;the first lady of love.&quot; Two \nsuccessful, Gold-selling concept albums followed: A Love Trilogy which \nfeatured the single &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; and Four Seasons Of Love which \nfeatured the uptempo &quot;Spring Affair&quot; as well as the ballad &quot;Winter Melody&quot; \nwhich was a top 30 hit in the UK - the first of Donna's singles to be aired on \nRadio 1 and a hit on the US R&amp;B charts.\n\nThe 1977 album I Remember Yesterday, another concept album, found the \nSummer/Moroder/Bellotte team combining the Disco sound with musical \nelements of the past, present and future. The song representing the future, \n&quot;I Feel Love&quot; became a landmark recording, giving Donna another Pop and \nR&amp;B hit reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and number one in \nthe UK. &quot;I Feel Love&quot; earned her a second US Gold Single as well. The song's \nuse of raw techno and electronic sounds was revolutionary and popularized \nsynthesizers in dance, rock, and the burgeoning new wave.\n\nSummer released another album in 1977, Once Upon A Time, a concept album \ntelling a modern-day Cinderella &quot;rags to riches&quot; story through the means of \nelectronic disco.\n\n\n Continued success in music\nIn 1978 Summer acted in the film Thank God It's Friday and released the \nsingle &quot;Last Dance&quot; which became her third US million-selling single. Written by \nthe late Paul Jabara ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ who also co-wrote &quot;It's Raining Men&quot;, &quot;The Main Event \n(Fight)&quot; and &quot;No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ the song became \nanother major hit for Summer, reaching #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and \nresulting in her first Grammy win. Jabara took home the Oscar after the song \nwas nominated for Song Of The Year. Summer also recorded a side-long \nversion of Serge Gainsbourg's &quot;Je T'Aime (Moi Non Plus)&quot; which was very \nsimilar in style to &quot;Love to Love You, Baby&quot;, initially shelved and later released \nas a part of the Thank God It's Friday soundtrack.\n\nThat same year, Donna released her first live album, Live and More. It \nknocked Linda Ronstadt's triple Platinum 'Living In The USA' out of the #1 \nposition on Billboard's Album Chart. This was Summer's first #1 album as well \nas her first to reach the million-selling Platinum mark. It included her first #1 \nAmerican Pop single, a cover of the Jimmy Webb-penned &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; - \nanother Gold-certified US 45 - originally made famous by the late actor/singer \nRichard Harris. The studio part of the album included the tracks &quot;One Of A \nKind&quot; and &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; which also featured vocals by Joe &quot;Bean&quot; Esposito \nof the Brooklyn Dreams (group member Bruce Sudano would later become \nromantically involved with Summer). &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; became another Gold \nUS Record and another Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nSummer was also a guest artist on Kiss bassist Gene Simmons's 1978 \neponymous solo album.\n\n\n Bad Girls and the break from disco\nIn 1979, Summer released the landmark double-album Bad Girls. Unusual for a \ndisco album, it mixed Rock, Funk, Blues and Soul into electronic beats. It \nyielded three consecutive million-selling singles: the back-to-back #1 hits &quot;Hot \nStuff&quot; and &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, and the #2 hit &quot;Dim All The Lights&quot;. &quot;Bad Girls&quot; also \nbecame Summer's first #1 song on Billboard's R&amp;B singles chart. With US \nrecord sales at an all-time apex in 1979, Summer had a straight run of five US \nGold singles (three of which went on to Platinum status) that year alone. &quot;Hot \nStuff&quot; won Summer a second Grammy, for Best Female Rock Vocal \nPerformance. (Interestingly, the Grammies had a Best Disco Recording Award \nonly once, in 1980, won by Gloria Gaynor for her I Will Survive single.) Bad \nGirls became Summer's second #1 album and the most successful album of \nher entire career - going Multi-Platinum in the US. Summer and Bruce Sudano \ngrew closer during the making of this album and became engaged. During this \nperiod, Summer had two songs in the top three of Billboard's Hot 100 during \nthe same week, with &quot;Bad Girls&quot; and &quot;Hot Stuff&quot;. Just a few months later, she \naccomplished the same feat again, with &quot;No More Tears&quot; and &quot;Dim All the \nLights&quot;. During the summer of 1979, she played eight sold-out nights at the \nUniversal Amphitheater in Los Angeles.\n\nSummer's first compilation album, On The Radio: Greatest Hits Volumes 1 &amp; 2, \nwas a global smash and her third straight #1 US album - also going multi-\nplatinum. With this, Summer became the first artist to have three consecutive \nnumber-one double-albums. The album also contained two new tracks - &quot;No \nMore Tears (Enough Is Enough)&quot;, a Platinum-selling #1 duet with Barbra \nStreisand, and the Grammy-nominated Top Five Gold hit &quot;On the Radio&quot;, a \nsong written for the film Foxes. The Streisand-Summer duet was her fourth \nand final #1 Pop hit in the U.S - and her fourth #1 single in 12 months. \nAfterwards, disagreements between Summer and Casablanca Records led to \nher exit from the label in 1980. Summer was given a lucrative offer by David \nGeffen and became the first artist to be signed to his new Geffen label in \n1980.\n\n\n The Wanderer and She Works Hard for the Money\nSummer's first Geffen release, 1980's The Wanderer, was something of a \ndeparture, in some ways closer to a rock/new wave affair. The title track, \nand accompanying singles &quot;Cold Love&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You're Foolin'?&quot; \nsaw Summer attempting to reach the same audience dominated by \ncontemporaries like Blondie and Pat Benatar. The title track was another \nmillion-selling hit, reaching #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earning her yet \nanother Gold single in the States. The album peaked at #13 on the US album \ncharts and earned a Gold album certification in the US. Her next album, I'm a \nRainbow, a new wave - oriented double album which also featured elements \nof Soul, R&amp;B, period British techno-pop and even synth-based Disco, was \nshelved by Geffen (although two of the tracks would surface during the \n1980s on the Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Flashdance film \nsoundtracks). Reluctantly, Summer left Moroder after seven years of \ncollaboration, and began work with Quincy Jones.\n\nIn 1982 Geffen released the Gold-certified, self-titled Donna Summer, and \nthe new production from Quincy Jones was again in the Top 10 of the Pop, \nR&amp;B, and Dance charts with the Grammy-nominated &quot;Love Is In Control \n(Finger On The Trigger)&quot;. A second single, &quot;State of Independence&quot;, on which \nMichael Jackson sang background along with a veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of the \nmusic world, became a sizable international hit but a minor hit in the US. One \nmore single from the album followed, &quot;The Woman In Me&quot;, later recorded by \nAnn Wilson &amp; Nancy Wilson of the rock group Heart. It peaked at #33 on the \nHot 100 and #30 on the R&amp;B chart.\n\nIn 1983 Summer scored her biggest triumph since Bad Girls with the release of \nthe album, She Works Hard for the Money. The title track became one of her \nmost played songs. The Grammy-nominated hit also became a pro-feminist \nanthem and was a staple on MTV, making her the first black woman to have a \nvideo air in heavy rotation on the channel. The single was also Summer's \nbiggest-ever R&amp;B hit (#1 for three weeks) and had frequent play on BET. It \nwas released on PolyGram's Mercury Records to settle a legal dispute \nfollowing PolyGram's absorption of Casablanca. It was Summer's 6th LP in a \nrow to feature a Billboard Top Ten Hit. A second single from the She Works \nHard For The Money album, the reggae-flavored &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; \nfeatured vocals by British band Musical Youth and outsold the first single in \nthe UK, but stopped short of the US Top 40.\n\nHer subsequent Geffen releases did not fare as well. 1984's Cats Without \nClaws peaked at #40 on Billboard's Album Chart while 1987's All Systems Go \nstalled at #122 on the chart with no major hits. The first single, Dinner with \nGershwin was a sizable international hit as well as being a Top Ten US R&amp;B \nhit. However, it was not enough to heal the difficult relationship with David \nGeffen. Summer left Geffen Records in 1988 to sign with Atlantic Records \nwhen he refused to release her next LP; ironically, it would become another \nhit release.\n\nIn the early 80's rumors began circulating that Donna had allegedly made \nanti-gay comments regarding the AIDS epidemic as punishment for \nhomosexuality. Summer denied making such remarks, and finally filed a \nlawsuit against New York magazine for its reporting of the rumors in a concert \nreview. According to an A&amp;E Biography program which Donna participated, \nthe lawsuit was settled out of court with neither side admitting guilt. Summer \ndenies making them.\n\n\n Later career\nSummer briefly regained her hit luster again in 1989 with Another Place and \nTime, an album-length collaboration with British top dance-pop songwriting \nand production team Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman known as \nStock Aitken Waterman. &quot;This Time I Know It's For Real&quot; became Summer's \nfourteenth Top 10 Billboard Pop hit in the US and returned to her to Gold-\nsingle status. It was also a huge success on Adult Contemporary radio, \nholding at #2 for four weeks. Another track, &quot;I Don't Wanna Get Hurt&quot;, was a \nTop Ten UK hit. The follow-up US single, &quot;Love's About To Change My Heart&quot;, \nbecame a Dance chart hit but stalled at #85 on the Pop chart. In 1991, she \nreleased the album Mistaken Identity, which incorporated New Jack Swing \nand Urban Contemporary into her music. The album was not a success and \nsold less than 50,000 copies, failing to even appear on the Billboard Album \nChart (it barely scraped into the R&amp;B Albums chart at #97). Summer scored a \ntop twenty R&amp;B hit with &quot;When Love Cries&quot; but her days of mainstream \nsuccess in the United States seemed behind her. However, the following \nyear, Summer received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The year also \nsaw her collaborate with Giorgio Moroder for the first time in over a decade \nwith the song &quot;Carry On&quot;. First featured on his Forever Dancing album, the \nfollowing year the track would be featured on the double album The Donna \nSummer Anthology. This compilation also featured two exclusive remixes from \nthe unreleased I'm a Rainbow album recorded back in 1981.\n\nA gospel-influenced Christmas album entitled Christmas Spirit in 1994 became \nSummer's first full-length album in over three years, and a new compilation \nentitled Endless Summer (both released by PolyGram) also contained new \ntracks, including &quot;Melody of Love (Wanna Be Loved)&quot;, which became the \nyear's # 1 Billboard hit on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nIn 1995, a re-release of &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (with newly recorded vocals) as a \ndance remix, became a hit again in the UK, reaching #8 there. The following \nyear she would score another Top 20 there with a new remix of &quot;State of \nIndependence&quot;. In 1996, Summer's album I'm a Rainbow was finally released \nby Polygram's Mercury Records after a 15 year delay.\n\nIn 1994 and 1997 she played the role of &quot;Aunt Oona from Altoona&quot; on Family \nMatters. She also sang &quot;Last Dance&quot; in Oona's first episode.\n\nIn 1995, she also participated in the Edith Piaf: Tribute album, with her cover \nfor the song&quot;La Vie En Rose&quot;.\n\n1996 saw Donna collaborating in several others artists' projects:\n\n&quot;Does He Love You?&quot; duet with Liza Minnelli for Liza's album Gently; \n&quot;Whenever There Is Love&quot; duet with Bruce Roberts for the Daylight OST \n(recording also a version in Spanish); &quot;From A Distance&quot; with Nanci Griffith \nAnd Raul Malo for the &quot;One Voice&quot; project; and &quot;Someday&quot; for the CD Mouse \nHouse Remixes (Song From Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre Dame OST).\n\nIn 1998, Summer was the first artist to receive a Grammy award for Best \nDance Recording for her 1992 collaboration with Giorgio Moroder, &quot;Carry On&quot;, \nafter the song was remixed and released as a single. In 1999, Summer \nstarred in a televised live concert on the VH1 network entitled Donna Summer \n- Live and More Encore. The special earned the network their highest ratings \nof the year, second only to their annual Divas concert. Performing a string of \nher classics and new singles, she also sang &quot;Dim All the Lights&quot; as a tribute to \nRod Stewart. Summer acknowledges that she wrote the song for Stewart but \nrecorded it herself. She also performed an updated version of &quot;No More \nTears&quot; with Australian pop diva Tina Arena. A live CD of the special (on the \nEpic label) and DVD of the special were released, returning the singer back to \nthe U.S. albums chart, selling close to half a million copies in the USA. Summer \nscored two # 1 dance hits that year with &quot;I Will Go with You (Con te partirÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â²)&quot; \nand &quot;Love Is the Healer&quot; (both found as new studio tracks on the live album). \nShe also collaborated with the song &quot;My Prayer For You&quot; in the project Sing \nMe To Sleep, Mommy. During that year, Summer recorded the theme song for \nPokÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©mon: The Movie 2000, entitled &quot;The Power of One&quot;. Around this time, \nSummer also recorded the song &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; for the Naturally Native \nOriginal Soundtrack. In 2000, she continued collaborating with other artists in \ndifferent albums: for the project Child of the Promise she delivered &quot;When \nthe Dream Never Dies&quot; and the duet with Crystal Lewis, &quot;I Cannot Be Silent&quot;. \nFor The Mercy Project album, she recorded the song &quot;Take Heart&quot; and for \nDarwin Hobbs' Vertical CD, she duetted &quot;When I Look Up&quot;.\n\n\nIn 2003, a greatest-hits compilation called The Journey was released, which \nreached the UK Top 10 in the following year. Here she included new tracks \nlike &quot;That's The Way&quot;, &quot;Dream A Lots Theme (I Will Live For Love)&quot; and also a \nnew track &quot;You're So Beautiful&quot; in a remixed version.\n\nOn September 20, 2004, Summer was among the first artists to be inducted \ninto the newly formed Dance Music Hall of Fame in New York City. She was \ninducted in two categories, Artist Inductees, alongside fellow disco legends \nThe Bee Gees and Barry White; and Record Inductees, for her classic hit &quot;I \nFeel Love&quot;. Summer added to her achievements in October 2004 when she \nperformed &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch at Game 2 \nof the 2004 World Series at Boston's Fenway Park.\n\n\n Crayons\nIn May of 2008, Summer released her first album of new material in 17 years, \nCrayons, on Sony BMG imprint Burgundy Records. Remixes of the track &quot;I'm A \nFire&quot; reached #1 on the U.S. Dance Chart.\n\nThe first official single, &quot;Stamp Your Feet&quot;, was released in April, 2008. \nCrayons debuted at a lofty #17, making this her all-time highest debut on the \nUS Album Chart and her highest charting album since She Works Hard For The \nMoney reached #9 twenty-five years earlier.\n\nSummer is the first artist ever to have a #1 Billboard Dance hit in each of the \npast four decades. &quot;I'm A Fire&quot; and &quot;Stamp Your Feet&quot; are Donna Summer's \n19th and 20th #1 Billboard singles of her career and her 28th and 29th Top \nTen Billboard singles. \n\n\n Awards and recognition\nSummer is the recipient of five Grammy Awards. [6] \nSummer placed a top forty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in every year from \n1976 (&quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;) to 1984 (&quot;There Goes My Baby&quot;). \nSummer is the first female artist to have four #1 singles in a 12-month period, \nand the first female artist to have five Billboard Hot 100 Top Ten hits in a \ncalendar year. \nSummer became the first and only artist to score three consecutive number-\none double albums, and to have three number-one pop singles in the same \nyear. \nSummer is the first artist to have two singles in the top three slots of the \nBillboard Hot 100 at the same time, and accomplished this feat twice. \nSummer was twice honored by the Dance Music Hall of Fame; once with her \ninduction as a recording artist and again with the induction for her influential \nsingle &quot;I Feel Love&quot;.\nSummer's music career has landed her as the eighth most successful female \nrecording artist in history according to Billboard. \nSummer's career span of Billboard #1 Disco/Club Play hits spans from 1975's \n&quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; through 2008's &quot;Stamp Your Feet&quot;. \n\n Cover versions by other artists\nSummer's recording of &quot;I Feel Love&quot; is one of the most sampled recordings in \nmusic history. The song has been sampled by Madonna, Whitney Houston, \nBette Midler, Diana Ross, Moloko, Britney Spears, Robbie Williams, Mylo, \nDavid Guetta, Stuart Price, Moby and many more. &quot;I Feel Love&quot; was recorded \nby classical pop musician Vanessa-Mae for her 1998 album Storm.\n\nSummer's &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; was also sampled by Beyonce Knowles. \n&quot;I Feel Love&quot; has been covered onstage by Madonna, the Red Hot Chili \nPeppers' John Frusciante, Kylie Minogue, Blondie, Basement Jaxx, and \nFinnish progressive rock band Kingston Wall. Venus Hum with Blue Man Group \nalso performed this song with Japanese singer Koda Kumi for their album The \nComplex, and in 2006, Tracy Bonham stood in for Hum on the Blue Man Group \ntour, performing the song. Bronski Beat and Marc Almond released the track \nas a duet with an added bridge section and titled it &quot;I Feel Love/Johnny \nRemember Me&quot;, reaching number 3 in the UK charts in April 1985. In 1992 \nU.K. alterna-pop group Curve recorded a version for the NME's 40th \nanniversary compilation Ruby Trax, which became an instant underground \nclassic. Madonna's production team sampled this for her 2006 Confessions \nTour and album, Confessions On A Dance Floor. &quot;Future Lovers&quot; contains a \nsample of &quot;I Feel Love&quot;. \nSummer's &quot;Starting Over Again&quot; was a number one hit on the Hot Country \nSongs chart for Dolly Parton in 1980.
