The Grand Final of ESWC will be held in Paris from June 28th to July the 2nd , in front of 40,000 people, where the best players from each country will battle it out for a prize of 400,000 dollars.\n\nThis special version features a brand new environment, the Stadium, and a revolutionary new gameplay designed for Nadeo&amp;#039;s own custom cars. Nadeo has pulled the technological rabbit from the hat with their own brand game engine, featuring the series&amp;#039; best graphics yet, finely tuned for the latest generation graphics cards, not forgetting simpler machines so that no one round the world has a technical freeze out on the race track.
