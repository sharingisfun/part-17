ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Monday morning, and she is late for work again. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shocked to see the near-empty vodka bottle on her kitchen counter. It was full at noon yesterday; surely she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drink that much last night? As she struggles out the door, she fights the urge to have a sip, just to take the edge off. But no, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to drink today.\n\nBut this is the day ColleenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demons come for her. A very bad day spirals into night as a series of flashbacks take the reader through ColleenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pastÃ¢â‚¬â€moments of friendship and loss, fragments of peace and possibility. The single constant is the bottle, always close by, ColleenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst enemy and her only friend.\n\nIn this unforgettable work, acclaimed novelist Lauren B. Davis has created as searing, raw and powerful a portrayal of the chaos and pain of alcoholism as we have encountered in fiction. Told with compassion, insight and an irresistible gallows humour, The Empty Room takes us to the depths of addiction, only to find a revelation at its heart: the importance and grace of one person reaching out to another.\nGenre: Fiction/General\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867cf5571124f9314e326ef2e49b06542912256a","amp;dn":"The_Empty_Room_-_Lauren_B._Davis.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867cf5571124f9314e326ef2e49b06542912256a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,124,245,87,17,36,249,49,78,50,110,242,228,155,6,84,41,18,37,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
