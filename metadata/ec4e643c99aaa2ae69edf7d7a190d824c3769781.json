Two months after one scorchingly hot July night, tattoo artist Abby is pregnant and the man who showed her everything sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been missing is nowhere in sight. When he walks into the Hot Ink Tattoo Studio looking for much more than some new ink, she risks their rekindled connection by confessing that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pregnant Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ with his twins.\n\nSworn to serve and protect, Pittsburgh police officer Sam isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one to back down from responsibility, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely not going to let the woman whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been haunting his dreams all summer get away again. But two babies on the way means a reunion thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anything but what he imagined. Can unforgettable chemistry evolve into real love before her due date arrives?\n\nInked in the Steel City Book 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec4e643c99aaa2ae69edf7d7a190d824c3769781","amp;dn":"Dedicated+Ink+-+Ranae+Rose.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec4e643c99aaa2ae69edf7d7a190d824c3769781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,78,100,60,153,170,162,174,105,237,247,215,161,144,216,36,195,118,151,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
