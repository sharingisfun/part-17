Composers Giya Kancheli and \nJohn Tavener are frequently classified as &quot;holy minimalists,&quot; but the \ndesignation &quot;holy post-modernist&quot; would be more accurate, if decidedly less \nspiritual sounding. Both composers are products of secular societies, have \ndeveloped a preoccupation with spiritual topics in their music, and have \nrejected the prevailing modernism of their times in favor of a style, which in \nspite of its emotional directness and simplicity can't by any stretch of the \nimagination be legitimately characterized as minimalism. One characteristic \nthat links Kancheli and the other so-called &quot;holy minimalists&quot; such as GÃƒÂ³recki \nand PÃƒÂ¤rt is the earnest sobriety of their music. It would be ungenerous to \ncharacterize the work of such a diverse group of composers as humorless, \nbut (particularly among those who suffered for the bulk of their professional \nlives under the artistic restrictions of the Eastern Bloc) their work is often \nnotable for its relentlessly somber tone. That is the case of the two works \nrecorded here. The darkness of the viola in its lower register and the \nagonized wail of its absolutely highest notes make it an apt vehicle for \nKancheli's and Tavener's sober and sometimes anguished visions, and they \nwrite for it with great expressiveness. Both composers use the chorus \norchestrally, more to create a particular textural color than to convey textual \ncontent, and their choral writing is inventive and colorful. The works are \nharmonically sumptuous and richly imagined, and they have an undeniably \npowerful emotional fiber. Violist Maxim Rysanov and conductor MÃƒÂ¡ris Sirmais, \nleading the Liepaja Symphony Orchestra, the youth choir, KamerÃ¢â‚¬Â¦, and the \nState Choir Latvija perform with all the virtuosity and wrenching intensity the \nworks require.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab61ca12e1c31c221fffc9d7b2ec5b425caee38","amp;dn":"Kancheli%2C+Styx+-+Tavener%2C+The+Myrrh-Bearer+-+Maxim+Rysanov+%5Bflac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab61ca12e1c31c221fffc9d7b2ec5b425caee38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,182,28,161,46,28,49,194,33,255,252,157,123,46,197,180,37,202,238,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
