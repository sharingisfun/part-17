It features download resuming, accelerating, scheduling and more...just read on!\n\n\nDownload Big Files?\n    Never have to restart at the beginning after downloading 100&amp;#039;s of Megabytes again.\n\n    It doesn&amp;#039;t matter how fast your connection is, if you download big popular files like game demos, Linux installs, or videos, you can still have problems with disconnections or slow servers. GetRight&amp;#039;s resuming and acceleration will make your downloads painless and easy--and as fast as possible.\n\n    As this picture shows, even at a good speed, a download can still take hours.\n\n    This picture shows how you can see the progress as GetRight downloads different parts of the file at the same time. The colored bars show how different parts of the file are downloading at once--a faster server would fill its block, then jump to help fill another part of the file.\n    Read more about resuming downloads and saving broken connections.\n\nWant to get many files from a website?\n    If you want to collect images, music, or other files from a website, GetRight will be a lifesaver. It has several tools to easily scan a whole website to extract and download just the files you want!\n\n    Even rescan the same website later and just download the new or changed files, saving you even more time.\n    Read more about server synchronization.\n\nEver lose a download?\n    If you&amp;#039;ve ever downloaded a file, then been unable to find it on your computer, GetRight will save you lots of time. Run files when they finish with just a click! When a download finishes, GetRight will show a window like the one here. You can simply click as it says to open the file.\n\n    And GetRight&amp;#039;s history will help you find your files too. A list will show all your recently completed downloads. You can use the built-in filters to see downloads finished today, yesterday, the past week, etc. Or choose one of the file type filters if you know you&amp;#039;re looking for a program, video, etc!\n\nHave a Modem?\n    If you do, you surely have already experienced the biggest problem...you are downloading a file, and your modem gets disconnected, or call waiting interrupts, or your computer crashes, or any number of other problems. Then you have to restart the download from the very beginning, losing all the time you had already spent.\n\n    GetRight solves this problem by allowing you to resume a download. If you got part of the file before the problem, GetRight will restart the download in the middle so it only gets the rest of the file, without having to restart from the beginning. This makes downloading your files much easier and faster.\n\n    You can resume as many times as needed to get the file. Doing that 1800 MB demo shown above would take days using a modem, but you could spread it out over a week--even doing all downloading at night while you sleep!\n    Read more about resuming downloads and saving broken connections.\n\nHave a fast connection (DSL/cable/etc)?\n    Even Better! You may have fewer broken downloads, but all the other features will be even more useful for you. GetRight&amp;#039;s acceleration features can make a big improvement in your download speeds--GetRight can split up a file and download several pieces at the same time, which can really help get the most speed out of your fast connection.\n\n    And when you do have any disconnections (which always seem to wait until you&amp;#039;re downloading that BIG file) GetRight will be there and ready to resume when you need it!\n\n    That fast connection can let you download lots of files, so you&amp;#039;re even more likely to lose something; GetRight will help you find it.\n    Read more about accelerating downloads. \n\n\nFeatures for Everybody.\nGetRight has many more features.\n\n    * GetRight can download not only from web and ftp servers, but also BitTorrent? downloads.\n    * It integrates with your web browser, so using GetRight is as easy as clicking.
