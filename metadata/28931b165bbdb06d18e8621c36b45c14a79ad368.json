Frank meets a charismatic young woman who enters the club. It takes him a moment to recognise her as Tiril, his son's pre-school teacher. Smitten, Frank approaches her and they strike a tone. After a few drinks, they leave together and spend the night at Frank's place. Meanwhile, Thomas Aune and Zlatan arrive in New York. They're escorted by a distant relative of Zlatan named Dino, who takes them to a known hangout for DeLucci's men.\n\nFrom Norway, in Norwegian\n\nSubtitles by SBS AU TV\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28931b165bbdb06d18e8621c36b45c14a79ad368","amp;dn":"Lilyhammer+S2+Ep7+-+The+Freezer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28931b165bbdb06d18e8621c36b45c14a79ad368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,147,27,22,91,189,176,109,24,232,98,28,54,180,92,20,167,154,211,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
