Since then, Nullsoft sold Winamp to AOL (the parent company of TechCrunch) for $80 million and online music has changed quite a bit, but there was always something reassuring about the fact that Winamp was still hanging in there. So much for that. Winamp is shutting down. The website and all of WinampÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s web services will shut down on December 20 and the desktop player will no longer be available for download.\n\nEven if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember Winamp, you may remember the demo MP3 that played when you installed the app: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Winamp, it really whips the llamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ass.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nwinampIn an interview with Ars Technica last year, Rob Lord, the first hire at Nullsoft and the first general manager of Winamp said that he believed that Ã¢â‚¬Å“thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no reason that Winamp couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be in the position that iTunes is in today if not for a few layers of mismanagement by AOL that started immediately upon acquisition.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhile AOL kept Winamp going Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it released an Android version in 2010 and Winamp Sync for Mac, including a full player, launched in 2011 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there was never a clear sense of what was going on with the product. The Winamp blog, however, hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been updated for the last year and judging from ArsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ portrait of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fortunes from 2012, it seems like AOL never quite knew what to do with it.\n\nIf you still want a copy of Winamp, now is the time to download it and to import those MP3s you downloaded from Napster back in 1999 into it.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThese are the system requirements for Winamp:\n\nMinimum\n\n500MHz Pentium III or comparable\n128MB RAM\n15MB Hard Disk Space\n16bit Sound Card\nWindows XP or later\nInternet Explorer 5.01 or higher (for Online Services)\n1x speed or greater CD Burner (Required for Burning)\n2x speed or greater CDROM (Required for Ripping)\n\nRecommended\n\n1.5 GHz Pentium IV or comparable\n512MB RAM or greater\n30MB Hard Disk Space\n24bit Sound Card\nWindows XP sp3, or later\nInternet Explorer 6.0 or higher (for all Online Services features)\n8x speed or greater CD Burner (Required for Burning)\n16x speed or greater CDROM (Required for Ripping)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7356317f36db88c0f700c428c654548d70952aa","amp;dn":"Winamp+Media+Player+5.66+%5BEN-US%5D+-+latest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7356317f36db88c0f700c428c654548d70952aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,53,99,23,243,109,184,140,15,112,12,66,140,101,69,72,215,9,82,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
