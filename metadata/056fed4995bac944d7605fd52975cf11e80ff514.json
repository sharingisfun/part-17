As victims awaken from a coma, they now have the basic need to attack loved ones, to spread the infection, and to feed on warm flesh. Only rage remains. In days, the dead outnumber the living, and the US turns to the ultimate weapons to stop the infection.\n\nIn a world filled with zombies, survivors find that the living can be far more inhumane and cruel than anything they have ever imagined, as raiders scavenge for supplies and lawlessness and hatred are the norm. Both outlaws and zombies crave meat. In this time of hopelessness and horror, a bullet to the brain may be the kindest action.\n\nGeorge, an older, retired police officer, sets his own terms: fight and survive or go the way you want, but donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let the zombies win. He explains that everyone is responsible for his own fate, and if that means going out on unpopular terms, then so be it. Len, a retired Marine; a quiet cowboy, Kim; a hot-tempered Hispanic woman, Julia; and a compassionate young woman, Beth all begin their terrorizing journey, not only to survive, but also to establish a new society, find love and joy in a barren, bloody landscape, and to face gathering enemies.\n\n \n01.
