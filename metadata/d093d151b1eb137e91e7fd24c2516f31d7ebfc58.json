I bought it, and encourage you to do it if you enjoy it even half as much as I did. Could not put the thing down. \n\nI did not edit the converted formats, but hopefully there are no errors. The mobi is the original (un-drmed).\n\nSummary\nThirty years ago, in a facility buried beneath a vast Wyoming emptiness, an experiment gone awry accidentally opened a door.\n\nIt is the world's best-kept secretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and its most terrifying.\n\nTrying to regain his life in the Alaskan wilds, ex-con/ex-cop Travis Chase stumbles upon an impossible scene: a crashed 747 passenger jet filled with the murdered dead, including the wife of the President of the United States. Though a nightmare of monumental proportions, it pales before the terror to come, as Chase is dragged into a battle for the future that revolves around an amazing artifact.\n\nAllied with a beautiful covert operative whose life he saved, Chase must now play the role he's been destined forÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a pawn of incomprehensible forces or humankind's final hopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as the race toward Apocalypse begins in earnest.\n\nBecause something is loose in the world.\n\nAnd doomsday is not only possible . . . it is inevitable.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d093d151b1eb137e91e7fd24c2516f31d7ebfc58","amp;dn":"The+Breach+by+Patrick+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d093d151b1eb137e91e7fd24c2516f31d7ebfc58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,147,209,81,177,235,19,126,145,231,253,36,194,81,111,49,215,235,252,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
