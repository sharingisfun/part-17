This case-study approachÃ¢â‚¬â€based on years of immersion in the killers' diaries, confessions, psychiatric interviews, statements to the press, videotapes, and photographsÃ¢â‚¬â€ led the way in defining serial and mass murders not as the acts of alien creatures with deranged minds but rather as personalized protests by alienated men against the society that they believe has excluded them. Leyton also provides an analysis of the Washington, D.C. sniper case. While uncovering the central themes of modern culture that motivated their deeds, Leyton provides vivid and chilling portraits of Edmund Kemper, Ted Bundy, Albert DeSalvo, and David Berkowitz, serial murderers whose prolonged killing campaigns provided them revenge against the world and celebrity careers; and other mass murderers whose brief but horrific murder sprees constituted their own enigmatic suicide notes. The author shows that the motives of multiple murderers are not simply sexual or psychotic; but rise from the very core of American mass culture.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dab43a45b0b7dee9bd5882c077dc4bad6aef86a","amp;dn":"Hunting+Humans+The+Rise+of+the+Modern+Multiple+Murderer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dab43a45b0b7dee9bd5882c077dc4bad6aef86a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,171,67,164,91,11,125,238,155,213,136,44,7,125,196,186,214,174,248,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
