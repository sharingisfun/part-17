At least that's how writer and newlywed John comes to describe his blonde lab, Marley, when he takes the puppy home and finds that the fluff-ball has an uncanny ability to eat and/or destroy just about anything. As years go by, John and his wife, Jennifer, contemplate having babies and moving across the country, while Marley grows into 100 lbs. of funny, wild, completely untrainable canine companionship -- as well as one of the most important people in the family. Marley &amp; Me is based on the best-selling autobiographical book by columnist John Grogan. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\nTheatrical Feature Running Time: 115 mins \nComplete Cast:\nOwen Wilson - John Grogan\nEric Dane - Sebastian\nKathleen Turner - Mrs. Kornblut\nHaley Bennett - Lisa\nClarke Peters - Editor\nLucy Merriam - Colleen (Age 5)\nBen Hyland - Conor (Age 5)\nJennifer Aniston - Jenny Grogan\nAlan Arkin - Arnie Klein\nNathan Gamble - Patrick (Age 10)\nAnn Dowd - Dr. Platt\nFinley Jacobsen - Conor (Age 8)\nBryce Robinson - Patrick (Age 7)\n\n\nDirector(s):David Frankel\nWriter(s):Scott Frank, Don Roos\nProducer(s):Karen Rosenfelt, Gil Netter\nTheatrical MPAA Rating: PG(Adult Situations, Mild Language)\nCategories:Comedy\n\nFormat: DVD\nRelease Date: 03/31/2009\nMPAA Rating: PG\nRunning Time: 115 min\nNumber of Discs: 1\nLanguage: Eng/Spa/Fre\nSubTitles: Eng/Spa\n\nBlockbuster info link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.blockbuster.com/browse/catalog/movieDetails/367201&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.blockbuster.com/browse/catalog/movieDetails/367201&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy and Seed!\nThis is an EvilTSAngel Original DVDRip!\nMenu's and Extra's included!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2955cac985b47c54310db67fe13722170b7e97bf","amp;dn":"Marley+and+Me+-+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2955cac985b47c54310db67fe13722170b7e97bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,85,202,201,133,180,124,84,49,13,182,127,225,55,34,23,11,126,151,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
