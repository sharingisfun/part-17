Since this is a document which according to many readers is of of great historical value, I humbly ask all owners of images used for their permission. I deeply thank you for your contribution in solving one of the world's greatest murder mysteries. \n\nlightonconspiracies.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1c53a48a3d5ab057b0fa24300b29955f91d716f","amp;dn":"Coup+d%27%26eacute%3Btat+in+slow+motion%2C+by+Ole+Dammegard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1c53a48a3d5ab057b0fa24300b29955f91d716f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,197,58,72,163,213,171,5,123,15,162,67,0,178,153,85,249,29,113,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
