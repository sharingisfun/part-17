CD\n\nTwo classic, late-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s albums from Jerry Reed, both of them never on CD before! The titles to these two records (his first two) really tell the tale; Jerry was an unbelievable guitarist and singer, and you can add songwriter to the listÃ¢â‚¬â€at least Elvis thought so, as he covered both Ã¢â‚¬Å“Guitar ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“U.S. MaleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from Unbelievable (and hired Jerry to play guitar on both)! Jerry returned the favor by writing an Elvis tribute song (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tupelo Mississippi FlashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) on 1968Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Nashville Underground, which lives up to its title by presenting a revelatory blend of country, rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll, folk, blue-eyed soul and even progressive pop. Though Reed was a protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of Chet Atkins, his eclectic taste and irrepressible personalityÃ¢â‚¬â€later on full display in the Smokey and the Bandit filmsÃ¢â‚¬â€ensured that this record busted out of the countrypolitan mold that held sway in Nashville at the time. Both of these albums are must-listens for any alt-country and roots music fan, and Chris Morris contributes notes that place these two albums in context of JerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible (and, to this day, underappreciated) career.\n\nSongs:\n\nIt DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Work That Way\n\nGuitar Man\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Young and YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll Forget\n\nWoman Shy\n\nI Feel for You\n\nTake a Walk\n\nLove Man\n\nIf I Promise\n\nU.S. Male\n\nLong Gone\n\nIf It Comes to That\n\nThe Claw\n\nRemembering\n\nA Thing Called Love\n\nYou WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Know a Good Thing\n\nSave Your Dreams\n\nAlmost Crazy\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Been CryinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Again\n\nFine on My Mind\n\nTupelo Mississippi Flash\n\nWabash Cannonball\n\nHallelujah, I Love Her So\n\nJohn Henry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb77a324e5d2db765b87895d8ff4b90ee6075bc0","amp;dn":"Jerry+Reed+Unbelievable+Guitar+%26amp%3BVoice%2FNashville+Underground","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb77a324e5d2db765b87895d8ff4b90ee6075bc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,119,163,36,229,210,219,118,91,135,137,93,143,244,185,14,230,7,91,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
