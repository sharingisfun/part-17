Crazy you say? This booklet will open your eyes to the possibility and logical conclusion of the matter as the most feared and least understood agency operating under the banner of the U.S. Government is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). One of their activities is collecting income taxes - another is targeting anyone who speaks out against corruption by government officials or those who, working behind the scenes, control the government. If the American taxpayers ever discover that the Internal Revenue Service operates on 90% bluff, the entire income tax system will collapse. If it is necessary for the IRS to bluff people into paying income taxes, then it is a good indication that something is radically wrong with the IRS and the income tax which it collects. There are many things wrong with the whole income tax scenario, and the whole thing would collapse if enough Americans should find out about it. Find out what the bluff is all about. 35 pages. A must read for everyone.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbd1db16ca5364d00b05673e0041b89962bb0a0c","amp;dn":"Martin-How+to+Save+100%25+on+Your+Income+Tax%28expose+of+IRS+bluff%29%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbd1db16ca5364d00b05673e0041b89962bb0a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,209,219,22,202,83,100,208,11,5,103,62,0,65,184,153,98,187,10,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
