Still photographer Stern sidesteps more formal documentary conventions such as narrative voiceovers to wander purposefully from festival stage to boarding-house jam sessions, taking in the parallel color and motion of the Americas Cup preparations when he isnt capturing rich color footage of the performances and the celebratory mood of the concertgoers. In the process, he documents American jazz at a notably golden moment in its development--diverse, adventurous, and still broadly popular, this was jazz not yet under the shadow of rock and youth culture, played by an integrated artistic community a few short years away from social and political turmoil that would boil divisively to the surface during the 60s. To say Stern was rolling film in a jazz Camelot is overstatement, but only slightly so.\nSterns circular approach and wonderful eye achieve a breezy languor at the expense of more comprehensive coverage of the festivals bumper crop of strong jazz, blues, and gospel musicians. Perhaps inevitably, the camera lingers on Louis Armstrong, Anita O Day, Mahalia Jackson, Dinah Washington, Thelonious Monk, Gerry Mulligan, and George Shearing. Avid fans of later styles may be frustrated by the fleeting glimpses of other musicians such as Eric Dolphy and Art Farmer, or the honor roll of classic jazz stylists whose Newport sets werent included in the film, but such omissions seem forgivable, if not necessary, to Sterns serendipitous design. --Sam Sutherland \n\n\nArtists:\nJimmy Giuffre\nThelonious Monk\nHenry Grimes\nSonny Stitt\nSal Salvador\nAnita O Day \nGeorge Shearing\nDinah Washington\nGerry Mulligan\nBig Maybelle\nChuck Berry\nChico Hamilton\nLouis Armstrong\nJack Teagarden\nMahalia Jack\n\nSize: 1198.93 Mb ( 1 257 166 848 bytes )\nPlay length: 01:21:32.809 (117310 frames)\nSubtitles: Not Present\nVideo: 640x472 (1.36:1), 23.976 fps, XviD MPEG-4 ~1662 kbps avg, 0.23 bit/pixel\nAudio: 48 kHz, AC3 Dolby Digital, 3/2 (L,C,R,l,r) + LFE ch, ~384.00 kbps avg\nNo need subtitles\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54261ffe9ec6194776bee1d0291e2449ba80391d","amp;dn":"Jazz+on+a+Summers+Day+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54261ffe9ec6194776bee1d0291e2449ba80391d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,38,31,254,158,198,25,71,118,190,225,208,41,30,36,73,186,128,57,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
