And yes,\nhe sings in Portuguese.\n_____\n\n&quot;It&amp;#039;s about time a band put the rock back in post-rock. All those massive\nbuildups are fine and dandy, but the final peak just isn&amp;#039;t what it could be\nanymore. It&amp;#039;s not churning my guts any longer. Thankfully, Portugal&amp;#039;s own Linda\nMartini has been thinking the exact same thing and seemingly formed just to\nbring that passion back to this most emotional of genres. A few closed-minded\nlisteners would probably be very quick to point out just how not post-rock Linda\nMartini is. But their whole-hearted, endearing love of distortion, crunch, and\nthe ever-present buildup shows that they very easily could be put in the same\ngenre as Explosions in the Sky or Godspeed! You Black Emperor, even if their\nsonic similarities are more Oceansize, Failure, or My Bloody Valentine.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s been a long time since a band has grabbed me as firmly in the first five\nminutes as Linda Martini has. Even when they start to border on predictable in\ntheir transitions, there&amp;#039;s always some change to the thought process that makes\ntheir sound intriguing. During the build-up in &quot;Amor Combate,&quot; the experienced\npost-rock listener can instinctively figure out just where the sudden explosion\nwill come. They might even know exactly how it will start. However, Linda\nMartini knows what would be expected and gives you half of the puzzle you\nthought you had figured out. Just when you think the transition will come, it\ndoes. But drummer H. Morais decides to get ultra-creative with the drumming,\ndelaying the sudden guitar charge by a few seconds. If you weren&amp;#039;t hooked\nalready, you are now.\n\nOf course, there&amp;#039;s another case the band has against being post-rock. Vocals.\nAnd lots of them. In Portuguese. Fine, you know what? Maybe they&amp;#039;re not\npost-rock. Maybe they&amp;#039;re just amazing. Is that so bad, really, in the grand\nscheme of this thing we call music? It&amp;#039;s safe to say that &quot;amazing&quot; would be a\npretty high compliment. It&amp;#039;s definitely not an insult. And as the band closes\nthis EP out with swirling, unapologetic distortion, you can&amp;#039;t help but find\nsolace in the few moments of melody found in the underlying and overlapping\nlayers.\n\nLinda Martini is the band to watch in 2006, plain and simple. To even begin to\ncomprehend that this is what happened on their very first try is a monumental\ntask. If and when they release a full album, track it down. If the import price\ntag is forty bucks, buy it. You won&amp;#039;t be disappointed. This is all you could ask\nfor in a debut or even a third or fourth effort. Marvelous.&quot;\n(review from the 1st EP in http://www.decoymusic.com/vb/showthread.php?t=11816)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/lindamartini&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/lindamartini&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4728e904dc198b5b44c98975dccb77b5197e4dcd","amp;dn":"Linda+Martini+-+Olhos+de+Mongol+-+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4728e904dc198b5b44c98975dccb77b5197e4dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,40,233,4,220,25,139,91,68,201,137,117,220,203,119,181,25,126,77,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
