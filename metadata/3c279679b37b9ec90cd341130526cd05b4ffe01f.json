Letterman designed the first battlefield evacuation system after an unprepared medical corps at Bull Run left thousands of soldiers to die in the place where they were wounded. We also learn about Wheeler Lipes, a young navy corpsman and submariner with minimal medical training who on September 11, 1942, conducted the first-ever appendectomy at sea. And, we hear the story of Pfc. Monica Brown, the young army medic who was awarded the Silver Star for rescuing fellow soldiers from a disabled Humvee during an ambush in the Paktika province of Eastern Afghanistan in 2007. Brown is only the second woman in sixty years to receive the prestigious award. Through these stories and many others, McGaugh traces the captivating evolution of battlefield care, from the Revolutionary War to today's battles in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBattlefield Angels captures &quot;in-the-trenches moments&quot; during which medics and corpsmen fought to save the lives of their comrades.  Along the way, readers will learn the fascinating history of battlefield medicine and how it has benefited both military and civilian medical practice throughout American history. McGaugh also looks ahead to the future, where telemedicine and robotic surgery promise to transform the battlefield once again. In the end, Battlefield Angels both chronicles and pays homage to the men and women in arms who fight every day to save the lives of their fellow soldiers, sailors, and marines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c279679b37b9ec90cd341130526cd05b4ffe01f","amp;dn":"Battlefield+Angels%3A+Saving+Lives+Under+Enemy+Fire+From+Valley+Fo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c279679b37b9ec90cd341130526cd05b4ffe01f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,39,150,121,179,123,158,201,12,211,65,19,5,38,205,5,180,255,224,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
