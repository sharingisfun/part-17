Productions in 2010 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nNazi Collaborators \nThis series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. &quot;How could they have done it?&quot; How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. At the heart of this 13 part series lies one uneasy question. If you had faced what these people had faced, might you have done the same thing - and danced with the devil? \n\n5)  Croation Collaborator \nIn 1941, when German tanks rolled into Yugoslavia in the second year of World War Two, it should have been a tragedy. However for many of the country's Croats it was seen as something else. It was an opportunity to break away from Yugoslav rule and set up the first ever independent Croat State. As the war unfolded, Croatia became a nation of Nazi collaborators. One of the most enthusiastic was Dinko Sakic. He ran one of the most brutal and notorious death camps of World War Two. Some 80,000 people were killed in the name of a free Croatia.It was known as the Auschwitz of the Balkans. Sakic survived the war by fleeing to Argentina before he could be brought to trial in Europe. He lived a long and peaceful life until he made a serious error of judgement in the late 90's. Believing he was no longer a wanted man he bizarrely agreed to be interviewed by Argentinian TV.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1915 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 52.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11f9a37f06689e3418fd8f0599302b168af97396","amp;dn":"Nazi+Collaborators+05of13+Croation+Collaborator+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11f9a37f06689e3418fd8f0599302b168af97396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,249,163,127,6,104,158,52,24,253,143,5,153,48,43,22,138,249,115,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
