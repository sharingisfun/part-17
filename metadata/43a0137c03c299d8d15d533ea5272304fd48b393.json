They recorded numerous singles and albums and achieved vast regional popularity, but only scored one modest national hit, &quot;Baja.&quot; With little material of their own, they judiciously tapped heavyweights like Lee Hazelwood (who wrote &quot;Baja&quot;), Roger Christian, and Gary Usher, as well as covering tunes by Dick Dale and Henry Mancini. The group shone brightest on their instrumentals, which used mounds of Fender reverb and two rhythm guitars; when they sang, the results were much less successful.\n\nTaken From: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:h9fqxqr5ldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:h9fqxqr5ldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nCollectables Go Go Go/For You From Us collects two albums the Astronauts released in 1965 on one single disc. Go Go Go is a weird collection, containing rock &amp; roll (&quot;Almost Grown&quot;), exotica (&quot;Quiet Village&quot;), blues, folk and originals, none of which is particularly impressive. For You From Us is a better record, containing solid versions of &quot;Mary Lou,&quot; &quot;Baby What You Want Me to Do,&quot; &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; &quot;Unchain My Heart,&quot; &quot;Crawfish Song,&quot; &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot; and &quot;Reelin' and Rockin'.&quot; Still, this disc is something that only hardcore surf-rock fans will find of interest.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:09fwxqyjldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:09fwxqyjldae&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEntries for the individual albums exist, but they lack reviews:\n\nGo...Go...Go!!!: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gpftxq85ld0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gpftxq85ld0e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor You From Us: &lt;a href=&quot; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:abfpxq90ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:abfpxq90ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
