With Beck's blistering blues riffs and Stewartsgravelly hobo voice, this is where the SuperGroups first started. Originally issued as twoseperate albums, Truth and Beckola are brought together here on one CD, and this is a mustfor any serious rock music fan. Admittedly, the sound lacks the dynamism and performanceof, say Led Zepplin, but easily makes up for this in the musicianship, vocals and, not least,the songs. The first album to be released, Truth, features some classic blues rock songs suchas I ain't Superstitious and Rock My Plimsoul, whilst at the same time effortlessly slipping intothe more soulful Greensleeves and Ol' Man River. Sound dymanics and contrast are animportant and oft overlooked ingrediant in the best of heavy rock. The arrangements, here,however, are full of light and dark corners and shade. This is a classic album which redefinedrock music in the mid/late sixties. Beckola, on the other hand, goes one step further andoffers something genuinely innovative and as such can be viewed as a landmark album from1969. Nicky Hopkins joined the group on keyboards and Rod Stewart was at his zenith as ablues singer and Jeff Beck was rapidly developing into a serious heavy blues guitarist.Whatever music Beck had made before was only leading up to this beathtaking album. Theaccent, as the sleeve notes explain, is on heavy music. And it doesn't come any heavier thanthis. Plynth, Hangman's Knee and Rice Pudding are all intelligently arranged songs, avoidingthe crash bang wallop school of heavy rock, prefering instead an air of control and suspense.Historically important as these two albums are, they are still as exciting and fresh as the daythey were released\n\n\n\n\n   1.
