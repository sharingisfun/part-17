It cannot simply be dubbed a &quot;side&quot; project, since the band has Grammy nominations and gold records under their belts and are so much more than an offshoot they work on in their spare time when Slipknot goes on hiatus. Stone Sour also have an array of hit singles, to boot, from previous albums in the form of &quot;Bother&quot; and &quot;Through Glass&quot; while Audio Secrecy's &quot;Say You'll Haunt Me&quot; is propelling the band at this current moment.\n\nThe band is adept at melding melodic and metallic, and they sure inflict their share of sonic bruises with &quot;Mission Statement,&quot; &quot;LetÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s Be Honest&quot; and &quot;Digital (Did You Tell.)&quot; Audio Secrecy is the most polished Stone Sour record of the three, but none of the edges have been dulled or blunted; Taylor is too intense ever be muted and his cast of players gel to form an ironclad musical curtain.\n\nTake a listen to &quot;Unfinished&quot; if you want to know what a Stone Sour punch in the face feels like. While many Slipknot worshipping maggots wonder why Taylor and Root go the Stone Sour route, it's simple; Stone Sour is an outlet for them to do their thing and to do something else, which is a noble and beautiful pursuit for a musician. Sure, Stone Sour are more traditional than their main outlet, yet the music is still heavy enough to scare the little kid next door. The songwriting is tight and memorable and a bit cleaner, which helps elevate the band a notch above their peers. Stone Sour's closest relatives with Audio Secrecy are Stone Temple Pilots and Disturbed, as all three bands have masterfully learned how to pit bone-shattering riffs alongside unforgettable choruses. That is not as easy at is sounds.
