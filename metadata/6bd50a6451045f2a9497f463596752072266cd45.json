Flight radar 24 has a rapidly growing network of several thousand ground stations around the world to receive this data that then shows up as aircraft moving on a map in the app. In an expanding number of regions Flightradar24, with the help of multilateration, is able to calculate the positions of aircraft that donâ€™t have ADS-B transponders.\r\n\r\nTraditional radar data is also used in the app thanks to a direct feed from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This data provides near real-time coverage of all US and Canadian airspace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd50a6451045f2a9497f463596752072266cd45","amp;dn":"Flightradar24+6.5.0+%28ipa%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd50a6451045f2a9497f463596752072266cd45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,213,10,100,81,4,95,42,148,151,244,99,89,103,82,7,34,102,205,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
