The visual tone poem contains neither dialogue nor a vocalized narration: its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music. Reggio explains the lack of dialogue by stating &quot;it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live.&quot; In the Hopi language, the word Koyaanisqatsi means &quot;crazy life, life in turmoil, life out of balance, life disintegrating, a state of life that calls for another way of living&quot;. The film is the first in the Qatsi trilogy of films: it is followed by Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002). The trilogy depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans, nature, and technology. Koyaanisqatsi is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a cult film. However, because of copyright issues, the film was out of print for most of the 1990s.\n\nName: Koyaaniskatsi \nOriginal title: Koyaanisqatsi: Life Out of Balance \nReleased: 1982 \nGenre: Documentary, Music \nDirector: Godfrey Reggio \nComposer: Philip Glass, Michael Hoenig \nStarring: Ted Koppel \n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat: .
