After decades of rising, China has entered a new and critical phase where it seeks to turn its economic heft into global power. In this deeply informed book, Geoff Dyer makes a lucid and convincing argument that China and the United States are now embarking on a great power--style competition that will dominate the century. This contest will take place in every arena: from control of the seas, where China's new navy is trying to ease the United States out of Asia and reassert its traditional leadership, to rewriting the rules of the global economy, with attempts to turn the renminbi into the predominant international currency, toppling the dominance of the U.S. dollar. And by investing billions to send its media groups overseas, Beijing hopes to shift the global debate about democracy and individual rights. Eyeing the high ground of international politics, China is taking the first steps in an ambitious global agenda.\n\n Yet Dyer explains how China will struggle to unseat the United States. China's new ambitions are provoking intense anxiety, especially in Asia, while America's global influence has deep roots. If Washington can adjust to a world in which it is no longer dominant but still immensely powerful, it can withstand China's challenge. With keen insight based on a deep local knowledge--offering the reader visions of coastal Chinese beauty pageants and secret submarine bases, lockstep Beijing military parades and the neon media screens of Xinhua exported to New York City's Times Square--The Contest of the Century is essential reading at a time of great uncertainty about America's future, a road map for retaining a central role in the world.\n\n\nepub","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8276a248bf088f29ee307d415a1f7f831665f1","amp;dn":"The+Contest+of+the+Century%3A+Era+of+Competition+with+China%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8276a248bf088f29ee307d415a1f7f831665f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,130,118,162,72,191,8,143,41,238,48,125,65,90,31,127,131,22,101,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
