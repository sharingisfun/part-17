These 1960s series were full of Allen's favorite tricks, techniques and characteristic touches, and influenced other productions from the original Star Trek forward. Every science-fiction show owes something to Allen, yet none has equaled his series' pace, excitement, or originality. This detailed examination and documentation of the premise and origin of the four shows offers an objective evaluation of every episode--and demonstrates that when Irwin Allen's television episodes were good, they were great, and when they were bad, they were still terrific fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3580fc5144f2af21bc1fa229ae93ee58bad9ed","amp;dn":"Irwin+Allen+Television+Productions%2C+1964+-1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3580fc5144f2af21bc1fa229ae93ee58bad9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,53,128,252,81,68,242,175,33,188,31,162,41,174,147,238,88,186,217,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
