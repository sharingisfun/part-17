It was Gillan's last album before his second comeback with Deep Purple in August 1992. The subsequent mammoth 10-month tour, which crossed Europe and South America, proved Ian Gillan to be a strong live attraction. Although Toolbox wasn't a big commercial success it is considered by many as one of Gillan's finest records. In the USA the album was first released in 1997.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP2]\n\n01. \t&quot;Hang Me Out to Dry&quot;   \tIan Gillan, Leslie West \t4:03\n02. \t&quot;Toolbox&quot;   \t  \t4:15\n03. \t&quot;Dirty Dog&quot;   \t  \t4:07\n04. \t&quot;Candy Horizon&quot;   \t  \t4:17\n05. \t&quot;Don't Hold Me Back&quot;   \t  \t4:37\n06. \t&quot;Pictures of Hell&quot;   \t  \t3:56\n07. \t&quot;Dancing Nylon Shirt (Part 1)&quot;   \t  \t3:39\n08. \t&quot;Bed of Nails&quot;   \t  \t4:25\n09. \t&quot;Gassed Up&quot;   \t  \t3:05\n10. \t&quot;Everything I Need&quot;   \t  \t3:50\n11. \t&quot;Dancing Nylon Shirt (Part 2)&quot;   \t  \t3:02","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c1fa1cf69f4f1dad161c27fbc8a1c963fff62b","amp;dn":"Ian+Gillan+-+Toolbox+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c1fa1cf69f4f1dad161c27fbc8a1c963fff62b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,193,250,28,246,159,79,29,173,22,28,39,251,200,161,201,99,255,246,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
