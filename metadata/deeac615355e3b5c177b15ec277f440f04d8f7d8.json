He claims that I &quot;continues to fool people&quot; with &quot;poor, inaccurate releases&quot;. His comments can be read here: http://www.demonoid.ph/files/details/3004144/22331144/\nIf you feel his criticism is fair, then don't download this. It is not for you. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\nFor those of you that may be interested in comparing the EV4 decoding capabilities of the QS-D1000 versus OxfordDickie's own conversion method, I have included four 4.0 flac sample files. Two EV4 tracks decoded by OxfordDickie (available on his private blog), and the same two tracks decoded by the QS-D1000. Compare, listen and judge for yourselves. If after listening to these tracks you feel the QS-D1000 does an unacceptable job of decoding EV4 then don't download any of my future DY/EV4 releases. Again, you have been warned.\n\n\n&quot;They can't have much faith in the new one if they're loss-leading with an old one (the one that turned them into a cult band, now finally--how did we stand the wait?--available in its pristine mono form). And indeed, there's no reason they should. Despite the title, it's not some sort of primitive surf doowop--sounds a lot like Friends and Holland to me. Fairly pleasant, but even the highlights aren't all that hot: a nice Brian Wilson oeuvre called &quot;Marcella&quot; (sounds like Smiley Smile) and a silly gospel song for the Maharishi.&quot; C+\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deeac615355e3b5c177b15ec277f440f04d8f7d8","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+Carl+and+the+Passions+%26quot%3BSo+Tough%26quot%3B+%28197","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deeac615355e3b5c177b15ec277f440f04d8f7d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,234,198,21,53,94,59,92,23,123,21,236,39,127,68,15,4,216,247,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
