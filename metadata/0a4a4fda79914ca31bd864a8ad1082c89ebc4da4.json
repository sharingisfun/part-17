The band was initially composed of keyboardist/lead vocalist, Bryan Duncan, and brothers Kevin (bass guitar) and Rick (drums/vocals) Thomson. The band was the brainchild of the Thomson brothers. Randy Thomas, guitarist/vocalist joined the group about 2 years later. After their second album, SCB also became well known for their highly detailed, airbrushed album cover art by Kernie Erickson, a trend that had previously been considered too costly for Christian groups who did not produce the high-volume album sales of mainstream bands such as Kansas. The SCB logo was created by Rick Griffin.\n\nSweet Comfort Band was a late entry into Jesus music with their 1977 self-titled release on Maranatha! Records. When they started, they had a funky, jazzy, R&amp;B and 70's rock sound. This set them apart from many of the bands in the nascent Contemporary Christian music industry who were primarily performing folk-rock and soft rock. Few bands had the musicianship displayed by this quartet. However, Maranatha! decided to quit releasing rock and roll albums and focus on children's releases, gospel and worship music. The band did not fit the new direction, so Light Records welcomed them for their sophomore release Breakin' The Ice. The next six years saw them touring heavily to support their releases and the band drifted towards a more traditional radio-rock sound. Keyboard-Wizard John Andrew Schreiner was added as a supplemental musician during their tours in later years, as Duncan took more of a vocal-heavy, lead frontman role on stage and away from performing integrated keyboard parts.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - May 2012\n\nPlease continue to share with others, what was shared with you today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4a4fda79914ca31bd864a8ad1082c89ebc4da4","amp;dn":"Sweet+Comfort+Band+Discography+1977-2003+%288+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4a4fda79914ca31bd864a8ad1082c89ebc4da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,74,79,218,121,145,76,163,27,216,100,168,173,16,130,200,158,188,77,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
