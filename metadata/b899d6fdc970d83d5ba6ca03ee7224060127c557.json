The big difference, is that while there are many paths/choices you can make, there is only one ending (The End), and you have to make all the right choices to get to it.\n\nSome personal notes regarding #4 Star System Tenopia; While I was scanning in this book.  I put too much pressure on the spine, trying to flatten it out for a good scan... chunks of the pages separated from the spine of this book, and there are a few pages where you can see the pages coming apart in the scan. I still did the best I could scanning in the entire book, but a few of the pages in this look funky (you can still read it just fine).  This book itself is nearly 28 years old...\n\nHere's all the Escape from Tenopia books:\n#1 Tenopia Island, by Edward Packard\n#2 Trapped in the Sea Kingdom, by Richard Brightfield\n#3 Terror on Kabran, by Richard Brightfield\n#4 Star System Tenopia by Richard Brightfield\t\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b899d6fdc970d83d5ba6ca03ee7224060127c557","amp;dn":"Escape+from+Tenopia+Bookography-Choose+Your+Own+Adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b899d6fdc970d83d5ba6ca03ee7224060127c557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,153,214,253,201,112,216,61,91,166,202,3,238,114,36,6,1,39,197,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
