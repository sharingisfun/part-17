The box set was released by 20th Century Fox on December 2, 2003 following the re-release of Alien in theaters on Halloween 2003. \n\n\n\nEach of the four movies has two discs. Each film has been remastered for this release, presented in its original aspect ratio, and remixed with Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 audio (Alien and Alien: Resurrection only). There is also a 24-page companion booklet giving information on the films, its plot and the bonus features. Each film is separately available in a two-disc set aside from the box set.\n\n\n\nCreated by DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika, the &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot; box set went on to win numerous awards, including the DVD Exclusive Award for Best Classic Movie (including all extras) and Best Audio Commentary for Alien, as well as landing on several top ten DVD lists.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, for the 25th anniversary, the Alien Quadrilogy was re-released in Alien-head packaging, with the DVDs stored inside the head.\n\n \n\nThe term &quot;Quadrilogy&quot; was in fact a mistake on the part of Fox marketing, but has become something of a neologism. Tetralogy is the more accepted term\n\n\n\n\n\n# more at     &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.moviecitygeek.com/dvd/2003/alien_quad.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.moviecitygeek.com/dvd/2003/alien_quad.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n# I provide ( Ro sub ) for all 4 movies  \n\n\n# http://tracker.filiasi.ro/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d7f09f8f3edec00ed1f905f9328648937fba40c","amp;dn":"The+Alien+Quadrilogy+DvDRiP+%28Alien%2C+Aliens%2C+Alien+3+and+Alien%3A+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d7f09f8f3edec00ed1f905f9328648937fba40c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,127,9,248,243,237,236,0,237,31,144,95,147,40,100,137,55,251,164,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
