US President John F Kennedy is assassinated as his motorcade passes through the cityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s streets. The assassin is soon captured, and revealed to be disaffected Communist sympathizer Lee Harvey Oswald. Did Oswald act alone, or did he have help? Is the Bilderberg Group simply a group of international financiers concerned with promoting democracy throughout the world, or is there a more sinister power at work? And what really happened to Princess DianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Mercedes one warm August nigh in a Paris underpass?\n\n\nConspiracy looks at a range of the most interesting theories of this nature, from the risibly far-fetched, such as the belief that the world is run by the lizard people, to the only-too-true and tragic such as the overthrow and murder of Chilean President Salvador Allende.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485e2cf9219a32c10fe60ccd50e310236afcf742","amp;dn":"Conspiracy%3A+History%27s+Greatest+Plots%2C+Collusions+and+Cover+Ups+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485e2cf9219a32c10fe60ccd50e310236afcf742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,94,44,249,33,154,50,193,15,230,12,205,80,227,16,35,106,252,247,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
