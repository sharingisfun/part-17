Downhill. No brakes.\n\nChet Griffin, San Francisco's fastest rollerblading messenger, was given a simple assignment. But that delivery turned real deadly, real fast. Seems the package he was carrying contained a single computer disk-- worth a cool billion. \n\nOn a routine run, one of Chet's co-workers gets murdered, the fingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pointed at Chet, and he finds himself running for his life. Chet enlists the help of his skaterchick bisexual buddy and his superhacker roommate, and takes off across the city to track down the evidence he needs to bring down a financial Ponzi scheme that uncannily foretells our current crisis.\n\nOn a wild ride through SF's sloping streets and the twisted channels of cyberspace, Joe Quirk delivers a hip, sexy game of cat-and-mousepad that will leave you breathless.\n\nThis retro classic takes place in the nineties, before cell phones and ipods, when Google was still called BackRub, and beepers were cool.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Exciting Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ a witty, skillfully paced action thriller.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-- The New York Times Book Review\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Page-turner of the week!&quot; -- People Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book flat-out rocks .. some of the best action writing I've ever read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-- Chistopher Moore, author of Lamb and You Suck\n\n&quot;One of the best opening sequences of any novel I've read. A Gen-X novel with the crucial addition of a plot.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n-- Richmond Review\n\nGenre: Action &amp; Adventure, Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:710f10d9d7f53ecf76016ae3ef511195745676bb","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Rush+by+Joe+Quirk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"710f10d9d7f53ecf76016ae3ef511195745676bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,15,16,217,215,245,62,207,118,1,106,227,239,81,17,149,116,86,118,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
