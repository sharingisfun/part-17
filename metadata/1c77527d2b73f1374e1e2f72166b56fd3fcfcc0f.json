With his brilliant portrait of Luce, a young woman who inherits her murdered sister's troubled twins, Frazier has created his most memorable heroine. Before the children, Luce was content with the reimbursements of the rich Appalachian landscape, choosing to live apart from the small community around her. But the coming of the children changes everything, cracking open her solitary life in difficult, hopeful, dangerous ways. In a lean, tight narrative, Nightwoods resonates with the timelessness of a great work of art.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c77527d2b73f1374e1e2f72166b56fd3fcfcc0f","amp;dn":"Nightwoods+by+Charles+Frazier+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c77527d2b73f1374e1e2f72166b56fd3fcfcc0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,119,82,125,43,115,241,55,78,30,47,114,22,107,86,253,63,207,204,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
