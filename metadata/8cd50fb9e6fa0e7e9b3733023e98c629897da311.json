But nothing about the case prepares them for what happens next: a second policeman dies . . . and then another . . .\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Police struggle to carry out their usual duties, but no one knows where or how this cop killer will strike again. While London disintegrates into lawlessness Maeve's world starts to fall apart too. For if the police can't keep themselves safe, how can they protect anyone else?\r\n\r\nAfter the Fire (Maeve Kerrigan Book #6)\r\nIs it an arson, accident or murder? After a fire rips through a North London tower block, two bodies are found locked in their 11th floor flat. But is the third victim that ensures the presence of detective Maeve Kerrigan and the murder squad. It appears that controversial MP Geoff Armstrong, trapped by the fire, chose to jump to his death rather than wait for rescue. But what was such a right wing politician doing in the deprived, culturally diverse Maudling Estate? As Maeve and her senior colleague, Derwent, pick through the wreckage, they uncover the secret world of the 11th floor, where everyone seems to have something to hide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cd50fb9e6fa0e7e9b3733023e98c629897da311","amp;dn":"Maeve+Kerrigan+Series+-+Jane+Casey+%28Books+5-6%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cd50fb9e6fa0e7e9b3733023e98c629897da311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,213,15,185,230,250,14,126,155,55,51,2,62,152,198,41,137,125,163,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
