It stars Jet Li, Aaliyah, Delroy Lindo, Isaiah Washington, Russell Wong, Anthony Anderson, D.B. Woodside, and DMX, and features action choreography by Corey Yuen. It is considered Jet Li's breakout role in the English film industry. Despite of the romantic main theme, in which it was originally slated to have a scene at the end where Jet Li and Aaliyah kiss, that kiss was cut in the final release. The comments by Jet Li indicate that the scene was removed because in the film a family member is murdered, and it would be inappropriate for him to be kissing a girl immediately afterwards from the rival family. The movie's setting was supposedly set in Oakland, California, but other than a few establishing shots, the film was entirely shot in Vancouver, Canada.\n\n\n\nAlso includes Romeo Must Die - Soundtrack - 01 - Aaliyah - Try Again.mp3\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d3b477d54ba6f57dd8848dbcf4293c117bb2006","amp;dn":"Jet+Li+-+Romeo+Must+Die.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d3b477d54ba6f57dd8848dbcf4293c117bb2006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,59,71,125,84,186,111,87,221,136,72,219,207,66,147,193,23,187,32,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
