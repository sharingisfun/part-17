The \n second edition is completely revised and greatly expanded, especially where texts, example \n sentences, exercises, and cartoons are concerned. It continues to provide a very lively and \n clearly written textbook. The book introduces basic concepts of grammar in a format which \n inspires the reader to use linguistic arguments. The style of the book is engaging and examples\n from poetry, jokes, and puns illustrate grammatical concepts. The focus is on syntactic analysis\n and evidence. However, special topic sections contribute sociolinguistic and historical reasons\n behind prescriptive rules such as the bans on split infinitives, dangling participles, and preposition\n stranding. The book is written for undergraduate students and structured for a semester-long course.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/cb60/15f1e3060.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08af3a155d1aa3921792cb608e93e4a139a7cc01","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+the+Grammar+of+English%2C+Revised+Edition+-Mant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08af3a155d1aa3921792cb608e93e4a139a7cc01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,175,58,21,93,26,163,146,23,146,203,96,142,147,228,161,57,167,204,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
