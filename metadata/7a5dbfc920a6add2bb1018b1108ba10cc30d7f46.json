However, the rise of industrialised fishing has not come without consequences, and many environmentalists and oceanographers believe that the current demand for fish and the methods used to fulfill it are taking an irreparable toll on the world's oceans, with some speculating that the seas could be literally fished-out by 2048 if current trends do not change.\n\n\nFilmmaker Rupert Murray offers an in-depth look at the crisis in the world's oceans in the documentary THE END OF THE LINE, in which experts discuss some of the key factors behind the looming shortage -- increased demand for endangered species, irresponsible methods employed by major fishing lines, lax enforcement of current regulations -- and what can be done to head off the famine before it's too late. \n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Rupert Murray\n--------------------------\n\n\nNarrated by: Ted Danson\n-----------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The End Of The Line\nYear: 2009\nFile Size: 698 MB\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:31:22\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1185 kbit/s\nDisplay Aspect ratio: 16/9\nFPS: 25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels: 2\nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176727/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1176727/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\t\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5dbfc920a6add2bb1018b1108ba10cc30d7f46","amp;dn":"The+End+Of+The+Line-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5dbfc920a6add2bb1018b1108ba10cc30d7f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,93,191,201,32,166,173,210,187,16,24,177,16,139,161,12,195,13,127,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
