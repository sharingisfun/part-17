Half-brothers Doughboy and Ricky Baker are foils for each other's personality, presenting very different approaches to the tough lives they face. Ricky is the 'All-American' athlete, looking to win a football scholarship to USC and seeks salvation through sports, while 'Dough' succumbs to the violence, alcohol, and crime surrounding him in his environment, but maintains a strong sense of pride and code of honor. Between these two is their friend Tre, who is lucky to have a father, 'Furious' Styles, to teach him to have the strength of character to do what is right and to always take responsibility for his actions. \n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoiiaadp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoiiaadp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoikaadp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoikaadp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoimaadp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoimaadp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoinaadp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaoinaadp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5db39870db5579aa51d8f9753979606daf05af0","amp;dn":"Boyz.N.The.Hood.1991.x264.AC3%2Baac.Audios.En.Fre.Ger.It.Spa.13.Su","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5db39870db5579aa51d8f9753979606daf05af0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,219,57,135,13,181,87,154,165,29,143,151,83,151,150,6,218,240,90,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
