Also imcluded are covers of Dixon's 'I Just Want to Make Love To You', Charles Brown's 'Driftin' Blues' and several relatively obscure Berry originals, including 'Wee Wee Hours', the B-side to his first single. \nClimaxed by a tribute to his beloved hometown via W.C. Handy's classic 'St. Louis Blues', Blues stands out as one of the most unique Berry compilations, offering a glimpse of the artist's musical roots.\n\nEAC/Cue/FLAC + Scans\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53d66d4b9f74424ed8ad53e0cc46081b59eac39a","amp;dn":"Chuck+Berry+-+Blues+%282003%29+EAC%2FCue%2FFLAC+%2B+Scans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53d66d4b9f74424ed8ad53e0cc46081b59eac39a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,214,109,75,159,116,66,78,216,173,83,224,204,70,8,27,89,234,195,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
