Shasha\n\n\n#Pages     : 192.\n#Publisher : Running Press Book Publishers, 2006\n#ISBN-13   : 9781560258315\n#Format    : EPUB\n\n\nGenius  mathematician, Dr.  Dennis Shasha,  here sets  out his  latest\nbook-length mind-twister.  Made up of  many smaller segments,  some of\nwhich  can  be  solved  by  ten year-olds  and  some  which  are  more\nchallenging,  the detective  work requires  no more  than high  school\ngeometry and  junior high school  algebra. In every  case, imagination\ntrumps knowledge.\n\nThe puzzles  are set  in a  larger story  of a  mathematical detective\nnamed  Dr. Ecco,  his nephew  and  niece, and  Professor Scarlet,  the\nnarrator. Scarlet  is essentially  the Watson  to Dr.  Ecco's Sherlock\nHolmes, asking the questions a reader  might ask. Each puzzle is posed\nin a  plausible if  imaginary real-life setting.  There are  no hidden\nfacts,  no  abduction  here,  just deductive  logic  and  mathematical\nthought.\n\nOverlaying these puzzles  are the ramblings of Dr  Ecco's old nemesis,\nBenjamin Baskerhound.  He seems to be  on the run, but  he's trying to\ntell Ecco his whereabouts in a way that only Ecco will understand. The\nevidence builds up and readers are invited to send in their solutions.\nThe  winner  will receive  a  pre-paid  trip  to  the home  of  modern\nmathematics, Sir Isaac Newton's Greenwich Observatory.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nDr. Dennis  Shasha is a professor  of computer science at  the Courant\nInstitute of NYU  where he works with biologists  on pattern discovery\nfor microarrays, combinatorial design, and network inference; and with\nphysicists and financial  people on algorithms for  time series. Other\nareas of  interest include database  tuning, tree and  graph matching,\nand cryptographic  file systems.  Because he &quot;likes  to type&quot;,  he has\nwritten  four  books of  puzzles,  a  biography about  great  computer\nscientists,  and technical  books  about  database tuning,  biological\npattern recognition and time series. He also writes the puzzle columns\nfor Scientific American and Dr. Dobb's Journal.\n\nAfter graduating from  Yale, Shasha worked for  IBM designing circuits\nand  microcode.  He  completed  his  Ph.D.  at  Harvard  in  1984.  He\nhas  written many  books,  including four  involving the  mathematical\ndetective Dr.  Ecco for W.H.  Freeman and W.W.  Norton, and a  book of\nbiographies about great computer scientists called Out of Their Minds:\nthe  lives  and  discoveries  of  15  great  computer  scientists.  In\naddition,  he has  co-written fifty  journal papers,  sixty conference\npapers, and seven patents.\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2330262c244ba69f0b1cdd36cb518ee6b2a18792","amp;dn":"Dennis+E.+Shasha+-+The+Puzzler%27s+Elusion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2330262c244ba69f0b1cdd36cb518ee6b2a18792","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,48,38,44,36,75,166,159,11,28,221,54,203,81,142,230,178,161,135,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
