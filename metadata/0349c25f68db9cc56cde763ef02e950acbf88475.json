When he published All Quiet on the Western Front, Remarque changed his middle name in memory of his mother and reverted to the earlier spelling of the family name to dissociate himself from his novel Die Traumbude. The original family name, Remarque, had been changed to Remark by his grandfather in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1927, Remarque made a second literary start with the novel Station at the Horizon (Station am Horizont), which was serialised in the sports journal &quot;Sport im Bild&quot; for which Remarque was working. It was published in book form only in 1998. His best-known work, All Quiet on the Western Front (Im Westen nichts Neues), was written in a few months in 1927, but Remarque was not immediately able to find a publisher. The novel, published in 1929, described the experiences of German soldiers during World War I. A number of similar works followed; in simple, emotive language they described wartime and the postwar years.\n\nIn 1931, after finishing The Road Back (Der Weg zurÃƒÂ¼ck), Remarque bought a villa in Porto Ronco, Switzerland, planning to live both there and in France.\n\nHis next novel, Three Comrades (Drei Kameraden), spans the years of the Weimar Republic, from the hyperinflation of 1923 to the end of the decade. Remarque's fourth novel, Flotsam (in German titled Liebe deinen NÃƒÂ¤chsten, or Love Thy Neighbour), first appeared in a serial version in English translation in Collier's magazine in 1939, and Remarque spent another year revising the text for its book publication in 1941, both in English and German. His next novel, Arch of Triumph, first published in 1945 in English, and the next year in German as Arc de Triomphe, was another instant best-seller and reached worldwide sales of nearly five million.\n\nThe torrent contains all the books in both ePUB and Mobi formats unless otherwise stated:\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1929)\n\nThe Road Back (1931)\n\nThree Comrades (1937)\n\nA Time to Love and a Time to Die (1954)\n\nThe Black Obelisk (1957)\n\nHeaven Has No Favorites (1961) -- ePUB\n\nThe Night in Lisbon (1964)\n\nShadows in Paradise (1972) --ePUB\n\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Maria_Remarque&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Maria_Remarque&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://remarque.org/about_remarque.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://remarque.org/about_remarque.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0622.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0622.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-hitlere.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.greatwar.nl/frames/default-hitlere.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0349c25f68db9cc56cde763ef02e950acbf88475","amp;dn":"Erich+Maria+Remarque+-+German+Author+%288+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0349c25f68db9cc56cde763ef02e950acbf88475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,73,194,95,104,219,156,197,108,222,118,62,240,46,149,10,203,248,132,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
