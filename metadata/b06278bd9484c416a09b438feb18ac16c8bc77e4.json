The duo was created in 2002 while the members, Geologic and Sabzi, were a part of The SHOW (Student Hip Hop Organization of Washington) at the University of Washington (Seattle). The group consists of one DJ, Sabzi (Saba Mohajerjasbi) and one MC, Geologic (George Quibuyen).\n\nThe name &quot;Blue Scholars&quot; is a play on the term &quot;blue collar,&quot; which is an idiom for workers who often earn meager hourly wages for manual labor. Their music and lyrics often focus on struggles between socioeconomic classes, challenging authority and youth empowerment, as evidenced in the songs &quot;Blink&quot; and &quot;Commencement Day.&quot; These themes are often specifically addressed in relation to the Seattle region, as in &quot;Southside Revival&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and &quot;The Ave.&quot;\n\n\nBoth albums in mp3 format, self-titled at 128kbps and The Long March at VBR213 or higher.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06278bd9484c416a09b438feb18ac16c8bc77e4","amp;dn":"Blue+Scholars+-+Self-Titled+%26+The+Long+March+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06278bd9484c416a09b438feb18ac16c8bc77e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,98,120,189,148,132,196,22,160,155,67,143,235,24,172,22,200,188,119,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
