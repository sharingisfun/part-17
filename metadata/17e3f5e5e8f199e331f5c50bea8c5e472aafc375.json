Its main features are the advanced hardware auto-detection (inherited from Knoppix), Brazilian Portuguese language and content and ease of use. The first releases of Kurumin were small enough to fit on a mini-CD, but that goal was abandoned with the release of Kurumin 4.0, when larger packages such as OpenOffice.org and a Java Virtual Machine were included. As of release 7.0, the size of the disk image is approximately 603MB. According to DistroWatch, Kurumin is the most popular Linux distribution in Brazil and is used by Brazilian Government.\n\nVersion 7.0, based on Debian &quot;Etch&quot;, was released February 22, 2007.\n\nThe distribution boasts a proprietary control center named ClicaAki (roughly: &quot;ClickHere&quot;), which features a series of &quot;magic icons&quot; that install software not included in the live CD (including games and proprietary video drivers) and configure a wide range of networking options. It also provides access to the Synaptic package manager.\n\nThe name comes from the Tupi word &quot;kurumi&quot;, which means boy. The usage of the letter K, instead of the usual Portuguese spelling (&quot;curumi&quot; or &quot;curumim&quot;), brings it in line with KDE (Kurumin&amp;#039;s default desktop environment), as well as with Knoppix.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17e3f5e5e8f199e331f5c50bea8c5e472aafc375","amp;dn":"Kurumin+Linux+7.0+-+Final+%28Brazilian+Linux+distribution%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17e3f5e5e8f199e331f5c50bea8c5e472aafc375","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,227,245,229,232,241,153,227,49,245,197,11,234,140,94,71,42,175,195,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
