Donaldson. It is an epic set in a future where humans have pushed far out into space in the name of commerce and follows two concurrent story arcs. The first concerns an ensign in the United Mining Companies Police (UMCP), Morn Hyland, who is attempting simply to stay alive after being captured by a marauder named Angus Thermopyle. The second follows the Byzantine political maneuvering of the head of the UMCP, Warden Dios, as he attempts to thwart the machinations of his boss, the CEO of United Mining Companies (UMC) itself, Holt Fasner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d15edbb48df053d62d1a1b17ab7b92ef0151d815","amp;dn":"The+Gap+Cycle+by+Stephen+R.+Donadlson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d15edbb48df053d62d1a1b17ab7b92ef0151d815","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,94,219,180,141,240,83,214,45,26,27,23,171,123,146,239,1,81,216,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
