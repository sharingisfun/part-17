A classic Hiatt record, the rockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ songs sizzle with the heat from two-lane blacktop on a summerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s day. Hiatt and his touring band (Kenny Blevins on drums, Patrick OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Hearn on bass and Doug Lancio on guitars) recorded a set that gives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGarage RockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a new meaning. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll the other years, my songs are about coming home,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Hiatt says. But within these 11 new songs, including HaulinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and the title track, The Open Road home is never the destination.\n\n\nRelease Date: 3/2/10\nLabel: New West\n\n   1.
