All the sewing techniques required for this traditional craft are included and most of the designs can be sewn by machine. All the templates for each design are listed and simply need to be copied and cut out. Each pattern is accompanied by design variations and they are given a contemporary twist with the clever use of colour and fabric. Clear instructions set out the method to be used, the order to follow to piece together individual blocks, and references given to techniques and finishes described elsewhere in the book. The combination of the exciting use of colour and fabric and the suggested variations make this an inspirational guide to dip into.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edb2174f9dd4b50a86d3786c48bee1cb2a93ac5b","amp;dn":"The+Quilter%27s+Recipe+Book%3A+All+the+Ingredients+You+Need+to+Creat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edb2174f9dd4b50a86d3786c48bee1cb2a93ac5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,178,23,79,157,212,181,10,134,211,120,108,72,190,225,203,42,147,172,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
