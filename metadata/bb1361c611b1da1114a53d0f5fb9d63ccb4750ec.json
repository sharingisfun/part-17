Frontman Jay Kay introduces himself with an environmentally oriented manifesto inside the sleeve, and his lyrics smack of idealist save the planet revolution. But this revolution would be held on the dancefloor if the band's impressive rhythm section had anything to say about it. Horns, string arrangements, and a didgeridoo provide full texture on most of the album's tunes, and the socially aware party vibe raged into the U.K.'s number one album slot. For a debut, Emergency shows quite a range of diversity, from the up-tempo jazzy instrumental &quot;Music of the Mind&quot; to the stop-start funk of &quot;Whatever It Is, I Just Can't Stop.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb1361c611b1da1114a53d0f5fb9d63ccb4750ec","amp;dn":"Jamiroquai+-+Emergency+on+Planet+Earth+%28Deluxe%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb1361c611b1da1114a53d0f5fb9d63ccb4750ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,19,97,198,17,177,218,17,20,165,61,15,95,185,214,60,203,71,80,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
