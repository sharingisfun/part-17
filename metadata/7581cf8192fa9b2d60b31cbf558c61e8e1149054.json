Its story has been characterised by incredible triumphs, but blighted by devastating tragedies - and the BBC and Horizon have chronicled every step of its career. This unique and poignant Horizon Guide brings together coverage from three decades of programmes to present a biography of the shuttle and to ask what its legacy will be. Will it be remembered as an impressive chapter in human space exploration, or as a fatally flawed white elephant?\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n1)  SD Version \n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1527 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25fps\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 1\n * Part Size: 703 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7581cf8192fa9b2d60b31cbf558c61e8e1149054","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Space+Shuttle+A+Horizon+Guide+PDTV+XviD+MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7581cf8192fa9b2d60b31cbf558c61e8e1149054","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,129,207,129,146,250,155,45,96,179,28,191,85,140,97,232,225,20,144,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
