The eight animation sequences are colorful, impressive, free-flowing, abstract, and often surrealistic pieces. They include the most famous of all, Paul Dukas's &quot;The Sorcerer's Apprentice&quot; with Mickey Mouse as the title character battling brooms carrying endless buckets of water. Also included are J.S. Bach's &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor&quot;; Tchaikovsky's &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;; dinosaurs and volcanoes in Stravinsky's &quot;Rite of Spring&quot;; the delightful &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot; by Ponchielli with dancing hippos, crocodiles, ostriches, and elephants; and Mussorgsky's darkly apocalyptic &quot;Night on Bald Mountain.&quot; Written by Tim Dirks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a1d7d97e803221851e77c82391692547bb10e61","amp;dn":"Walt+Disney%5C%27s+Fantasia+%281940%29+%28HiRes+576p%2C+h264%2C+5.1+AC3%2C+Ful","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a1d7d97e803221851e77c82391692547bb10e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,29,125,151,232,3,34,24,81,231,124,130,57,22,146,84,123,177,14,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
