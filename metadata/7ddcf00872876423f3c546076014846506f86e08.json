(Marcel Dekker, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nCatalysis and Electrocatalysis at Nanoparticle Surfaces illustrates the latest developments in electrochemical nanotechnology, heterogeneous catalysis, surface science, and theoretical modeling. It describes the manipulation, characterization, control, and application of nanoparticles for enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity and presents a range of experimental and synthetic strategies for work in nanoscale surface science.\r\nThisis a comprehensive source for physical, surface, and colloid chemists; materials scientists; interfacial chemists and electrochemists; electrochemical engineers; theoretical physicists; chemical engineers; and upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in these disciplines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ddcf00872876423f3c546076014846506f86e08","amp;dn":"Catalysis+and+Electrocatalysis+at+Nanoparticle+Surfaces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ddcf00872876423f3c546076014846506f86e08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,220,240,8,114,135,100,35,243,197,70,7,96,20,132,101,6,248,110,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
