This thunderous and introspective audiobookÃ¢â‚¬â€the ninth book of the award-winning seriesÃ¢â‚¬â€pits the earthy and robust Dave Robicheaux against forces of law and power far beyond his control. When a racially-motivated murder nearly three decades old churns back to the surface, Robicheaux is confronted by mob bosses, corrupt police chiefs and even dirtier politicians. Despite his efforts to stay clear of the action, he is inevitably drawn into the center of the conflict as evidence points to the current resident of the governorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mansion. Can Robicheaux uncover the truth and stay one step ahead of the people who want him silenced? Narrator Mark Hammer inhabits Dave Robicheaux and his world with the visceral gusto of a bayou native. Filled with spicy Louisiana politics and shady deals, Cadillac Jukebox is a riveting listen.
