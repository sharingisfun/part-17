And all of these musicians knowing when to play and more importantly when not to play. It truly is astounding (listen to the sound clips, you wont believe that it is a 20 piece band). And then you realze the instuments are talking to each other, Talking drum to talking drum (they actually converse, you need not know about african percussion to feel the conversation), the guitars converse in a talking drum like fasion, drum to guitar exchanges too.\nIt really is beautiful, grand, but subtle. As complex as a symphony, yet as eazy as acoustic blues.&quot;\n\n&quot;King Sunny Ade's &quot;Juju Music&quot; is one of the great albums of all time (and I mean in league with Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, Duke Ellington's &quot;At Newport&quot;, The Beatles' &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, etc.). It is hard to imagine a better album: the songs, the arrangements, the playing and singing, and the production are all perfect. This was one of the seminal African music albums of the 1980's; it brought a huge new audience to African music in America and Europe. Though nearly 20 years old it still sounds completely fresh and new. It is essential for anyone with an interest in African music. These days a lot of Afro-pop music sounds more and more pop (i.e., &quot;world&quot;) and less and less African. I am beginning to think that musicians of Ade's generation, who became prominent in the 1970's and 1980's, (such as Nigeria's Fela Kuti and Zaire's Franco &amp; Le Tpok Jazz) were the high point of African popular music. Though, like all modern African pop music, &quot;Juju Music&quot; incorporates various influences from outside Africa, Ade melds it together in a way that sounds genuine and original, and not like some calculated crossover attempt.&quot;\n\nBreezin says: &quot;I've seen this band performing live for over three hours in the famous Paradiso in Amsterdam somewhere in the early eightees when there was a real interest in African music which unfortunately lasted only a few years.\nThere is only one problem with this CD: It is just too short! It takes a few songs to really get into it and by the time you are groovin on the beat it has finished already. My personal medicin? Just put your CD player on repeat :) and play it the whole afternoon/evening!&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
