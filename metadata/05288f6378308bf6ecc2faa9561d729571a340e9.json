Using an original dataset, Richard Ned Lebow examines the distribution of wars across three and a half centuries and argues that, contrary to conventional wisdom, only a minority of these were motivated by security or material interest. Instead, the majority are the result of a quest for standing, and for revenge - an attempt to get even with states who had previously made successful territorial grabs. Lebow maintains that today none of these motives are effectively served by war - it is increasingly counterproductive - and that there is growing recognition of this political reality. His analysis allows for more fine-grained and persuasive forecasts about the future of war as well as highlighting areas of uncertainty.\n\nCambridge University Press \nNumber Of Pages: 318 \nPublication Date: 2010-10-11 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05288f6378308bf6ecc2faa9561d729571a340e9","amp;dn":"Why+Nations+Fight%3A+Past+and+Future+Motives+for+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05288f6378308bf6ecc2faa9561d729571a340e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,40,143,99,120,48,139,246,236,194,250,169,86,29,114,149,113,163,64,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
