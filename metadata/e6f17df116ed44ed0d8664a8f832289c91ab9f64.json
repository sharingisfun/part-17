Of course, it's one of his best.  William Shatner tears it up as a white supremacist who visits a small southern town and incites a riot over the recent racial integration of the town's public schools.  Very much of its time, and well worth seeing.  Filmed in a Missouri town where the locals were kept in the dark about the film's actual &quot;perspective&quot; on the integration issue.  Re-released over the years under various titles including &quot;I Hate Your Guts.&quot;  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f17df116ed44ed0d8664a8f832289c91ab9f64","amp;dn":"The+Intruder+-+R.+Corman+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f17df116ed44ed0d8664a8f832289c91ab9f64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,241,125,241,22,237,68,237,13,134,100,168,248,50,40,156,145,171,159,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
