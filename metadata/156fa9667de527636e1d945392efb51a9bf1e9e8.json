Benson's and Cole's careers are remarkably similar, both becoming known first as instrumentalists, Cole as a pianist, and Benson, of course, as a guitarist, with both eventually easing into the pop mainstream because of their voices. Cole was a one of a kind vocalist, of course, and even Benson wouldn't claim to equal him as a singer, but Benson has a similarly soothing and lush tenor voice that more than holds its own on these familiar songs. The album is bookended by two versions of the Cole classic &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; the first a rare recording of Benson at the age of eight singing it sweetly and charmingly while playing ukulele, while the album closes with a full big-band, Nelson Riddle-arranged orchestral version that also features some sweet guitar from Benson. In between are warm, smooth, and soothing versions of &quot;Walking My Baby Back Home&quot; and &quot;I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter,&quot; a bouncing and bopping &quot;Route 66,&quot; and nice takes on &quot;Unforgettable&quot; (featuring Wynton Marsalis), &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot; (featuring Idina Menzel), &quot;Smile&quot; (featuring Till BrÃƒÂ¶nner), and &quot;Too Young&quot; (featuring Judith Hill), all given the full big-band orchestral treatment from the Henry Mancini Institute Orchestra conducted by Randy Waldman (Waldman also arranged several of the pieces here). It all adds up to a sweet and very impressive album, full of warmth and heart, and it swings where it should. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t92.31% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tConcord\nCatalog:\t\tCRE-34268-03\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\n01.Mona Lisa (Lil' George Benson Age 8)\n02.Just One Of Those Things\n03.Unforgettable (Feat.
