It was the first single by the band to reach the Billboard Pop Singles Top 10, peaking at #8 and the first to popularize the band's sound, which would be emulated throughout the black music industry and dubbed &quot;psychedelic soul&quot;. It was later ranked #223 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n   &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; was one of the most influential songs of the late-1960s. The Sly &amp; the Family Stone sound became the dominating sound in African-American pop music for the next three years, and many established artists, such as The Temptations and their producer Norman Whitfield, Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, The Impressions, The Four Tops, The 5th Dimension, and War began turning out Family Stone-esque material. The Temptations, in fact, rode their first &quot;Dance to the Music&quot;-inspired single, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, all the way to the Pop Top Ten and to a 1968 Grammy Award. \n  &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; and the later Family Stone singles also helped lead to the development of what is now known as funk music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67032752fc0156c29fe37ca19097790c13d6aa7e","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+503","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67032752fc0156c29fe37ca19097790c13d6aa7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,3,39,82,252,1,86,194,159,227,124,161,144,151,121,12,19,214,170,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
