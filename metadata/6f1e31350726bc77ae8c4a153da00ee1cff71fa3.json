For various reason the harmonica was a most natural instrument of choice for Southern African-Americans in the development stages of the Blues. It was small, inexpensive, robust, portable, and user-friendly for a novice to approach. Furthermore it had the ability to imitate everything from the human voice to trains, animals, and whistling, as well as others instruments such as the accordion, a clarinet or cornet, and saxophone.\n\nThis double album features a number of artists who took a simple folk instrument and reinvented it as the wailing instrument, playing the Blues-harp sounds we know. These Legendary players were (are) significant in the development of the Modern Blues harmonica style. \n(liner notes)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Mississippi Saxophone - 1937-2011\n(2CD Music Avenue 2012)\n\n 1.
