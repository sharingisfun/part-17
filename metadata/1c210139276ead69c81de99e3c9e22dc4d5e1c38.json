Alston - A Realist Conception of Truth\n\nOne of the most important Anglo-American philosophers of our time here joins the current philosophical debate about the nature of truth. William P. Alston formulates and defends a realist conception of truth, which he calls alethic realism (from &quot;aletheia,&quot; Greek for truth). This idea holds that the truth value of a statement (belief or proposition) depends on whether what the statement is about is as the statement says it is. Michael Dummett and Hilary Putnam are two of the prominent and widely influential contemporary philosophers whose anti-realist ideas Alston attacks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c210139276ead69c81de99e3c9e22dc4d5e1c38","amp;dn":"William+P.+Alston+-+A+Realist+Conception+of+Truth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c210139276ead69c81de99e3c9e22dc4d5e1c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,33,1,57,39,110,173,105,200,29,233,158,60,158,34,220,77,94,28,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
