The year is 1606, the golden age of Prague, cultured and financed by Rudolf II. The Emperor's mad bastard son, Don Julius, scandalizes the cities of Prague and Vienna and is banished to the walled town of Cesky Krumlov in the furthest reaches of Bohemia, and locked in the towering Rozenberk castle. By order of the Emperor, two bloodletters - Royal Physician Mingonius and local Barber-Surgeon Pichler - come to rid Don Julius of the murderous humors that course his veins. But it is Pichler's daughter Marketa, a simple Bohemian bathmaid, who captures the frenzied imagination of the lunatic Hapsburg prince. Inspired by a true murder story that shook the Hapsburg Royal Houses of Europe and contributed to the downfall of an emperor, The Bloodletter's Daughter captures the rich historical detail and dark drama of passion and revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22ff4279b5df3011a6176014258b0ab5148049ec","amp;dn":"The+Bloodletter%27s+Daughter+by+Linda+Lafferty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22ff4279b5df3011a6176014258b0ab5148049ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,255,66,121,181,223,48,17,166,23,96,20,37,139,10,181,20,128,73,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
