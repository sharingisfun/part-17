Arias (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nPharmacotherapy is often limited by the inefficient activity and severe toxicity of drug molecules. Nanotechnology offers a revolutionary and definitive approach for the efficient delivery of drug molecules to non-healthy tissues and cells. This first volume of a series of two volumes analyzes the basics in the development of drug-loaded nanoplatforms, the so-called nanomedicines. Special attention is given to physicochemical engineering, pharmacokinetics, biocompatibility and biodegradability, representative nanoplatforms (based on lipids, polymers, cyclodextrins, metals, carbon, silica, iron oxides, etc.), and advanced nano-engineering strategies for passive, ligand-mediated, and/or stimuli-sensitive drug delivery and release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:268f23483ea67a47e13f7d3caac750197b3b0c2d","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+and+Drug+Delivery+Vol.+1+-+Nanoplatforms+in+Drug+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"268f23483ea67a47e13f7d3caac750197b3b0c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,143,35,72,62,166,122,71,225,63,125,60,170,199,80,25,123,59,12,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
