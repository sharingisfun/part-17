As Joel Reynolds launches a legal fight to expose and challenge the Navy program, marine biologist Ken Balcomb witnesses a mysterious mass stranding of whales near his research station in the Bahamas. Investigating this calamity, Balcomb is forced to choose between his conscience and an oath of secrecy he swore to the Navy in his youth.\n\nWhen Balcomb and Reynolds team up to expose the truth behind an epidemic of mass strandings, the stage is set for an epic battle that pits admirals against activists, rogue submarines against weaponized dolphins, and national security against the need to safeguard the ocean environment. Waged in secret military labs and the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest court, War of the Whales is a real-life thriller that combines the best of legal drama, natural history, and military intrigue.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nKen Balcomb: http://www.whaleresearch.com/#!staff/cyhe\nJoel Reynolds: http://www.nrdc.org/about/staff/joel-reynolds\n\nNotes: On the Samsung using the application Aldiko found that the first few pages of the epub have problems displaying proportionately.
