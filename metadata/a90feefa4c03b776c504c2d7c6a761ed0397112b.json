The Beatles Story comes in 14 parts, approximately 45 \nminutes each. Total time: 10 hours and 43 minutes. Bitrate: 128kbs.\n\nVery Enjoyable. Some kinda 'Anthology' made in the 70's, 3 years after their \nsplit-up. Solid old style BBC radioprogram. A 20th century fairytale...\nAnd, of course, with all music from vinyl.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a90feefa4c03b776c504c2d7c6a761ed0397112b","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+Story+%281973+BBC+Radio+Special%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a90feefa4c03b776c504c2d7c6a761ed0397112b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,15,238,250,76,3,183,118,197,4,194,215,198,167,97,237,3,151,17,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
