It shows how democracy is repeatedly violated by corporate oligopolies, and how popular forces have fought back and occasionally made gains in spite of the system. By focusing on the relationship between economic power and political power, discussing actual government practices and policies, conspiracies, propaganda, fraud, secrecy and other ploys of government and politics, this book stands apart in its analysis of how US Government works.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Few-Michael-Parenti/dp/0495911267/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347123393&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=democracy+for+the+few&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Few-Michael-Parenti/dp/0495911267/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347123393&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=democracy+for+the+few&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9582238135c10758bd4ccfa9b510e358cb4b1b1","amp;dn":"Democracy+for+the+Few","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9582238135c10758bd4ccfa9b510e358cb4b1b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,88,34,56,19,92,16,117,139,212,204,250,155,81,14,53,140,180,177,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
