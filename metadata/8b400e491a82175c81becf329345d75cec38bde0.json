All the favorites are here: Walter, the grumpy retiree; furry and manic Peanut; Jose JalapeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o, the spicy pepper from south of the border; plus bumbling skeletal Achmed the Dead Terrorist. Dunham is also joined by two never-before-seen characters certain to unleash their own unique havoc on stage.\n\n\nsharedump.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b400e491a82175c81becf329345d75cec38bde0","amp;dn":"Jeff.Dunham.Controlled.Chaos.2011.Swesub.DVDrip.Xvid.AC3-Haggebu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b400e491a82175c81becf329345d75cec38bde0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,64,14,73,26,130,23,92,129,190,207,50,147,69,215,92,236,56,189,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
