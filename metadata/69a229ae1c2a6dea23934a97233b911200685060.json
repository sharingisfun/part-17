At its heart are Powell's &quot;Thirteen Rules&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€notes he gathered over the years and that now form the basis of his leadership presentations given throughout the world. Powell's short but sweet rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€among them, &quot;Get mad, then get over it&quot; and &quot;Share credit&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€are illustrated by revealing personal stories that introduce and expand upon his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others. In work and in life, Powell writes, &quot;it's about how we touch and are touched by the people we meet. It's all about the people.&quot;\n\n\nA natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables with wise advice on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. &quot;Trust your people,&quot; he counsels as he delegates presidential briefing responsibilities to two junior State Department desk officers. &quot;Do your bestÃ¢â‚¬â€someone is watching,&quot; he advises those just starting out, recalling his own teenage summer job mopping floors in a soda-bottling factory.\n\n\nPowell combines the insights he has gained serving in the top ranks of the military and in four presidential administrations with the lessons he's learned from his immigrant-family upbringing in the Bronx, his training in the ROTC, and his growth as an Army officer. The result is a powerful portrait of a leader who is reflective, self-effacing, and grateful for the contributions of everyone he works with.\n\nColin Powell's It Worked for Me is bound to inspire, move, and surprise readers. Thoughtful and revealing, it is a brilliant and original blueprint for leadership.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a229ae1c2a6dea23934a97233b911200685060","amp;dn":"It+Worked+for+Me%3A+In+Life+and+Leadership+Colin+Powell+-+Epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a229ae1c2a6dea23934a97233b911200685060","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,162,41,174,28,42,109,234,35,147,74,151,35,59,145,18,0,104,80,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
