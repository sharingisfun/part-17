Geddy Lee talks about the growing success of the band and their approach - moving away from conceptual albums - to their new album, the then unrecorded and untitled Permanent Waves.\nStudio interview at Le Studio, Montreal (1980) (12:59). All three members of the band discuss their new approach to writing and recording, and their enjoyment of live performance. Neil and Geddy do most of the talking, Alex goofs around ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as usual.\n1980sArtist of the Decade (1990) (15:32). A fabulous interview with all the members of the band interviewed separately, reflecting on the highs and lows of their career and illustrating the indomitable spirit of Rush.\nCBC Television: Juno Awards show (1994) (17:33). An awards ceremony to celebrate RushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, this features interview and performance clips, including a tribute from Mike Myers and other celebrity fans. Again, the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sense of humour comes through here.\nInterview for release of Vapor Trails (2002) (12:51). Alex and Geddy talk about the apprehension of going back to the studio and how the band spirit and music came together again after a long separation. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some reflection on the hard work that made them successful, like the recording of 1974's Fly By Night in 4 days in between the 250 gigs they played that year.\nThe Anthem Vault\nFly By Night (3:25) is a mimed performance in a studio from 1975 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one of the Church Session Videos.\nFinding My Way (4:22) and In The Mood (3:20) are of very rough quality, shown in small, window-boxed format because of the low and fuzzy quality of the video. Nevertheless they feature furious and energetic live performances of these early tracks and are well worth inclusion regardless of the picture quality.\nCircumstances (3:43) is a live in the studio performance which overuses the starburst filter on the camera.\nLa Villa Strangiato (10:12), is a full straight run-through of the song live in 1978 - a virtuoso display from Alex Lifeson demonstrating his ability to get an incredible range of sounds from one guitar.\nA Farewell to Kings (5:52) and Xanadu (11:10) feature the band in flowing capes during their madrigal period. These are mimed to studio performances on a stage setting.\nThe Spirit of Radio (1:02) is a brief soundcheck at the Hamilton Ivor Wynne Stadium in 1979.\nFreewill (5:34) is a recording from the Toronto Rocks / Rolling Stones Concert, 2003, and by God, Geddy Lee can still hit those high notes!\nCloser to the Heart (3:25) sees the band with a couple of guests performing in a recording studio for the Canadian Tsunami Disaster Fund charity telethon on CBC television in 2005. This is a lovely little performance.\n\nDVD1 Info\nSize: 7.88 Gb ( 8 266 110 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nVTS_01 :\nPlay Length: 02:13:00\nVideo: NTSC 16:9 (720x480) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\nAudio:\nEnglish (LinearPCM, 2 ch)\nEnglish (Dolby AC3, 6 ch)\nVTS_02 :\nPlay Length: 00:00:19\nVideo: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nAudio:\nEnglish (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\n\nDVD2 Info\nSize: 5.82 Gb ( 6 106 504 KBytes ) - DVD-9\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nVTS_01 :\nPlay Length: 00:10:00+00:13:00+00:15:34+00:17:33+00:12:51+00:03:20+00:04:22+00:03:43+00:10:13+00:05:52+00:11:09+00:01:02+00:05:34+00:03:27+00:02:35+00:01:24\nVideo: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nAudio:\nEnglish (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\n\nGeddy Lee - Bass Guitar, Vocals, Keys\nAlex Lifeson - Electric &amp; Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals\nNeil Peart - Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235ab7ffe73ab49366abf3dfb37765f543f0d2c1","amp;dn":"Rush+-+R30+30th+Anniversary+World+Tour+%282005%29+%5B2xDVD9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235ab7ffe73ab49366abf3dfb37765f543f0d2c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,90,183,255,231,58,180,147,102,171,243,223,179,119,101,245,67,240,210,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
