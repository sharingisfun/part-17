Since Apache Drums has been put up, I thought I'd do this as well.\n\nThe aftermath of war is quite an important subject nowadays, so it should be interesting to see how people back then dealt with such subjects as war wounds, missing-in-action, overseas prisoners and suchlike. The acting is great;you are advised not to pay toomuch attention to the story - Lewton was out of his depth when not dealing with horror.\n\nAt any rate, this is your chance to study the development of a major auteur. (He produced but did not direct this movie).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:385ec480f543422f1f063ca7b6664a387c5dd22b","amp;dn":"My+Own+True+Love+%281949%29+Val+lewton+Phyllis+Calvert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"385ec480f543422f1f063ca7b6664a387c5dd22b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,94,196,128,245,67,66,47,31,6,60,167,182,102,74,56,124,93,210,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
