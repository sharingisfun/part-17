Produced by Rupert Hine, the album is a low-key, laid-back affair featuring guest appearances by Eric Bazilian and Martha Davis. Milla has a pleasant voice and above-average songwriting ability, and the songs are organic, light, airy concoctions that work well in their understated settings.&quot;\n\nRipped with EAC 0.99pre-beta in lossless FLAC format.\n\nTracks:\n\n1. The Alien Song (for those who listen)\n2. Gentleman Who Fell\n3. It's Your Life\n4. Reaching From Nowhere\n5. Charlie\n6. Ruby Lane\n7. Bang Your Head\n8. Clock\n9. Don't Fade Away\n10. You Did It All Before\n11. In A Glade\n\nArt:\n\nFront Cover 600px\nInsert 500px\n\nIf you enjoy this music, please comment and SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5864f3f126d6426b64a4eb239b2ef0ce4fcef7d4","amp;dn":"Milla+%5BJovovich%5D+-+The+Divine+Comedy+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5864f3f126d6426b64a4eb239b2ef0ce4fcef7d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,100,243,241,38,214,66,107,100,164,235,35,155,46,240,206,79,206,247,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
