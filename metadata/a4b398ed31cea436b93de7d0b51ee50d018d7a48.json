But the pillars of the liberal classÃ¢â‚¬â€ the press, universities, the labor movement, the Democratic Party, and liberal religious institutionsÃ¢â‚¬â€have collapsed. In its absence, the poor, the working class, and even the middle class no longer have a champion.\n\nIn this searing polemic Chris Hedges indicts liberal institutions, including his former employer, the New York Times, who have distorted their basic beliefs in order to support unfettered capitalism, the national security state, globalization, and staggering income inequalities. Hedges argues that the death of the liberal class created a profound vacuum at the heart of American political life. And now speculators, war profiteers, and demagoguesÃ¢â‚¬â€ from militias to the Tea PartyÃ¢â‚¬â€are filling the void.\n\nshunster\n\npls seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4b398ed31cea436b93de7d0b51ee50d018d7a48","amp;dn":"Death+of+the+Liberal+Class+%26ndash%3B+Chris+Hedges+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4b398ed31cea436b93de7d0b51ee50d018d7a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,179,152,237,49,206,164,54,185,61,231,208,181,30,229,13,1,141,122,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
