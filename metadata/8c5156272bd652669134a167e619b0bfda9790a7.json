The album was released on September 5, 2011 as part of Queen's 40th Anniversary. Deep Cuts Volume 3 was released simultaneously as the third five reissues of the Queen studio albums (The Works, A Kind of Magic, The Miracle, Innuendo and Made in Heaven) from which the songs are sampled. In this release, &quot;Khashoggi's Ship&quot; has a drum intro (to separate it from the song &quot;Party&quot;, which was not included in this compilation) and &quot;It's a Beautiful Day (Reprise)&quot; starts with 15 seconds of silence and ends with &quot;Yeah&quot; (which is a separate track in Made in Heaven).\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Made in Heaven&quot;   \tFreddie Mercury \t5:27\n02. \t&quot;Machines [Or 'Back to Humans']&quot;   \tBrian May, Roger Taylor \t5:07\n03. \t&quot;Don't Try So Hard&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury) \t3:40\n04. \t&quot;Tear It Up&quot;   \tMay \t3:24\n05. \t&quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot;   \tMercury \t4:50\n06. \t&quot;A Winter's Tale&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury) \t3:52\n07. \t&quot;Ride the Wild Wind&quot;   \tQueen (Taylor) \t4:43\n08. \t&quot;Bijou&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury, May) \t3:37\n09. \t&quot;Was It All Worth It&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury) \t5:45\n10. \t&quot;One Year of Love&quot;   \tJohn Deacon \t4:27\n11. \t&quot;Khashoggi's Ship&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury) \t2:52\n12. \t&quot;Is This The World We Created...?&quot;   \tMercury, May \t2:12\n13. \t&quot;The Hitman&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury, May, Deacon) \t4:56\n14. \t&quot;It's A Beautiful Day [Reprise]&quot;   \tQueen (Mercury) \t3:21\n15. \t&quot;Mother Love&quot;   \tMercury, May \t4:48","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c5156272bd652669134a167e619b0bfda9790a7","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Deep+Cuts+Volume+3+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c5156272bd652669134a167e619b0bfda9790a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,81,86,39,43,214,82,102,145,52,161,103,230,25,176,191,218,151,144,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
