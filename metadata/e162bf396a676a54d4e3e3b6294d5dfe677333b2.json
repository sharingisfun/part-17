One of Atisha&amp;#039;s main accomplishments in Tibet was his writing of the seminal text, A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, in which he extracted the essence of all 84,000 teachings of the Buddha and organized them into a clear, step-like arrangement that makes it easy for any individual practitioner to understand and practice the Dharma. This genre of teachings is known as lam-rim, or steps of the path, and forms an essential part of every school of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn this book, His Holiness the Dalai Lama gives a commentary to not only Atisha&amp;#039;s revolutionary work but also to Lines of Experience, a short text written by Lama Tsong Khapa, who was perhaps the greatest of all Tibetan lam-rim authors. In bringing together Atisha, Lama Tsong Khapa and His Holiness the Dalai Lama, this book offers readers one of the clearest and most authoritative expositions of the Tibetan Buddhist path ever published, and it is recommended for those at the beginning of the path, the middle and the end. This is the first time a major teaching by the Dalai Lama has been published for free distribution. \n\n(Uploaded through the kind permission of)          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.lamayeshe.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.lamayeshe.com&lt;/a&gt;\n***********************************************************************************\n*                                                                                 *\n*  *LYWA      *LYWA*      *LYWA* *LYWA   *LYWA   *LYWA    *LYWA   *LYWA*          *\n*   LYWA        LYWA      LYWA    LYWA    LYWA    LYWA     LYWA    *LYWA*         *\n*   LYWA         LYWA    LYWA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA     LYWA    *L.Y.WA*        *\n*   LYWA          LYWA  LYWA       LYWA     LYWA LYWA     LYWA    LYWALYWA        *\n*   LYWA           LYWALYWA         LYWA    LYWALYWA     LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA            L.Y.WA          LYWA     L.Y.WA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWA    LYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWALYWALYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA   L.Y.W.A   LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA  LYWA LYWA *LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              LYWALYWA   LYWALYWA    LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              L.Y.W.A    L.Y.W.A     LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA               LYWA*      LYWA*     LYWA          LYWA   *\n*  ~LYWA*LYWA*LYWA* ~LYWA~              LYWA       LYWA     ~LYWA~        ~LYWA~  *\n*                                                                                 *\n*      ~LAMA~      *      ~YESHE~       *      ~WISDOM~      *      ~ARCHIVE~     *\n*                                                                                 *\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive (LYWA) is the collected works of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Kyabje Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The Archive was founded in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, its spiritual director, to make available in various ways the teachings it contains. Publication of books of edited teachings for free distribution is one of the ways.\n\nPlease visit http://www.lamayeshe.com for HEAPS of Dharma material\n\nLama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche began teaching at Kopan Monastery, Nepal, in 1970. Since then, their teachings have been recorded and transcribed. At present we have more than 10,000 hours of digital audio and some 60,000 pages of raw transcript on our computers. Many recordings, mostly teachings by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, remain to be transcribed, and as Rinpoche continues to teach, the number of recordings in the Archive increases accordingly. Most of our transcripts have been neither checked nor edited.\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. We are a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible, non-profit corporation dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings and totally dependent upon your donations for our continued existence.
