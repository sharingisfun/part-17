Ajayan, Linda S. Schadler and Paul V. Braun\nReview\n\n&quot;This book grew on me the more I read it. It really does achieve the editors' aim of providing examples and concepts that elucidate the nature of the field. The style is clear and the writing excellent. It is much more readable than the catalogue-style literature review often presented, and the authors have clearly not only exercised judgment in their selection of topics, they are all able to weave them into a coherent narrative. Even the fourth chapter, in which modelling of nanocomposites is surveyed in seven pages without a single equation, is an elegant tour de de force...This book will repay the thoughtful reader and is to be recommended as a guide to this exciting field.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stephen Kukureka FIMMM (Senior Lecturer, University of Birmingham), Materials World, 2/04\n\n&quot;... the book can serve as a valuable source of inspiration for materials scientists and engineers in general. It can be recommendedas a further reading for a relatively wide audience.&quot;\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Willi Pabst, Ceramics - SilikÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ty, Institute of Chemical Technology, Prague, 3/2004\n\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 239 pages\nPublisher: Wiley-VCH (October 3, 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3527303596\nISBN-13: 978-3527303595\n\n[poly-technic.blogsopt]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0519bec942efe33fae9de82b535bcccf332ad972","amp;dn":"Nanocomposite+Science+and+Technology+by+Ajayan%2C+Schadler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0519bec942efe33fae9de82b535bcccf332ad972","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,25,190,201,66,239,227,63,174,157,232,43,83,91,204,207,51,42,217,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
