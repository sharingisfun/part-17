Even Wooley's trumpeting can't match the compelling\ninteraction that exists between Mike Bisio and the Norwegian Ingebrigt HÃƒÂ¥ker\nFlaten. Though listed as four separate tracks, these live pieces of Nididhyasana\n(recorded in January 2007 at Downtown Music Gallery) have the quality of a\nsuite, a lengthy cracking of a single faultline. The basses are kept wide apart,\none in each speaker's spatial extreme, which draws even more attention to their\npointillist twanging, or even their twinned droning. As if in keeping with these\ndeep emanations, Wooley concentrates on a muted needling, as if trying to rise\nabove the low thrum. When all four players are coinciding in motion, a termite's\nnest bustle erupts; but some of the most striking sections are when the two\nbassmen are left alone to conduct their own conversation. Gauci almost finds\nhimself standing on the perimeter, his warm foxglove tone acting as a soothing\nagent. Without a drummer, of course, there's little forward motion, the\nimprovisations tending to float in oily suspension. There are parts where all\nband members are firing off at once and the climactic stretch of &quot;Chitta Vilasa\nis one such instance.\n\n--\n\nby Stef\n\nby Derek Taylor &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/001882.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bagatellen.com/archives/reviews/001882.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\npar FÃƒÂ©lix-Antoine Hamel (fr)\n\ndi Ciro Riccardi (it) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=2582&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://italia.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=2582&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455d51ade620b1e5c1a3baf244950d44f8599a38","amp;dn":"Stephen+Gauci%27s+Basso+Continuo+-+Nididhyasana+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455d51ade620b1e5c1a3baf244950d44f8599a38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,93,81,173,230,32,177,229,193,163,186,242,68,149,13,68,248,89,154,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
