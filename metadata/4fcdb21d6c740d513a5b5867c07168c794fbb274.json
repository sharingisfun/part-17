It is a mantra, a duty, a way of life in a tightly monitored world where thinking is dangerous and books are forbidden.\n\nIn 1953, Ray Bradbury envisioned one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most unforgettable dystopian futures, and in Ray BradburyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fahrenheit 451, the artist Tim Hamilton translates this frightening modern masterpiece into a gorgeously imagined graphic novel. As could only occur with BradburyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full cooperation in this authorized adaptation, Hamilton has created a striking work of art that uniquely captures MontagÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s awakening to the evil of government-controlled thought and the inestimable value of philosophy, theology, and literature.\n\nIncluding an original foreword by Ray Bradbury and fully depicting the brilliance and force of his canonic and beloved masterwork, Ray BradburyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fahrenheit 451 is an exceptional, haunting work of graphic literature.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fcdb21d6c740d513a5b5867c07168c794fbb274","amp;dn":"Fahrenheit+451+-+The+Authorized+Adaption+%5BGraphic+Novel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fcdb21d6c740d513a5b5867c07168c794fbb274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,205,178,29,108,116,13,81,58,91,88,103,192,113,104,199,148,251,178,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
