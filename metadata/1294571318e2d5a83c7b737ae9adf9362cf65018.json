In the AFC Championship game against Denver, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually got into the game. With a 17-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provided what was arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he became a national laughingstock and, of course, was immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams.\n\nBut all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent, Arnie, find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds, Arnie finally locates just such a team and informs Rick that, miraculously, he can in fact now be a starting quarterback: for the mighty Panthers of Parma, Italy.\n\nYes, Italians do play American football, to one degree or another, and the Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player, any former NFL player, at their helm. So Rick reluctantly agrees to play for the Panthers, at least until a better offer comes along, and he heads off to Italy. He knows nothing about Parma, not even where it is, has never been to Europe, and doesn't speak or understand a word of Italian. To say that Italy holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement.\n     This is a great book. I preffer only the unAbridged book cause of the driving that I do. So if you drive alot this book will keep you company for a long time....enjoy!\nunabridged 6hrs 53min.\n\n\nAzoozz  :-)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1294571318e2d5a83c7b737ae9adf9362cf65018","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+Playing+for+Pizza+%5Bazoozz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1294571318e2d5a83c7b737ae9adf9362cf65018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,148,87,19,24,226,213,168,60,123,115,122,233,173,249,54,44,246,80,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
