Unfortunately the mastering left something to be desired.  When it was released on CD there were some edits made that shortened the album.  This brought it down to 80 minutes, presumably to fit it on one CD, but the CD release, strangely, was 2 CDs.  The editing wasn't necessary after all.\n\nSo I took the CD and recut most of the missing bits back into the sequence from the LP.  I also remastered the whole thing, removing noise and beefing up the low end which was sadly lacking on all releases.  Partially this is because of a rather crappy job of recording the bass guitar, but mostly it was from too conservative mastering.  Worst part is the bass level was different from song to song, and was particularly lacking in Babylon. Now this thing has punch.\n\nThe only parts of the editing I left from the CD version are the segue from Seven Trumpets to Altamont and the crossfade from Loud Loud Loud into The Four Horsemen.   For Loud/Horsemen it just flowed better with an overlap, whereas on the album the two are nearly, but not quite,  separated.  As for Seven Trumpets, on the original the voice says &quot;...the music changes!&quot; and there is an abrupt cut to &quot;this is the sight we had one day on the high mountain&quot;, followed by the fade in of Altamont.  On the CD the high mountain bit is cut and the Altamont fade in begins as &quot;the music changes&quot; is spoken, presenting a much better segue between the tracks.  This is the only good decision the editors of the CD made, and I kept it that way.\n\n01 The System\n02 Babylon\n03 Loud Loud Loud\n04 The Four Horsemen\n05 The Lamb\n06 The Seventh Seal\n07 Aegian Sea\n08 Seven Bowls\n09 The Wakening Beast\n10 Lament\n11 The Marching Beast\n12 The Battle of the Locusts\n13 Do It\n14 Tribulation\n15 The Beast\n16 Ofis\n17 Seven Trumpets\n18 Altamont\n19 The Wedding of the Lamb\n20 The Capture of the Beast\n21 Infinity\n22 Hic Et Nunc\n23 All The Seats Were Occupied\n24 Break","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:775fe737fc1acd33d656e126bb49e3f65cad14c3","amp;dn":"Aphrodite%27s+Child+-+666+%28remastered+and+restored+by+%7D%7Beywood%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"775fe737fc1acd33d656e126bb49e3f65cad14c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,95,231,55,252,26,205,51,214,86,225,38,187,73,227,246,92,173,20,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
