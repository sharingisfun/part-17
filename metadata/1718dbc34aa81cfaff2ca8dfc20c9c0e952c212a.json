I don't know. Orphans is a dead end kid driving a coffin with big tires across the Ohio River wearing welding goggles and a wife beater with a lit firecracker in his ear.\n\nAt the center of this record is my voice. I try my best to chug, stomp, weep, whisper, moan, wheeze, scat, blurt, rage, whine, and seduce. With my voice, I can sound like a girl, the boogieman, a Theremin, a cherry bomb, a clown, a doctor, a murderer - I can be tribal. Ironic. Or disturbed. My voice is really my instrument. \n\nKathleen and I wanted the record to be like emptying our pockets on the table after an evening of gambling, burglary, and cow tipping. We enjoy strange couplings, that's how we got together. We wanted Orphans to be like a shortwave radio show where the past is sequenced with the future, consisting of things you find on the ground, in this world and no world, or maybe the next world. Whatever you imagine that to be. \n\nIf a record really works at all, it should be made like a homemade doll with tinsel for hair and seashells for ears stuffed with candy and money. Or like a good woman's purse with a Swiss army knife and a snake bite kit.\n\nOrphans contains songs for all occasions. Some of the songs were written in turmoil and recorded at night in a moving car, others were written in hotel rooms and recorded in Hollywood during big conflamas. That's when conflict weds drama. At any rate these are the ones that survived the flood and were rescued from the branches of trees after the water's retreat.\n\nGathering all this material together was like rounding up chickens at the beach. It's not like you go into vault and check out what you need. Most of it was lost or buried under the house. Some of the tapes I had to pay ransom for to a plumber in Russia. You fall into the vat. We started to write just to climb out of the vat. Then you start listening and sorting and start writing in response to what you hear. And more recording. And then you get bit by a spider, go down the gopher hole, and make a whole different record. That was the process pretty much the last three years.\n\nThen we met Karl Derfler, a wizard engineer who works at Bay Side Studios in Richmond, CA, in the science fiction part of town. A battlefield medic, he did a Lazarus on a number of the songs and recorded all the new material.\n\nOn Orphans there is a mambo about a convict who breaks out of jail with a fishbone, a gospel train song about Charlie Whitman and John Wilkes Boothe, a delta blues about a disturbing neighbor, a spoken word piece about a woman who was struck by lightening, an 18th century Scottish madrigal about murderous sibling rivalry, an American backwoods a cappella about a hanging. Even a song by Jack Kerouac and a spiritual with my own personal petition to the Lord with prayer.. There's even a show tune about an old altar boy and a rockabilly song about a young man who's begging to be lied to. \n\nI think you will find more singing and dancing here than usual. But I hope fans of more growling, more warbling, more barking, more screeching won't be disappointed either.\n\nTom Waits\nAugust 2006\n\nPersonnel:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tom Waits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, guitar, pump organ, keyboards, percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dave Alvin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Anges Amar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ whistles\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ara Anderson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ray Armando ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bobby Baloo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ cowbells, boulders\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bobby Black ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ steel guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Michael Blair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Andrew Borger ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Brain ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Matt Brubeck ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dan Cantrell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ accordion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ralph Carney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Crispin Cioe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bent Clausen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ banjo, piano\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Les Claypool ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Jimmy Cleveland ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Harry Codyc ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ banjo\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Greg Cohen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Eddie Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ banjo\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Darrel Devore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ circular violin\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Seth Ford-Young ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Steve Foreman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mitchell Froom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ chamberlin\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bob Funk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Joe Gore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Chris Grady ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Brett Gurewitz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ron Hacker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ John Hammond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Arno Hecht ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Billy Higgins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Art Hillery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Stephen Hodges ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bart Hopkins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bamboo clarinet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Trevor Horn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Carla Kihlstedt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ violin\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Guy Klucevsek ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ accordion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Gary Knowlton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mike Knowlton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Larry LaLonde ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Adam Lane ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mark Linkous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, bass, drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Paul &quot;Hollywood&quot; Litteral ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Charlie Musselwhite ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tom Nunn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Bug\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Eric Perney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Nic Phelps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ horns\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dan Plonsey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ clarinet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Steve Prutsman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Marc Ribot ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Bebe Risenfors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ clarinet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Gino Robair ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mike Silverman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Jeff Sloan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Nolan Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Matthew Sperry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Colin Stetson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ saxophone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Larry Taylor ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Francis Thumm ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Leroy Vinnegar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Casey Waits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sullivan Waits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Richard Waters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ waterphone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Tom Yoder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nAll songs by Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan, except where otherwise noted.\n\nDisc one: Brawlers\n\n1. &quot;Lie to Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:10\n2. &quot;LowDown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n3. &quot;2:19&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02 \n4. &quot;Fish in the Jailhouse&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n5. &quot;Bottom of the World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42 \n6. &quot;Lucinda&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n7. &quot;Ain't Goin' Down to the Well&quot; (Lead Belly, John Lomax, Alan Lomax) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:28\n8. &quot;Lord I've Been Changed&quot; (trad. arr.
