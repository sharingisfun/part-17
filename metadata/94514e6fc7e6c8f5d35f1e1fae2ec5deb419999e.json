Whats here is the British take on American instrumental music which shows that the British could copy as well as the Americans.\nTaken from the Pye and Picadilly catalogues these are names which probably mean nothing in the States apart from Kenny Ball-who seems out of place on a collection called Twang-and the Dave Clark 5 who began around 1960 as an instrumental act.\n\nHere can be found 4 recordings by the Pete Chester Group who began as the Chesternuts which is where the pre Shadows Hank Marvin began, Rockin' Red Pice who started with the Ted Heath Band before winding up with Lord Rockingham's X1, a group from Bristol called the Eagles - who had the name before the more famous ones - the Original Checkmates without Emile Ford who actually cut an album in their own right full of covers of American instrumentals and Cherry Wainer who was from South Africa and also from Lord Rockingham's X1 and the Flee-Rekkers who were discovered by Joe Meek and charted with their version of Greensleeves for Meek's short lived Triumph label. The foldout booklet provides some fascinating reading. \n(review by Richard at amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Twang- UK Guitar Instrumental Diamonds 58-62\n(2CD Sequel Records 2000)\n\n 1.
