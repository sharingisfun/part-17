While its predecessor, 1988's Nothing's Shocking, served as a fine introduction to the group, Ritual de lo Habitual proved to be even more daring; few (if any) alt-rock bands have composed a pair of epics that totaled nearly 20 minutes, let alone put them back to back for full dramatic effect. While the cheerful ditty &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; is the album's best-known track, the opening &quot;Stop!&quot; is one of the band's best hard rock numbers, propelled by guitarist Dave Navarro's repetitive, trashy funk riff, while &quot;Ain't No Right&quot; remains explosive in its defiant and vicious nature. Jane's Addiction always had a knack for penning beautiful ballads with a ghostly edge, again proven by the album closer, &quot;Classic Girl.&quot; But it's the aforementioned epics that are the album's cornerstone: &quot;Three Days&quot; and &quot;Then She Did....&quot; Although Perry Farrell has never truly admitted what the two songs are about lyrically, they appear to be about an autobiographical romantic tryst between three lovers, as each composition twists and turns musically through every imaginable mood. And while the tracks &quot;No One's Leaving,&quot; &quot;Obvious,&quot; and &quot;Of Course&quot; may not be as renowned as other selections, they prove integral in the makeup of the album. Surprisingly, the band decided to call it a day just as Ritual de lo Habitual hit big, headlining the inaugural Lollapalooza tour (the brainchild of Farrell) in the summer of 1991 as their final road jaunt. Years later, it remains one of alt-rock's finest moments.\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. Stop\n   2. No One's Leaving\n   3. Ain't No Right\n   4. Obvious\n   5. Been Caught Stealing\n   6. Three Days\n   7.
