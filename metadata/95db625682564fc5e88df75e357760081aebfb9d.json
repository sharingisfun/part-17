As swiftly as it came, it disappeared, leaving no trace. Over the four decades since, Ebola has emerged sporadically, each time to devastating effect. It can kill up to 90 percent of its victims. In between these outbreaks, it is untraceable, hiding deep in the jungle. The search is on to find EbolaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elusive host animal. And until we find it, Ebola will continue to strike. Acclaimed science writer and explorer David Quammen first came near the virus while he was traveling in the jungles of Gabon, accompanied by local men whose village had been devastated by a recent outbreak. Here he tells the story of EbolaÃ¢â‚¬â€its past, present, and its unknowable future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95db625682564fc5e88df75e357760081aebfb9d","amp;dn":"Ebola%3A+The+Natural+and+Human+History+of+a+Deadly+Virus+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95db625682564fc5e88df75e357760081aebfb9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,219,98,86,130,86,79,197,232,141,247,94,53,119,96,8,26,235,251,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
