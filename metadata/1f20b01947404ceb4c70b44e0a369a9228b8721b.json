(2141 Kbps). Quality is not crystal but acceptable (old movie).\n\nLanguages: english\nSubtitles: none\n\n It stars: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Nyree Dawn Porter, Denholm Elliott, and Jon Pertwee. \n\n\nThis anthology picture about a bad-luck mansion is a thriller with four episodes--all framed by a police investigation. A review of the files of the local policeman (John Bennett) shows that everyone who has owned the mansion has died in a horrible fashion. \nIn the first episode, &quot;Method for Murder,&quot; the obsessions of a mystery writer (Denholm Elliott) provide his wife with an opportunity to do him in. \nIn the second, &quot;Waxworks,&quot; Peter Cushing is the unhappy recipient of the attentions of a jealous husband. \nThe third, &quot;Sweets to the Sweet,&quot; has Christopher Lee fall victim to his charming little daughter, who plays with voodoo dolls. \nIn &quot;The Cloak,&quot; Jon Pertwee (best known for his TV portrayal of Dr. Who) is a horror-film star who insists on authenticity in his costumes. Somehow, he is given the cloak of a real vampire, with humorously ghoulish results.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f20b01947404ceb4c70b44e0a369a9228b8721b","amp;dn":"Dom+Wampir%26Atilde%3B%26sup3%3Bw+--+The+House+That+Dripped+Blood+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f20b01947404ceb4c70b44e0a369a9228b8721b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,32,176,25,71,64,76,235,76,112,180,78,10,54,154,146,40,184,114,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
