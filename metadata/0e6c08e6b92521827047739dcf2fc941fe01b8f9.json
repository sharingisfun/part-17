This time three contemporary families live as their own forebears did. They must follow the social conventions of the time, but whether they're destined for luxury or poverty is determined by their family history, which is a nice touch. You just know the posh family (the Meadows) are going to end up in the working-class house but they take to the hardship well, even though daughter Saskia reveals, &quot;I thought we'd do chores when we were on camera but when you said cut, we'd go off, have a chat and a bit of food. This is a bit of a shock.&quot; The other families struggle for very different reasons. It seems that living history is a bit harsher than those sepia-tinted photos would have us believe.\n\n\n\n\n3)  The Home Front \nIn this episode, the families face life on the home front with Great Britain at war; they pull together to survive and do their bit for the war effort, as well as enduring a night in a bomb shelter; and Susie Meadows finds herself responsible for everyone's safety. The Taylor family are now without servants and, just as Adele finally gets to run her own home, the family is split apart once more as husband Michael is called up for national service and her children are evacuated. With the families in disarray, there is much relief as VE Day arrives, and by the end of the era the close-knit community say goodbye to the Goldings.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1988/thefamilyscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8146/thefamilyscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/3715/thefamilyscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4421/thefamilyscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/1397/thefamilyscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2185/thefamilyscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4329/thefamilyscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/3914/thefamilyscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/6421/thefamilyscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1619 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/phil-suzie-meadows-turn-back-time-family&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20High%20Street&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6c08e6b92521827047739dcf2fc941fe01b8f9","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+Family+3of5+The+Home+Front+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6c08e6b92521827047739dcf2fc941fe01b8f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,108,8,230,185,37,33,130,112,71,115,157,207,47,201,65,254,1,184,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
