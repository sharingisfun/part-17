Edward Lucie-Smith discusses major subjects and issues: Magic Realism, Expressionism and other concepts shared with Latin American literature; the great muralists Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco; the interaction of politics, society and art; the continuing interest in folk art; and the dialogue between avant-garde European and North American movements and &quot;indigenist&quot; thinking in the work of artists such as Wifredo Lam, Matta, Rufino Tamayo and Frida Kahlo.
