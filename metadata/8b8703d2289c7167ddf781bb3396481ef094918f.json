The story of the Crusades is remembered as a tale of religious fanaticism and unspeakable violence, but now fresh research, eyewitness testimony, and contemporary evidence from both the Christian and Islamic worlds shed new light on how these two great religions waged war in the name of God.\n\nPart 3: Victory and Defeat\nIn the concluding episode of the three-part series, Dr Thomas Asbridge reveals that the outcome of these epic holy wars was decided not on the hallowed ground of Jerusalem, but in Egypt. As trade blossomed between Christians and Muslims and the Mongol hordes arrived from Asia, a saintly French king - afire with crusading zeal - and the most remarkable Muslim leader of the Middle Ages fought for ultimate victory in the East. Drawing upon eyewitness chronicles and the latest archaeological evidence, Dr Asbridge argues that it was a fearsome slave-warrior from the Russian Steppes - now forgotten in the West - who finally sealed the fate of the crusades. And, most controversially of all, Asbridge challenges the popular misconception that the medieval crusades sparked a clash of civilisations between Islam and the West that continues to this day.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1530 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime per Part 59.mins\nNumber of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 701 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b8703d2289c7167ddf781bb3396481ef094918f","amp;dn":"BBC.The.Crusades.3of3.Victory.and.Defeat.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b8703d2289c7167ddf781bb3396481ef094918f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,135,3,210,40,156,113,103,221,247,129,187,51,150,72,30,240,148,145,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
