They grab innocent schoolgirl Candy (Susan Sennet) off the street and place a call to her father (Ben Piazza), demanding that he slip them all the jewelry from the store he manages. Unfortunately, the crooks didn&amp;#039;t do enough research on their targets and they quickly discover that greed and frustrated desires can complicate the simplest plan. Meanwhile, a mute, possibly autistic little boy (Cristophe) witnesses the crooks hiding Candy and makes increasingly frantic attempts to warn the adults around him.\n\nSimply put, The Candy Snatchers delivers everything one could hope for from a 1970&amp;#039;s exploitation flick: there&amp;#039;s sex, violence, sleazy characters with sociopathic attitudes, all types of bad behavior, sudden and shocking plot turnabouts and an ending that hits like a punch to the gut. Bryan Gindoff&amp;#039;s screenplay hits all these marks in an inspired style, further enhancing the story&amp;#039;s dark atmosphere with caustic, highly quotable dialogue.\n\n...\n\nVideo: XVID 672x384 23.98fps [Stream 00]\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps [Stream 01]\n\nthis is not my own rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f1a76785328046d58f90a31d21385e01936948a","amp;dn":"The+Candy+Snatchers+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f1a76785328046d58f90a31d21385e01936948a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,26,118,120,83,40,4,109,88,249,10,49,210,19,133,224,25,54,148,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
