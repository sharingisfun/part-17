Wesley Townsend &quot;westknife&quot;[/b]\nI am mostly a heavy metal fan, I am a big fan of bands like Sabbath, Maiden, Zeppelin, Purple, and you know, all the classics. I kind of bought Headhunters on a whim after seeing it on someone's list on this site. I have had it about 3 days, and it is already one of my all-time favorite albums. I know next to nothing about jazz OR funk, but all I know is that this record kicks my ....\n\nThe first half, &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; consists of I guess the most accessible material on the album. I knew I would become a fan as soon as I listened to these two killer songs. The last half also has 2 songs, &quot;Sly&quot; and &quot;Vein Melter&quot;. I'll be honest, I did not really care for these songs when I first heard them, but I made myself listen to the whole album a few more times, and now I think that the 2nd side of the album has just as much, if not more, redeeming value than the 1st half!\n\nAll of the musicians on Headhunters are playing brilliantly. The saxophone player can tear such a good solo! The drum and bass rhythm section are killer, they lay down such a tight groove. And of course, there is Herbie Hancock himself, who plays a variety of keyboard instruments. He plays synthesizers and even a &quot;clavinet&quot; (this is new to me) that sounds like a guitar. \n\nThis guy rocks so hard! Every song is different and unique, and all 42 minutes of it blow me away. The solos (keys and saxophone) are so awesome, and they are so long! They seem to last forever, and the jams just get more and more intense second after second.\n\nNow I will have to get more music by Herbie he rocks! (and his band, of course, they deserve plenty of credit.) People seem to be saying that Maiden Voyage is great, so I guess I'll get that next.....[/quote]\n\n[img]http://image.bayimg.com/0bc33eeafdf85397837a6054e265363072e42b34.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Herbie Hancock - Head Hunters (CK 32731)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Herbie Hancock\nAlbum................: Head Hunters (CK 32731)\nGenre................: Fusion\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1973\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 52 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
