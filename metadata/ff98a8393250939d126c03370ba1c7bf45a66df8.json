She is in the top 100 best selling music artists with over 90 million albums sold worldwide,[1][2] 26.5 million of those in the United States alone.[3] She has won seven Grammy Awards, placing her among the most successful crossover performers in Latin music to date\nGloria MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Milagrosa Fajardo was born September 1, 1957 in Havana, Cuba, to Jose and Gloria Fajardo. Her mother's father Leonardo Garcia emigrated to Cuba from Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain where he married a woman from LogroÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±o, Spain.[4][5] The family fled to Lafayette, Indiana, during the Cuban Revolution. A few years after they moved, Jose joined the US military during the Vietnam War. Her father had been a Cuban soldier and bodyguard of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.[6]\nIn the mid-1980s, Gloria Estefan was part of the group Miami Sound Machine. In 1984, Miami Sound Machine released their first Epic/Columbia album, Eyes Of Innocence, which contained the dance hit &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; as well as the ballad &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;. Their more successful follow-up album Primitive Love was released in 1985 launching three Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: &quot;Conga&quot; (U.S. #10), &quot;Words Get In The WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (U.S. #5), and &quot;Bad Boy&quot; (U.S. #8) became follow up hits in the U.S. and around the world. &quot;Words Get In The Way&quot; reached #1 on the US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, establishing that the group could perform pop ballads as successfully as dance tunes. The song &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot; was also released that year and was part of the blockbuster movie Top Gun.\nTheir next album, 1987ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Let It Loose, went multi-platinum, with six million copies sold in the US. It featured the following hits: &quot;Anything For You&quot; (#1 Hot 100), &quot;1, 2, 3&quot; (#3 Hot 100), &quot;Betcha Say That&quot; (#36 Hot 100), &quot;Rhythm Is Gonna Get You&quot; (#5 Hot 100), and &quot;Can't Stay Away From You&quot; (#6 Hot 100). &quot;CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Stay Away From You,&quot; &quot;Anything For You&quot; and &quot;1-2-3&quot; were all #1 Adult Contemporary hits as well.\nIn 1988, Estefan took top billing and the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name changed to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine. Beginning in 1989, the group's name was dropped altogether. Estefan was credited as a solo artist, though the ever-changing line-up of Miami Sound Machine continues as her backing band to this day.\nIn 1989, after the worldwide chart success of single &quot;Anything For You&quot;, her Let it Loose album was repackaged as Anything For You. It became the band's first UK #1 album, selling over a million copies. It was the biggest selling album of the year in The Netherlands, staying at #1 for 22 weeks. The album also took top honors in Australia and Canada, launching Estefan to superstar status.In late 1989, she released her best-selling album to date, Cuts Both Ways. The album included the hit singles &quot;Don't Wanna Lose You&quot; (a Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit), &quot;Oye mi Canto (Hear my Voice)&quot;, &quot;Here We Are&quot;, &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot; (#1 on the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart) and &quot;Get on Your Feet.&quot;\nWhile touring in support of Cuts Both Ways on March 20, 1990, near Scranton, Pennsylvania, Estefan was critically injured, suffering a fractured spine when a speeding semi-truck crashed into her tour bus. She was taken to Community Medical Center's Intensive Care Unit and the next day was flown by helicopter to New York City, where surgeons at the Hospital for Special Surgery permanently implanted two titanium rods to stabilize her Vertebral column. Her rehabilitation required almost a year of intensive physical therapy by Michael Klepper, but she achieved a complete recovery. She returned to an international tour ten months after the accident.\nEstefan returned to the charts with a concept album, Into the Light, in 1991. She performed &quot;Coming Out of the Dark&quot; for the first time on the American Music Awards in January 1991, receiving a standing ovation as she took stage. &quot;I was worried so much about crying before I finished that I completely didn't prepare for crying before I started.&quot;, Estefan said backstage after the performance.[citation needed] &quot;Coming Out of the Dark&quot; reached #1 in the U.S. as a single a few months later. Other popular singles were &quot;Seal Our Fate&quot; and &quot;Live for Loving You&quot;. The album peaked at number five at the Billboard album chart, becoming her highest debut; it also peaked at number two on the British albums chart. Eventually the album went platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. The Into the Light World Tour covered 100 cities in five countries and was seen by more than 10 million people worldwide.\nShe followed up Into the Light with her first greatest-hits album, Gloria Estefan Greatest Hits. It was released in 1992, and included the U.S. hit ballads &quot;Always Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I See Your Smile&quot; along with the international hit dance track &quot;Go Away&quot;. Also in 1992, Estefan sang backup on fellow Cuban-American singer-songwriter Jon Secada's breakthrough single &quot;Just Another Day&quot;. She spent much of 1992 in Miami, helping relief efforts for victims of Hurricane Andrew.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff98a8393250939d126c03370ba1c7bf45a66df8","amp;dn":"Gloria+Estefan-18+cd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff98a8393250939d126c03370ba1c7bf45a66df8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,152,168,57,50,80,147,157,18,108,3,55,11,161,199,191,69,166,109,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
