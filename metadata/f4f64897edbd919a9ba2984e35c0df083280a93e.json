The tiny mountain town of South Park, Colorado has proven that beyond a doubt for the last eight seasons. Fortunately for fans of this Comedy Central pillar, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker obviously had no lack of ideas for their ninth season. Over the course of fourteen episodes, Mr. Garrison gets a sex change, Cartman thwarts a hippie music festival that threatens to destroy the town, the boys (Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny) start a talent agency, Kenny leads angelic forces in an epic battle against SatanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minions at the gates of heaven, and the boys become really bad at losing at baseball. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the first half of the season. The most notable episode from this season is definitely the controversial &quot;Trapped in the Closet,&quot; where Stan is &quot;recognized&quot; as the reincarnation of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, and a dejected Tom Cruise locks himself in StanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s closet. Naturally, over the course of the episode, TV reporters get to decry that &quot;Tom Cruise still wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come out of the closet.&quot; It's funny enough on its own, but when John Travolta and R. Kelly end up in the closet as well (all singing together &quot;Now IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m trapped in the closet. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m trapped in the closet too&quot;), thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth the price of the set on its own.\n\nAfter nine seasons itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also nice to see that one of the series key running gags, the perpetual cluelessness of the adults, still isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t getting old. It's as if the adult townspeople only know how to behave based on movies theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen (this seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cinematic targets include Rocky (in &quot;The Losing Edge&quot;), The Day After Tomorrow (&quot;Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow&quot;), and Pet Cemetery (&quot;Marjorine&quot;), and their inevitably clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©d over-reactions still provide many of the showÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best moments. The commentaries from Parker and Stone are once again typically short; they usually last only a few minutes into each show before they end it with &quot;Ok, onto the next show now&quot; not even trying to conceal that they really want to get through the recording session as quickly as possible. That might seem lame on other shows, but on South Park--a show where 8-year-olds send a talking killer whale to the moon through the Mexican Space Agency for $200,--somehow itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s totally fitting. --Daniel Vancini\n\nAudio For All Eipsodes:\n\nEncoding - VBR (Variable BitRate)\nCodec - 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nBitRate - 107kb/s\nLanguage - English\n\nVideo For All Eipsodes:\n\nVideo Stream - MPEG-4\nCodec - XViD (XviD ISO MPEG-4)\nAverage BitRate of Video Stream - 771kb/s\nFrames per Second - 23.976\nResolution - 512 x 384\n\nEpisode List:\n\n&quot;Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina&quot;\nMr. Garrison goes to great lengths to get what he's always wanted: a sex change. As he enjoys his new womanly attributes, the rest of the town gets in touch with their inner feelings too. Meanwhile, Kyle wrestles with the fact that Jews just aren't good at basketball.\n\n&quot;Die Hippie, Die&quot;\nCartman warns the citizens of South Park that it will only be a matter of days before the town becomes the Hippie Capital of the World. No one will believe him until they find out the hippies plan to stage a weeklong music fest. The town has no choice but to turn to Cartman for help. He then puts his plan to eradicate his lifelong enemies in motion.\n\n&quot;Wing&quot;\nAs talent agents, Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny can bank 10% of their clientÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s earnings. After they pool all their resources to impress their one and only client, another agency steals him away. Desperate to earn their money back, they take on another client with plans to launch her on a new reality show.\n\n&quot;Best Friends Forever&quot;\nCartman's jealous when Kenny gets the last new portable gaming device before the toy store runs out. Will Cartman and Kenny be able to stay best friends forever?\n\n&quot;The Losing Edge&quot;\nA winning season and overzealous parents threaten to ruin the entire summer, when the boys of South Park head to the State Championship. The kids desperately want an end to the boring baseball season. The problem is theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve won so many games that now theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in the playoffs. Just one loss would mean the seasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finished and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be free from AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favorite pastime for the entire summer.\n\n&quot;The Death of Eric Cartman&quot;\nButters is freaked out when he thinks he can communicate with the dead. Although his parents have made it clear to him there are no such things as ghosts, Butters is sure one is haunting him. Butters knows he has to give up his ghost pal or be put into a mental institution.\n\n&quot;Erection Day&quot;\nAll the kids are getting ready for the big South Park Elementary Talent Show and Jimmy can't wait to perform his new comedy routines. But lately, just like generations of little boys before him, Jimmy's noticed that one of his body parts has a mind of its own. Knowing he can't get up in front of the entire school in an excited state, Jimmy must find a way to gain control of his raging hormones in time to perform in the show.\n\n&quot;Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow&quot;\nA global warming state of emergency is declared in South Park. The world's largest beaver dam breaks and floods the adjacent town of Beaverton. As the victims wait for help to arrive, everyone in South Park tackles priority number one: who is to blame? Only Stan and Cartman know who's really at fault.\n\n&quot;Marjorine&quot;\nThe 4th grade girls are having a sleepover. It's imperative that the boys find out what goes on behind those closed doors. Butters is picked to be the boy who must fake his death, become a girl and infiltrate this age-old feminine tradition.\n\n&quot;Follow That Egg&quot;\nMrs. Garrison realizes he still has feelings for Mr. Slave. But, Mr. Slave has moved on. He plans to marry his new love as soon as the Governor signs the same-sex marriage bill. Mrs. Garrison leads the charge against gay marriage.\n\n&quot;Ginger Kids&quot;\nCartman suffers from a mysterious and sudden on-set of the disease, Gingervitus, after teasing all the ginger kids at school. Sick and tired of being ripped-on because he now has red hair, light skin and freckles, he rallies all ginger kids everywhere to fight against discrimination.\n\n&quot;Trapped in the Closet&quot;\nReligious leaders recognize Stan as the second coming and a whole soap opera unfolds with the help of R. Kelly. This is the episode that brought controversy to Comedy Central when Tom Cruise allegedly had the episode pulled from rotation. Then, Isaac Hayes (Chef) left the show, feeling that Scientologists were portrayed unfairly.\n\n&quot;Free Willzyx&quot;\nA &quot;talking&quot; whale inspires the fourth-graders to risk everything to return him to his family. With the police on their tails, the boys enlist the help of a foreign government and embark upon an adventure. One in which the boys learn just how far you would go for a friend.\n\n&quot;Bloody Mary&quot;\nStan is embarrassed in front of his friends when his dad is arrested for drunk driving. In a neighboring town, a bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary is discovered and the faithful are flocking to the site hoping to be healed. Stan's dad is sure the bleeding Virgin can cure him of his drinking.\n\n\nOther Information:\n\n\nI burned this complete season to a DVD-R and it works perfectly on XBOX 360 as long as you have the multimedia update available from XBOX Live.
