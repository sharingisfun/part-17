The song, chronicling the events surrounding LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s marriage to Yoko Ono, was the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 17th and final UK number one single. \n\nAuthored by Lennon while on his honeymoon in Paris, it tells of the events of his marriage, in March 1969, to Ono, and their publicly held honeymoon activities, including their &quot;Bed-In&quot; at the Amsterdam Hilton Hotel and their demonstration of &quot;bagism&quot;.\n\nLennon brought the song to McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home on 14 April 1969, before recording it that evening. &quot;Paul knew that people were being nasty to John, and he just wanted to make it well for him,&quot; said Ono. &quot;Paul has a very brotherly side to him.&quot;\n\nThe song was recorded without George Harrison (who was on holiday) and Ringo Starr (who was filming The Magic Christian). In his biography, McCartney recalls that Lennon had a sudden inspiration for the song and had suggested that the two of them should record it immediately, without waiting for the other Beatles to return.\n\nThe single became the Beatles' 17th and final UK number one; it reached number eight in the US.\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. They became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed act in the rock music era. The group's best-known lineup consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as &quot;Beatlemania&quot;, but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_John_and_Yoko&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_John_and_Yoko&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaOCIaAeB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaOCIaAeB&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:08\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
