The first, Shine Like It Does, was released on Rhino in the U.S. in 2001. The following year, both The Years 1979-1997 (Australia) and Definitive INXS (U.K.) were issued. Shine Like It Does and The Years are very similar, differing only with a handful of track selections. Definitive INXS, while also a double disc, is considerably different. The first disc sticks strictly to the biggest hits -- like &quot;What You Need,&quot; &quot;Need You Tonight,&quot; &quot;Never Tear Us Apart,&quot; and &quot;New Sensation&quot; -- and also adds the same pair of previously unreleased tracks that appear on The Years (&quot;Salvation Jane&quot; and &quot;Tight&quot;). The second disc is devoted strictly to video footage, combining live footage with the a couple of the videos that helped make the group so popular. While it's nice to have the disc of videos, it's the type of thing that only hardcore fans -- and not people who just want the hits -- would care to have. The saving grace is that Definitive INXS goes for the price of a single disc, but a band with too many key moments to fit onto one disc is deserving of better, like Shine Like It Does and The Years.\nAll Music Review by Andy Kellman\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Need You Tonight\n[02] What You Need\n[03] Disappear\n[04] Baby Don't Cry\n[05] Elegantly Wasted\n[06] Mystify\n[07] Just Keep Walking\n[08] Suicide Blonde\n[09] Never Tear Us Apart\n[10] Shining Star\n[11] Beautiful Girl\n[12] Listen Like Thieves\n[13] New Sensation\n[14] Bitter Tears\n[15] Original Sin\n[16] Devil Inside\n[17] The Gift\n[18] By My Side\n[19] Born To Be Wild\n[20] Salvation Jane\n[21] Tight\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:18m:26s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Mystify (Live From America)\n[02] Suicide Blonde (Live From America)\n[03] New Sensation (Live From America)\n[04] Tight (The Automator Remix)\n[05] Precious Heart (Tall Paul Vs.
