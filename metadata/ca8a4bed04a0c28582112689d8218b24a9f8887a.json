Even nowdays, the effervescence of ritual and liveliness of the arts still mutualy intensifiy one another. The various religious events each correspond to a specific musical form, characterised by its repertory, its style and the tuning of the instruments used.\n\nReview\nAny orchestra that claims its two most virtuoso musicians are the &quot;principal drummer&quot; (Made Trip) and the &quot;first cymbalist&quot; is going to spark my curiosity. The notes explain that fresh inspiration for Balinese Gamelan music has come mainly from the Buleleng district, where these musicians of the Kebyar style are from. Musicians and audiences alike treasure the kebyar style for its creation of new forms as well as the highly technical performance of traditional compositions. ~ Raissa St. Pierre, Original Music, All Music Guide\n\nHiQuality: 320Kbps + full booklet scans (byAmbroseBierce)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8a4bed04a0c28582112689d8218b24a9f8887a","amp;dn":"BALI+-+Music+From+the+North-West+of+Bali","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8a4bed04a0c28582112689d8218b24a9f8887a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,138,75,237,4,160,194,133,130,17,38,137,216,33,139,36,169,248,136,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
