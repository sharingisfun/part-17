On the band's second\nmajor-label offering, with the styles differing so much from song to song, vocalist\nCorey Taylor shows that he is much more than one of Slipknot's masked men. Rounded out by guitarists James Root (another Slipknot member) and Josh Rand, bassist Shawn\nEconomaki, and new drummer Roy Mayorga, Stone Sour make a distinct effort to create\nlayers on their songs that many bands don't have these days.\n\nAlthough Taylor may receive the spotlight much of the time because of his frontman\nstatus, most of the credit really needs to go to the amazing guitar work by James Root and Josh Rand. The two guitarists provide the most interesting aspects of the album and make Come What(ever) May much more than just another metal band. From the first track &quot;30/30-150&quot;, in which a beautifully executed dual guitar solo is played by Root and Rand, listeners know they can at least expect quality axe work.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.30,30-150                                            [04:18]\n02.Come what(ever) may                                  [03:40]\n03.Hell &amp; consequences                                  [03:31]\n04.Sillyworld                                           [04:09]\n05.Made of scars                                        [03:24]\n06.Reborn                                               [03:13]\n07.Your god                                             [04:43]\n08.Through glass                                        [04:43]\n09.Socio                                                [03:20]\n10.1st person                                           [04:02]\n11.Cardiff                                              [04:42]\n12.Zzyzx rd.
