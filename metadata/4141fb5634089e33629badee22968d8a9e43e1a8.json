It shapes and transforms our everyday world.  Sounds and music are embedded in almost every aspect of daily life, from communication and artistic expression to commerce, politics, and our social and cultural identities.\n\nThis course will provide an overview of the fundamental principles of sound and the factors that determine our audio perception. It will explore techniques of recording, mixing, processing, synthesis, sampling, analysis, and editing of digital audio using freely distributed audio production software for both PC and Mac. Students will also learn an array of sound design and editing techniques for use in film and web-based media, art installations, soundscape creations, or live and internet music performances.\n\nCourse Syllabus\nWeek 1: The Nature of Sound\nSound\nSound Waves\nSix Perceptual Attributes of Auditory Events\nPitch, Loudness and Intensity, Timbre, Perceived Duration, Spatial Location, Reverberant Environment\nRepresenting Sound in Electrical and Digital Domains, Digital Filters\nMusic perception and meaning\nMusic and Cognition, Motion and Sensation, Music and Emotion\nMusic, Language, Syntax\nMusic and the Environment\nThe Soundscape, Animal Sounds\n\nWeek 2: Music Technology I\nRecording\nMicrophones, Digital File Formats, Sampling\nAnalysis\nSpectral and Fourier Analysis, Analysis-Resynthesis\nProcessing\nRing and Amplitude Modulation, Mixing and Delays, Filters and Distortion\nTime Stretching, Pitch Shifting, AutoTune, Spatialization\n\nWeek 3: Music Technology II\nSynthesis\nSound Synthesis\nWavetable, Frequency Modulation, Granular Synthesis\nPhysical Modeling\n\nWeek 4: Music Technology III\nInteraction and Networks\nLaptop Ensembles, Mobile Music, Music Information Retrieval\nComposition\nRoles for Computers in Composition, Algorithmic Composition\nSonification, Data-Driven Composition\nSound and Film\nSound and Image, Sound and Narrative\n\nMore course info: https://www.coursera.org/course/digitalsounddesign\n\nType: mp4\nSize: 960x540 @ 29fps\nAudio bitrate: 126kpbs\nEnglish subtitles included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4141fb5634089e33629badee22968d8a9e43e1a8","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Digital+Sound+Design","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4141fb5634089e33629badee22968d8a9e43e1a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,65,251,86,52,8,158,51,98,155,173,238,34,150,141,138,158,67,225,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
