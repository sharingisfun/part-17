Less than two months--hardly any time at all--had elapsed after September 11 when South Park broadcast an episode that addressed the tragedy. Wit and satire have their place, of course, but in the aftermath of epochal upheaval, sometimes good old-fashioned ridicule can diminish an enemy and help to heal a grieving nation. The Emmy-nominated episode \\&quot;Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants\\&quot; does the cathartic trick, as Cartman plays Bugs Bunny to Osama\\'s Elmer Fudd with a series of humiliating pranks, one of which reveals Osama\\'s miniscule Bin Laden. \\&quot;This is how we deal with stuff,\\&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone remark during the \\&quot;commentary-mini,\\&quot; a listening option on each episode. In this fifth season, \\&quot;It Hits the Fan,\\&quot; to quote the title of the notorious season-opening episode, in which the \\&quot;S\\&quot; word is uttered a staggering 162 times. In another series milestone, \\&quot;Kenny Dies,\\&quot; and actually stays dead (at least until season 6). One of South Park\\'s best characters gets his own half hour in \\&quot;Butters\\' Very Own Episode,\\&quot; while one of the series\\' absolute worst, \\&quot;Towelie,\\&quot; also gets his. Over the course of these 14 episodes, many life lessons are learned about sex education (\\&quot;Proper Condom Use\\&quot;), prejudice (\\&quot;Here Comes the Neighborhood\\&quot;) and stereotypes (\\&quot;The Entity\\&quot;). But perhaps the most valuable lesson is: \\&quot;Don\\'t tick off Cartman,\\&quot; as witness his diabolical revenge against the unfortunate ninth grader who rips him off in \\&quot;Scott Tenorman Must Die.\\&quot;\n\nThe genius of South Park is its uncanny ability to make satiric hay with such otherwise sure-fire comedy killers as aborted fetuses, concentration camps, and cancer (which becomes instantly funny when the words \\&quot;up the a**\\&quot; are added to it, and funnier still when spoken by actual members of Radiohead). 2001 was a rough year for America, and while this country\\'s \\&quot;problems\\&quot; provide Stone and Parker with a fount of material (most of it objectionable), we can take odd comfort that they remain vigilant in rooting for their \\&quot;team.\\&quot; --Donald Liebenson\n\nAudio For All Episodes:\n\nEncoding - Variable BitRate (VBR)\nCodec - 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nBitRate - 109kb/s\nLanguage - English\n\nVideo For All Episodes:\n\nVideo Stream - MPG4\nCodec - XViD\nName of Codec - XviD ISO MPEG-4\nAverage BitRate of Video Stream - 832kb/s\nFrames Per Second - 23.976\nResolution - 512x384\n\nEpisode Index:\n\n\\&quot;It Hits the Fan\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 6-20-2001: : In the fifth-season opener, Cartman says the \\&quot;S\\&quot; word.\n\n\\&quot;Cripple Fight\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 6-27-2001\nBig Gay Al is fired as scoutmaster and the boys come to his aid.\n\n\\&quot;Super Best Friends\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 7-4-2001\nThe boys are brainwashed by a cult led by David Blaine.\n\n\\&quot;Scott Tenorman Must Die\nOriginal Air Date: 7-11-2001\nRadiohead plays a role in Cartman\\'s plan for revenge against an eighth-grader who wronged him.\n\n\\&quot;Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 7-182001\nTerrance and Phillip break up and the guys try to get them back together.\n\n\\&quot;Cartmanland\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 7-25-2001\nCartman inherits a fortune from his grandmother and wants to build an amusement park.\n\n\\&quot;Proper Condom Use\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 8-1-2001\nThe kids at South Park elementary go through a sex education class.\n\n\\&quot;Towelie\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 8-8-2001\nThe boys get a new video game system and their plans for the next 38 hours is to play it, until they discover Towelie, a government secret, genetically engineered towel that gets his special powers from... gettinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ high.\n\n\\&quot;Osama Bin Laden has Farty Pants\\&quot;\nOriginal Air Date: 11-7-2001\nThe boys decide to get into the patriotic spirit by heeding the President\\'s advice to send money to the children of Afghanistan.

If you do not have the update it is simple to get. Simply put the DVD-R into your XBOX 360, then go to video library, current disc, and play an episode and if you do not already have the update it will direct you to the download page of it. The update is free of charge.
