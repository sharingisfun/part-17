This is a collection of hock hop by Big Smo down in Tennessee. I can only seed on the weekends. I will seed as much as I can but I need your help to seed this and keep it alive.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002 Big Smo self released his first album, Kuntry Kitchen, named after the old\ncountry store on *Yayoda Ranch* a 32 acre farm where Big Smo resides. The album\nreceived rave reviews and Big Smo was on his way to becoming a local hip hop force.\nA few years later he had released his sophomore album, The True South, and was\nlooking to expand on his already growing musical career. He began recording and\ndeveloping new artists in the studio he had custom built on the ranch and embarked on\nlearning the field of video production as well. Before long Big Smo was filming videos\nfor the popular Tennessee rapper Haystak, the two instantly hit it off. Their business\nrelationship snowballed, and soon Big Smo was hired as Haystak\\'s hype man for live\nevents. He quickly became the official opening act, and even landed the role of co-\nproducer on two Haystak albums - Hard-2-Love and Came A Long Way.\nIn early 2010 Big Smo joined forces with some industry executives to form NME\nLines Entertainment. The company\\'s first release is a new Big Smo studio album,\nappropriately titled American Made. Songs like \\&quot;My Life In A Jar\\&quot; , \\&quot;Old Dirt Road,\\&quot;\nand \\&quot;Kickin It In Tennessee\\&quot; send the listener on a thrill ride through the country in\nan old Ford with no brakes. Guest appearances by Haystak, Jelly Roll, Lil\\' White, and\noutlaw country singer Charlie Bonnet III add flavor to an already infectious slab of\nmusical delight. If Kid Rock and Run D.M.C. had a love child on the set of Hee-Haw he\nwould be named Big Smo. Look out world - this man cannot be stopped.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a913f28ec67da648a41f9569840d1d80e2d432d4","amp;dn":"Big+Smo+Hick+Hop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a913f28ec67da648a41f9569840d1d80e2d432d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,19,242,142,198,125,166,72,164,31,149,105,132,13,29,128,226,212,50,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
