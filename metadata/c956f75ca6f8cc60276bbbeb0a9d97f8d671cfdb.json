Learn how to program this feature-rich virtual instrument in this revealing tutorial by synth specialist, Mo Volans...\n\nNot big... Not huge... Nor gigantic... But MASSIVE! ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what this awesome powerhouse synth is all about! However, a massive synth needs a bit of massive explaining. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why we handed this project over to Mo Volans; Mo knows synthesis inside out. And in this tutorial youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get a road map of the essential functions, routings, waveforms and modulation options that make Massive such a unique synth and a sound designerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream come true!\n\nRight from the beginning youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn all about MassiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic design and synthesis modules. Mo starts out with a look at all of this synthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oscillators and sound generators. Next up youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll dive into the amazing multi-mode filters, effects and master sections. Once these main features are covered, Mo makes sure that you get a deep look at MassiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more in-depth features: the advanced envelopes, complex modulators, as well as the different performance controls that lurk beneath the virtual faceplate of this NI beast.\n\nThe second part of this tutorial digs deeper into programming. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no better way to learn synthesis that by watching a pro like Mo Volans take the controls and build some sonic masterpieces from scratch.\n\nSo if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking to design those really big, huge, gigantic, MASSIVE sounds, sit back and learn some cool synthesis techniques from MPVÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s synth expert, Mo Volans.
