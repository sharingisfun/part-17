The duo are joined on the album by some talented guest stars: Eric Tingstad (guitar), Nancy Rumbel (woodwinds), Walter Gray (cello), Gary Lanz (guitar), Keith Lowe (bass), and Alonzo Davideo (guitar), although piano clearly dominates the recording. Eleven of the album's fourteen tracks are originalsÃ¢â‚¬â€œunusual for a Christmas album but also a welcome change from the norm in this genre. A mixture of instrumentals and vocals is also a nice touch and gives the recording even broader appeal. Amarie's voice is a thing of rare beautyÃ¢â‚¬â€œcrystal clear (her wonderful annunciation makes it easy to understand the new songs' lyrics), incredibly expressive, and heart-breakingly beautiful to hear, whether she is singing barely above a whisper or hitting an emotive crescendo. Lanz's playing is, as long-time fans have to come to expect, the very definition of superb control of nuance and infusion of sincerity and warmth.\n\nfor more read here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/forever-christmas/id938144762&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/forever-christmas/id938144762&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBiography\nOne of the most popular artists in the solo instrumental and adult-alternative spheres, Lanz played in several rock bands during his teens, then began developing his style as a solo pianist in a small Seattle nightclub. He introduced some of his originals into the bar's required mix of standards and pop tunes, receiving such a positive response from patrons that, before long, he was playing his own material almost exclusively. His early albums of solo piano works are still among the Narada label's best-sellers. His two collaborative efforts with guitarist Paul Speer also hit the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart; yet as Lanz's national popularity grew, he began to experiment with works for larger and larger ensembles, culminating in full orchestral accompaniments on Skyline Firedance (1990). With 1991's Return to the Heart, he journeyed back to his solo piano roots, and made his vocal debut on 1993's Bridge of Dreams. Lanz remained prolific throughout the decade, resurfacing in 1994 with Christmas Eve; Sacred Road followed in 1996, and two years later he returned with Songs from an English Garden. Next was An Evening with David Lanz, issued in 1999; East of the Moon appeared a year later.\n\n\n\nOriginal Release Date: November 11, 2014\nLabel: Dkl Records\nCopyright: 2014 David Lanz, Kristin Lanz\nTotal Length: 45:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e281a3f7ce0ff1e05cd29a5dacdbf9af2cf130f5","amp;dn":"David+Lanz+%26amp%3B+Kristin+Amarie+-+Forever+Christmas+%282014%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e281a3f7ce0ff1e05cd29a5dacdbf9af2cf130f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,129,163,247,206,15,241,224,92,210,154,93,172,219,249,175,44,241,48,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
