He isn't alone, for as this book shows over and over, even researchers that wish that there was no survival after death, who can see no logical reason for it, have been forced to conclude on the basis of the evidence that it is a fact. In his introduction to this second edition the author points out that after rereading his work he is more struck than ever by the consistency of the evidence. Case after case reveals a consistent pattern. All I can say is that after rereading it after five years, I still think that it is one of the best-written, most comprehensive books on the subject.\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Mind, Body, Spirit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9c628ae25cb28ded7cd09ac2bd3c2cfe8537268","amp;dn":"Afterlife+by+Colin+Wilson.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9c628ae25cb28ded7cd09ac2bd3c2cfe8537268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,198,40,174,37,203,40,222,215,205,9,172,43,211,194,207,232,83,114,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
