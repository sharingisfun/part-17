In this free introduction to Cascade Style Sheets, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how CSS makes it possible for you to completely change the way document elements are presented by a user agent. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover the origins of this specification and how CSS styles work with HTML.\n\nLearn how you can choose style sheets based on the features of a given media type, including desktop screens, web-enabled phones, digital projectors, TVs, Braille devices, print documents, and even various audio renderings of a document. CSS and Documents is an excerpt from the forthcoming 4th edition of CSS: The Definitive Guide.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n- A Brief History of (Web) Style\n- Elements\n- Bringing CSS and HTML Together\n- Media Queries\n- Style Sheet Contents\n- Summary\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 36 pages\nPublisher: OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Reilly Media (September 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1449342477\nISBN-13: 978-1449342470","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62d06eb53589fd2cc2e8fbdeb4fb6ff6e59035f7","amp;dn":"CSS+And+Documents+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62d06eb53589fd2cc2e8fbdeb4fb6ff6e59035f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,208,110,181,53,137,253,44,194,232,251,222,180,251,111,246,229,144,53,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
