Memorial is the story of Em, a young woman who arrives at a hospital in Portland, Oregon with no memory of her past. A year later, she has rebuilt her life, only to find her existence thrown into turmoil after she inherits a magical shop. The kind that appears in an alley one instance and disappears the next. Em is drawn into a supernatural conflict between beings that not only represent, but are, fundamental elements of the universe itself. All of existence is at stake, so there's only a little pressure on Em, the magical shop, and a talking cat. With art by the fantastical Rich Ellis, and covers by the legendary Michael WM Kaluta.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=35528&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=35528&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://io9.com/5875968/read-an-exclusive-preview-of-memorial-a-new-fantasy-comic-from-the-author-of-izombie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://io9.com/5875968/read-an-exclusive-preview-of-memorial-a-new-fantasy-comic-from-the-author-of-izombie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/02/20/comic-review-memorial-3/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/02/20/comic-review-memorial-3/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nContains:\n\nMemorial 01.cbr\t17.1 MB\t\nMemorial 02.cbr\t15.4 MB\t\nMemorial 03.cbr\t18.2 MB\t\nMemorial 04.cbr\t16.8 MB\t\nMemorial 05.cbr\t17.0 MB\t\nMemorial 06.cbr\t17.4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6832c2250353da9eb7501971ba833e780e5c4f2b","amp;dn":"Memorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6832c2250353da9eb7501971ba833e780e5c4f2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,50,194,37,3,83,218,158,183,80,25,113,186,131,62,120,14,92,79,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
