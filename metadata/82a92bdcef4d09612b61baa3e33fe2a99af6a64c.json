The need for further fundamental, applied, and experimental research is matched by the demand for quality references that capture the multidisciplinary and multifaceted nature of the science.\r\nPresenting cutting-edge information that is applicable to many fields, Nano- and Micro-Electromechanical Systems: Fundamentals of Nano and Microengineering, Second Edition builds the theoretical foundation for understanding, modeling, controlling, simulating, and designing nano- and microsystems. The book focuses on the fundamentals of nano- and microengineering and nano- and microtechnology. It emphasizes the multidisciplinary principles of NEMS and MEMS and practical applications of the basic theory in engineering practice and technology development.\r\n\r\nSignificantly revised to reflect both fundamental and technological aspects, this second edition introduces the concepts, methods, techniques, and technologies needed to solve a wide variety of problems related to high-performance nano- and microsystems. The book is written in a textbook style and now includes homework problems, examples, and reference lists in every chapter, as well as a separate solutions manual. It is designed to satisfy the growing demands of undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and professionals in the fields of nano- and microengineering, and to enable them to contribute to the nanotechnology revolution","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a92bdcef4d09612b61baa3e33fe2a99af6a64c","amp;dn":"Nano-+and+Micro-Electromechanical+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a92bdcef4d09612b61baa3e33fe2a99af6a64c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,169,43,220,239,77,9,97,43,97,186,163,227,63,226,169,154,246,166,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
