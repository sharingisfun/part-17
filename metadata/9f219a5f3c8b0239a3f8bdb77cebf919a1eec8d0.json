Howard's sixteenth-century Puritan adventurer has captured the imaginations of readers for decades. Now all of the Savage Sword of Conan short stories from the 1970s are collected for the first time: equal parts comics adaptations of Howard's formative tales and inspired new chapters from venerable scribes Roy Thomas (Conan the Barbarian) and Don Glut (Kull the Destroyer)! Follow along Kane's restless travels with pistol and rapier as he is compelled to be a weapon of God, ridding the world of evil wherever it may be found-from the jungles of Africa to the high seas, and whether cannibal, demon, vampire, or pirate! Contains short stories from various Savage Sword of Conan and Conan Saga issues, and from Kull and the Barbarians #2 and #3, Marvel Preview #19, Monsters Unleashed, and Dracula Lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f219a5f3c8b0239a3f8bdb77cebf919a1eec8d0","amp;dn":"The_Saga_of_Solomon_Kane_%282009%29_%28digital%29_%28Minutemen-Endriago%29.c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f219a5f3c8b0239a3f8bdb77cebf919a1eec8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,33,154,95,60,139,2,57,163,248,189,183,124,235,249,25,161,238,200,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
